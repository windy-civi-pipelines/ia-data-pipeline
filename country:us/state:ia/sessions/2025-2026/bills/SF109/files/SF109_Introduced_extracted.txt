On a weekly pay period basis, the weekly earnings are the 4 weekly gross earnings. 5 b. On a biweekly pay period basis, the weekly earnings are 6 one-half of the biweekly gross earnings. 7 c.

If 21 the employee was absent from employment for personal reasons 22 during part of the thirteen calendar weeks preceding the 23 leave, the employeeâs weekly earnings shall be the amount the 24 employee would have earned had the employee worked when work 25 was available to other employees of the employer in a similar 26 occupation. A week that does not fairly reflect the employeeâs 27 customary earnings shall be replaced by the closest previous 28 week with earnings that fairly represent the employeeâs 29 customary earnings. 30 2. If on the date that an employeeâs leave begins the 31 employeeâs hourly earnings cannot be ascertained, the earnings 32 for the purpose of calculating the benefit amount shall be the 33 usual earnings for similar services where such services are 34 rendered by paid employees. 35 -8- LSB 1696XS (5) 91 je/js 8/ 24 S.F. 109 3.

The weekly leave benefit amount payable to an employee 8 for any one week shall be eighty percent of the employeeâs 9 spendable weekly earnings, but shall not exceed an amount equal 10 to two hundred percent of the statewide average weekly wage 11 as calculated by the department pursuant to section 96.1A and 12 in effect on the date that the employeeâs leave commences. 13 However, the weekly leave benefit amount shall be a minimum 14 equal to the lesser of the weekly leave benefit amount of a 15 person whose gross weekly earnings are thirty-five percent of 16 the statewide average weekly wage, or to the spendable weekly 17 earnings of the employee. 18 Sec. 13.

If an employer contests an employeeâs initial claim 27 for family leave or medical leave benefits, the employer must 28 notify the employee and the department in the manner prescribed 29 by the director within ten calendar days of the employerâs 30 receipt of notice from the department of the employeeâs filing 31 of a claim for benefits pursuant to section 96A.21, subsection 32 3. Failure to timely contest an initial application shall 33 constitute a waiver of objection to the family leave or medical 34 leave claim. 35 -9- LSB 1696XS (5) 91 je/js 9/ 24 S.F. 109 3. If the department or the employeeâs employer contests 1 an employeeâs eligibility for benefits after the employee 2 begins receiving benefits, the employee shall continue to 3 be paid benefits conditionally for any weeks for which the 4 employee files a claim for benefits. The employeeâs right to 5 retain such benefit payments shall be conditioned upon the 6 departmentâs finding that the employee is eligible for such 7 benefit payments. 8 a. At an employeeâs request, the department shall hold 9 conditional benefit payments until the department resolves the 10 employeeâs eligibility status. 11 b. Payment shall be issued promptly for any withheld benefit 12 payments if the department determines that an employee is 13 eligible for benefits. 14 c. If the department determines that an employee is 15 ineligible for the conditionally paid benefits, the employee 16 shall repay the overpayment per rules adopted by the director. 17 Sec. 14.

For family leave premiums a covered employer may deduct 35 -10- LSB 1696XS (5) 91 je/js 10/ 24 S.F. 109 up to forty-five percent of the full amount of the required 1 premiums from the wages of each employee.

A covered employer may elect to pay all or any portion of 10 its employeesâ share of the premiums for family leave benefits 11 or medical leave benefits or both. 12 6. The director shall annually set a maximum limit on the 13 amount of an employeeâs wages that are subject to a premium 14 assessment under this section that is equal to the contribution 15 and benefit base for the calendar year as determined by the 16 United States social security administration for purposes of 17 26 U.S.C.

For calendar year 2031 and subsequent calendar years, 19 the total premium rate shall be based on the family leave and 20 medical leave insurance account balance ratio as of September 21 30 of the previous year. The director shall calculate the 22 account balance ratio by dividing the balance of the family 23 leave and medical leave insurance account by the total wages 24 paid by covered employers. The division shall be carried 25 to the fourth decimal place with the remaining fraction 26 disregarded unless it amounts to five hundred thousandths or 27 more in which case the fourth decimal place shall be rounded 28 to the next higher digit. If the family leave and medical 29 leave insurance account balance ratio is any of the following 30 percentages, the premium shall be the following percentage of 31 an employeeâs wages subject to a premium assessment: 32 a. If the ratio is zero to nine hundredths of one percent, 33 the premium shall be six-tenths of one percent. 34 b. If the ratio is one-tenth of one percent to nineteen 35 -11- LSB 1696XS (5) 91 je/js 11/ 24 S.F. 109 hundredths of one percent, the premium shall be five-tenths of 1 one percent. 2 c. If the ratio is two-tenths of one percent to twenty-nine 3 hundredths of one percent, the premium shall be four-tenths of 4 one percent. 5 d. If the ratio is three-tenths of one percent to 6 thirty-nine hundredths of one percent, the premium shall be 7 three-tenths of one percent. 8 e. If the ratio is four-tenths of one percent to forty-nine 9 hundredths of one percent, the premium shall be two-tenths of 10 one percent. 11 f. If the ratio is five-tenths of one percent or greater, 12 the premium shall be one-tenth of one percent. 13 8. Beginning January 1, 2031, if the account balance ratio 14 calculated in subsection 7 is below five hundredths of one 15 percent, the director shall assess a solvency surcharge at 16 the lowest rate necessary to provide revenue to pay for the 17 administrative and benefit costs of family leave and medical 18 leave insurance for the calendar year. The solvency surcharge 19 shall be at least one-tenth of one percent and no more than 20 six-tenths of one percent and shall be added to the total 21 premium rate assessed to each employee of a covered employer 22 for family leave and medical leave benefits. 23 9. A covered employer shall collect all required premiums 24 and surcharges from the employerâs employees through payroll 25 deductions and shall remit the amount collected and the amount 26 to be paid by the employer to the department as required by 27 rules adopted by the director. 28 10. On September 30 of each year the department shall 29 average the number of employees reported by an employer over 30 the last four completed calendar quarters to determine the 31 number of employees employed by the employer for the purpose 32 of determining if an employer shall be considered a covered 33 employer for the next calendar year. 34 Sec. 15.

The director of the department of workforce development 20 shall conduct an analysis of the family leave and medical 21 leave insurance program as funded pursuant to section 96A.12, 22 as enacted in this Act, and of the benefits paid pursuant 23 to section 96A.10, as enacted in this Act. The director 24 shall determine if the premium rates and benefit levels are 25 appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the 26 family leave and medical leave insurance account. 27 2. The director shall submit the directorâs findings to 28 the general assembly pursuant to section 7A.11 no later than 29 January 12, 2026. 30 EXPLANATION 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 32 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 33 This bill relates to a family leave and medical leave 34 insurance program (program), administered by the director of 35 -19- LSB 1696XS (5) 91 je/js 19/ 24 S.F. 109 the department of workforce development, that provides for 1 paid, job-protected leave for certain family leave and medical 2 leave reasons for eligible employees of specified employers. 3 An employee is eligible for family leave and medical leave 4 after working for a covered employer, as defined in the bill, 5 for a minimum of 12 consecutive months and a minimum of 1,250 6 hours during the 12 consecutive-month period immediately 7 preceding the employeeâs request for leave. âFamily leaveâ and 8 âmedical leaveâ are defined in the bill. Family leave includes 9 leave to care for an immediate family member with a serious 10 health condition, to bond with a newborn child or adopted or 11 foster child, or for a qualifying exigency for a family member 12 as permitted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 13 1993, as amended (FMLA). Medical leave includes leave due to 14 the employeeâs own serious health condition. âSerious health 15 conditionâ is defined in the bill. 16 The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive 17 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave, 18 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined 19 consecutive 12-month period. The defined consecutive 12-month 20 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement 21 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible 22 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes 23 either family leave or medical leave. The minimum duration of 24 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours. 25 The bill disqualifies an employee from family leave and 26 medical leave benefits under circumstances detailed in the 27 bill. 28 An employee must provide a minimum of 30 daysâ notice 29 to an employer of the employeeâs intent to take leave. If 30 circumstances require an employeeâs leave to begin in less 31 than 30 days, the employee must give as much notice as is 32 practicable. If an eligible employee requests medical leave 33 or family leave, the employee must make a reasonable effort to 34 schedule their own, or their family memberâs, medical treatment 35 -20- LSB 1696XS (5) 91 je/js 20/ 24 S.F. 109 to not unduly disrupt the employerâs operations. 1 The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim 2 for benefits as required by the director. The employee 3 must consent to the disclosure of private or confidential 4 information to and from the department, and the employeeâs 5 employer, for administration of the leave. The bill specifies 6 that such information is not a public record pursuant to Code 7 section 22.1. The employee must attest that the employee has 8 provided notice of intent to take leave to the employeeâs 9 employer. The employee must also authorize the employeeâs, 10 or the employeeâs family memberâs health care provider, to 11 complete a certification of a serious health condition. 12 The bill provides for a seven-day waiting period before 13 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for benefits 14 for leave for the birth of a child or placement of a child for 15 adoption or foster care. 16 The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family 17 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employeeâs weekly 18 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit 19 amount payable to an employee is detailed in the bill. 20 The department must send the first benefit payment to an 21 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed 22 weekly claim for benefits is received by the department. If 23 the employee continues to submit a properly completed weekly 24 claim, subsequent payments are to be made at least biweekly. 25 If an employer, or the department, contests an employeeâs 26 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional 27 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if 28 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible for 29 the benefits. 30 The bill provides that the program shall be funded via 31 employee and employer contributions. Beginning on January 1, 32 2029, and ending on December 31, 2030, the department must 33 assess a covered employer a premium rate of four-tenths of one 34 percent of an employeeâs weekly wages, subject to a maximum as 35 -21- LSB 1696XS (5) 91 je/js 21/ 24 S.F. 109 determined by the director based on the maximum wages subject 1 to taxation for social security. One-third of the premium 2 is to be used to fund family leave insurance benefits and 3 two-thirds of the premium is to be used to fund medical leave 4 benefits. A covered employer may deduct up to 45 percent of 5 the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the family leave 6 premium from an employeeâs wage. The employer must pay the 7 remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and family 8 leave premiums, and may elect to pay all or any portion of its 9 employeesâ share of such premiums. Beginning January 1, 2031, 10 the premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on 11 the family leave and medical leave insurance account balance 12 ratio as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The 13 premium rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed 14 in the bill. 15 On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the 16 department to average the number of employees reported by an 17 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to 18 determine if the employer is a covered employer for the next 19 calendar year. 20 The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed 21 premiums and surcharges from the employerâs employees through 22 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department 23 as required by the director. 24 An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a 25 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically 26 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for 27 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12-month period. If 28 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within 29 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all 30 premiums that should have been collected. 31 Self-employed persons may elect to participate in the 32 program as detailed in the bill. 33 An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave 34 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not 35 -22- LSB 1696XS (5) 91 je/js 22/ 24 S.F. 109 greater than that provided by FMLA. The bill provides that if 1 required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing 2 health benefits during an employeeâs leave. If the employer 3 and employee normally share the cost of such, the employee is 4 responsible for paying the employeeâs share of the costs. 5 A covered employer must submit reports as required by the 6 director and maintain employment records for each employee 7 from which the director may obtain information related to an 8 employeeâs leave. Such records must be maintained for 10 9 years. 10 The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall 11 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law 12 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or 13 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave 14 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave 15 taken under FMLA. A covered employer may allow an employee 16 to choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits, or 17 family leave and medical leave benefits. An employee cannot 18 receive family or medical leave benefits at the same time the 19 employee is receiving state or federal unemployment, workersâ 20 compensation, or disability benefits. The bill prohibits 21 discrimination on the basis of any state or federally protected 22 category. 23 The bill requires the director to administer the program and 24 to provide outreach to ensure that employers and employees are 25 aware of the program and the benefits available under such. 26 The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave 27 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the 28 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums 29 collected from employers into such account and the account can 30 only be used for the program as authorized by the director. 31 The bill requires the director to adopt rules to implement 32 and administer the provisions of the bill. The director may 33 take any action under the directorâs authority to enforce 34 compliance with the bill. 35 -23- LSB 1696XS (5) 91 je/js 23/ 24 S.F. 109 The director is required to analyze the funding of the 1 program and the benefits payable from the programâs account. 2 The director shall determine if the premium rates and the 3 benefit levels are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the 4 solvency of the program. The director must submit the findings 5 to the general assembly no later than January 12, 2026. 6 -24- LSB 1696XS (5) 91 je/js 24/ 24

Disclosure of such information and records by 8 another state agency or an employer to the department shall 9 be solely for purposes related to the administration of this 10 chapter. Information and records disclosed by an employee 11 under this chapter shall not be public records as defined in 12 section 22.1. 13 4. The employee authorizes the health care provider of the 14 employeeâs family member or of the employee, as applicable, to 15 complete a certification of a serious health condition in a 16 form as required by the director. 17 5.

NEW SECTION . 96A.9 Waiting period for leave 22 benefits. 23 Family leave or medical leave insurance benefits shall be 24 payable to an eligible employee following a waiting period 25 consisting of the first seven calendar days of the employeeâs 26 leave. However, no such waiting period applies to a leave for 27 the birth or placement of a child with an eligible employee. 28 Sec. 12. NEW SECTION . 96A.10 Weekly leave benefit amount. 29 1. The basis for the calculation of a leave benefit amount 30 shall be the weekly earnings of an eligible employee on the 31 day the leave is granted. âWeekly earningsâ means the gross 32 earnings of an employee to which the employee would have been 33 entitled had the employee worked the employeeâs customary hours 34 for the full pay period in which the employee is on family 35 -7- LSB 1696XS (5) 91 je/js 7/ 24 S.F. 109 leave or medical leave. Weekly earnings shall be computed as 1 follows, rounded to the nearest dollar, for an employee who is 2 paid on the following basis: 3 a. On a weekly pay period basis, the weekly earnings are the 4 weekly gross earnings. 5 b. On a biweekly pay period basis, the weekly earnings are 6 one-half of the biweekly gross earnings. 7 c. On a semimonthly pay period basis, the weekly earnings 8 are the semimonthly gross earnings multiplied by twenty-four 9 and then divided by fifty-two. 10 d. On a monthly pay period basis, the weekly earnings 11 are the monthly gross earnings multiplied by twelve and then 12 divided by fifty-two. 13 e. On a yearly pay period basis, the weekly earnings shall 14 be the yearly earnings divided by fifty-two. 15 f. On a daily or hourly basis, or by the output of an 16 employee, the weekly earnings shall be computed by dividing by 17 thirteen the earnings, including shift differential pay but 18 not including overtime or premium pay, of the employee earned 19 in the last completed period of thirteen consecutive calendar 20 weeks immediately preceding the start day of the leave. If 21 the employee was absent from employment for personal reasons 22 during part of the thirteen calendar weeks preceding the 23 leave, the employeeâs weekly earnings shall be the amount the 24 employee would have earned had the employee worked when work 25 was available to other employees of the employer in a similar 26 occupation. A week that does not fairly reflect the employeeâs 27 customary earnings shall be replaced by the closest previous 28 week with earnings that fairly represent the employeeâs 29 customary earnings. 30 2. If on the date that an employeeâs leave begins the 31 employeeâs hourly earnings cannot be ascertained, the earnings 32 for the purpose of calculating the benefit amount shall be the 33 usual earnings for similar services where such services are 34 rendered by paid employees. 35 -8- LSB 1696XS (5) 91 je/js 8/ 24 S.F. 109 3. If an employee earns either no wages, or less than the 1 usual weekly earnings of a regular full-time adult laborer 2 in the line of work in which the employee is working in that 3 locality, the weekly earnings shall be one-fiftieth of the 4 total earnings that the employee has earned from all employment 5 during the twelve consecutive calendar months immediately 6 preceding the date that the employeeâs leave begins. 7 4. The weekly leave benefit amount payable to an employee 8 for any one week shall be eighty percent of the employeeâs 9 spendable weekly earnings, but shall not exceed an amount equal 10 to two hundred percent of the statewide average weekly wage 11 as calculated by the department pursuant to section 96.1A and 12 in effect on the date that the employeeâs leave commences. 13 However, the weekly leave benefit amount shall be a minimum 14 equal to the lesser of the weekly leave benefit amount of a 15 person whose gross weekly earnings are thirty-five percent of 16 the statewide average weekly wage, or to the spendable weekly 17 earnings of the employee. 18 Sec. 13. NEW SECTION . 96A.11 Payment of benefits to an 19 eligible employee. 20 1. The department shall send the first benefit payment to 21 an employee within ten calendar days after the first properly 22 completed weekly claim from the employee is received by 23 the department. Subsequent payments shall be sent at least 24 biweekly to an eligible employee if a properly completed weekly 25 claim from the employee is received by the department. 26 2. If an employer contests an employeeâs initial claim 27 for family leave or medical leave benefits, the employer must 28 notify the employee and the department in the manner prescribed 29 by the director within ten calendar days of the employerâs 30 receipt of notice from the department of the employeeâs filing 31 of a claim for benefits pursuant to section 96A.21, subsection 32 3. Failure to timely contest an initial application shall 33 constitute a waiver of objection to the family leave or medical 34 leave claim. 35 -9- LSB 1696XS (5) 91 je/js 9/ 24 S.F. 109 3. If the department or the employeeâs employer contests 1 an employeeâs eligibility for benefits after the employee 2 begins receiving benefits, the employee shall continue to 3 be paid benefits conditionally for any weeks for which the 4 employee files a claim for benefits. The employeeâs right to 5 retain such benefit payments shall be conditioned upon the 6 departmentâs finding that the employee is eligible for such 7 benefit payments. 8 a. At an employeeâs request, the department shall hold 9 conditional benefit payments until the department resolves the 10 employeeâs eligibility status. 11 b. Payment shall be issued promptly for any withheld benefit 12 payments if the department determines that an employee is 13 eligible for benefits. 14 c. If the department determines that an employee is 15 ineligible for the conditionally paid benefits, the employee 16 shall repay the overpayment per rules adopted by the director. 17 Sec. 14.

The premium rate for family leave benefits shall be equal 25 to one-third of the total premium rate. 26 b. The premium rate for medical leave benefits shall be 27 equal to two-thirds of the total premium rate. 28 2. For calendar year 2031 and subsequent calendar years the 29 director shall determine the percentage of paid claims related 30 to family leave benefits and the percentage of paid claims 31 related to medical leave benefits and adjust the premium rates 32 set in subsection 1 by the proportional share of claims paid 33 for both types of leave. 34 3. For family leave premiums a covered employer may deduct 35 -10- LSB 1696XS (5) 91 je/js 10/ 24 S.F. 109 up to forty-five percent of the full amount of the required 1 premiums from the wages of each employee. The remaining 2 fifty-five percent of the required premiums shall be paid by 3 the covered employer. 4 4. For medical leave premiums a covered employer may deduct 5 up to forty-five percent of the full amount of the required 6 premiums from the wages of each employee. The remaining 7 fifty-five percent of the required premiums shall be paid by 8 the covered employer. 9 5. A covered employer may elect to pay all or any portion of 10 its employeesâ share of the premiums for family leave benefits 11 or medical leave benefits or both. 12 6. The director shall annually set a maximum limit on the 13 amount of an employeeâs wages that are subject to a premium 14 assessment under this section that is equal to the contribution 15 and benefit base for the calendar year as determined by the 16 United States social security administration for purposes of 17 26 U.S.C. Â§3121(a). 18 7. For calendar year 2031 and subsequent calendar years, 19 the total premium rate shall be based on the family leave and 20 medical leave insurance account balance ratio as of September 21 30 of the previous year. The director shall calculate the 22 account balance ratio by dividing the balance of the family 23 leave and medical leave insurance account by the total wages 24 paid by covered employers. The division shall be carried 25 to the fourth decimal place with the remaining fraction 26 disregarded unless it amounts to five hundred thousandths or 27 more in which case the fourth decimal place shall be rounded 28 to the next higher digit. If the family leave and medical 29 leave insurance account balance ratio is any of the following 30 percentages, the premium shall be the following percentage of 31 an employeeâs wages subject to a premium assessment: 32 a. If the ratio is zero to nine hundredths of one percent, 33 the premium shall be six-tenths of one percent. 34 b. If the ratio is one-tenth of one percent to nineteen 35 -11- LSB 1696XS (5) 91 je/js 11/ 24 S.F. 109 hundredths of one percent, the premium shall be five-tenths of 1 one percent. 2 c. If the ratio is two-tenths of one percent to twenty-nine 3 hundredths of one percent, the premium shall be four-tenths of 4 one percent. 5 d. If the ratio is three-tenths of one percent to 6 thirty-nine hundredths of one percent, the premium shall be 7 three-tenths of one percent. 8 e. If the ratio is four-tenths of one percent to forty-nine 9 hundredths of one percent, the premium shall be two-tenths of 10 one percent. 11 f. If the ratio is five-tenths of one percent or greater, 12 the premium shall be one-tenth of one percent. 13 8. Beginning January 1, 2031, if the account balance ratio 14 calculated in subsection 7 is below five hundredths of one 15 percent, the director shall assess a solvency surcharge at 16 the lowest rate necessary to provide revenue to pay for the 17 administrative and benefit costs of family leave and medical 18 leave insurance for the calendar year. The solvency surcharge 19 shall be at least one-tenth of one percent and no more than 20 six-tenths of one percent and shall be added to the total 21 premium rate assessed to each employee of a covered employer 22 for family leave and medical leave benefits. 23 9. A covered employer shall collect all required premiums 24 and surcharges from the employerâs employees through payroll 25 deductions and shall remit the amount collected and the amount 26 to be paid by the employer to the department as required by 27 rules adopted by the director. 28 10. On September 30 of each year the department shall 29 average the number of employees reported by an employer over 30 the last four completed calendar quarters to determine the 31 number of employees employed by the employer for the purpose 32 of determining if an employer shall be considered a covered 33 employer for the next calendar year. 34 Sec. 15.

DIRECTOR ANALYSIS OF FUNDING THE FAMILY LEAVE 17 AND MEDICAL LEAVE INSURANCE PROGRAM AND REPORT TO THE GENERAL 18 ASSEMBLY. 19 1. The director of the department of workforce development 20 shall conduct an analysis of the family leave and medical 21 leave insurance program as funded pursuant to section 96A.12, 22 as enacted in this Act, and of the benefits paid pursuant 23 to section 96A.10, as enacted in this Act. The director 24 shall determine if the premium rates and benefit levels are 25 appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the 26 family leave and medical leave insurance account. 27 2. The director shall submit the directorâs findings to 28 the general assembly pursuant to section 7A.11 no later than 29 January 12, 2026. 30 EXPLANATION 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 32 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 33 This bill relates to a family leave and medical leave 34 insurance program (program), administered by the director of 35 -19- LSB 1696XS (5) 91 je/js 19/ 24 S.F. 109 the department of workforce development, that provides for 1 paid, job-protected leave for certain family leave and medical 2 leave reasons for eligible employees of specified employers. 3 An employee is eligible for family leave and medical leave 4 after working for a covered employer, as defined in the bill, 5 for a minimum of 12 consecutive months and a minimum of 1,250 6 hours during the 12 consecutive-month period immediately 7 preceding the employeeâs request for leave. âFamily leaveâ and 8 âmedical leaveâ are defined in the bill. Family leave includes 9 leave to care for an immediate family member with a serious 10 health condition, to bond with a newborn child or adopted or 11 foster child, or for a qualifying exigency for a family member 12 as permitted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 13 1993, as amended (FMLA). Medical leave includes leave due to 14 the employeeâs own serious health condition. âSerious health 15 conditionâ is defined in the bill. 16 The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive 17 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave, 18 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined 19 consecutive 12-month period. The defined consecutive 12-month 20 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement 21 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible 22 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes 23 either family leave or medical leave. The minimum duration of 24 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours. 25 The bill disqualifies an employee from family leave and 26 medical leave benefits under circumstances detailed in the 27 bill. 28 An employee must provide a minimum of 30 daysâ notice 29 to an employer of the employeeâs intent to take leave. If 30 circumstances require an employeeâs leave to begin in less 31 than 30 days, the employee must give as much notice as is 32 practicable. If an eligible employee requests medical leave 33 or family leave, the employee must make a reasonable effort to 34 schedule their own, or their family memberâs, medical treatment 35 -20- LSB 1696XS (5) 91 je/js 20/ 24 S.F. 109 to not unduly disrupt the employerâs operations. 1 The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim 2 for benefits as required by the director. The employee 3 must consent to the disclosure of private or confidential 4 information to and from the department, and the employeeâs 5 employer, for administration of the leave. The bill specifies 6 that such information is not a public record pursuant to Code 7 section 22.1. The employee must attest that the employee has 8 provided notice of intent to take leave to the employeeâs 9 employer. The employee must also authorize the employeeâs, 10 or the employeeâs family memberâs health care provider, to 11 complete a certification of a serious health condition. 12 The bill provides for a seven-day waiting period before 13 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for benefits 14 for leave for the birth of a child or placement of a child for 15 adoption or foster care. 16 The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family 17 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employeeâs weekly 18 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit 19 amount payable to an employee is detailed in the bill. 20 The department must send the first benefit payment to an 21 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed 22 weekly claim for benefits is received by the department. If 23 the employee continues to submit a properly completed weekly 24 claim, subsequent payments are to be made at least biweekly. 25 If an employer, or the department, contests an employeeâs 26 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional 27 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if 28 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible for 29 the benefits. 30 The bill provides that the program shall be funded via 31 employee and employer contributions. Beginning on January 1, 32 2029, and ending on December 31, 2030, the department must 33 assess a covered employer a premium rate of four-tenths of one 34 percent of an employeeâs weekly wages, subject to a maximum as 35 -21- LSB 1696XS (5) 91 je/js 21/ 24 S.F. 109 determined by the director based on the maximum wages subject 1 to taxation for social security. One-third of the premium 2 is to be used to fund family leave insurance benefits and 3 two-thirds of the premium is to be used to fund medical leave 4 benefits.
