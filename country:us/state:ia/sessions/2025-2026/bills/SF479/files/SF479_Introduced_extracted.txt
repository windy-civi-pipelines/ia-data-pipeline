This bill amends current and enacts new 8 provisions relating to a number of different types of business 9 organizations (entities) existing on a for-profit, cooperative, 10 or nonprofit basis. An entity may be formed in this state as 11 a domestic entity or formed in another jurisdiction and doing 12 business in this state as a foreign entity. Generally, an 13 entity is recognized as a person operating in this state with 14 each type of entity governed under its own Code chapter. The 15 relevant chapters, other than for cooperative associations, 16 are based on model legislation prepared by the American bar 17 association. 18 BACKGROUND ââ ORGANIZATION. The bill is comprised of a 19 number of divisions, including a division amending a chapter 20 establishing the office of secretary of state (SOS) and vesting 21 the SOS with powers and duties (Code chapter 9). The other 22 divisions address specific types of entities. A profit entity 23 includes either a partnership, including a limited liability 24 partnership, or a foreign limited liability partnership (Code 25 chapter 486A); either a limited partnership, including a 26 limited liability limited partnership, or a foreign limited 27 partnership, including a foreign limited liability limited 28 partnership (Code chapter 488); either a limited liability 29 company, including a professional limited liability company, 30 or a registered foreign limited liability company (Code 31 chapter 489); either a corporation or foreign corporation (Code 32 chapter 490), including a professional corporation or foreign 33 professional corporation (Code chapter (496C). An entity 34 formed on a cooperative basis includes either an association, 35 -46- LSB 1713XS (2) 91 da/jh 46/ 50 S.F. 479 foreign association (Code chapter 499), or a cooperative 1 association (Code chapter 501); and either a cooperative or 2 foreign cooperative (Code chapter 501A). An entity organized on 3 a nonprofit basis includes either a corporation or a foreign 4 corporation (Code chapter 504). 5 BACKGROUND ââ OPERATIONS. Each type of entity recognizes 6 one or more executives making managerial decisions and equity 7 holders, many of whom are voters making fundamental decisions 8 affecting the entity. Depending upon an entityâs type, an 9 executive may be referred to as a partner (Code chapter 486A), 10 general partner (Code chapter 486A or 488), manager (Code 11 chapter 489), or director (Code chapter 490, 499, 501, 501A, or 12 504). An equity holder may be referred to as a partner (Code 13 chapter 486A), limited partner (Code chapter 486A or 488), 14 shareholder (Code chapter 490), or member (Code chapter 489, 15 499, 501, 501A, or 504). Generally, an entityâs executives and 16 equity holders are shielded from personal liability for actions 17 attributable to the entity. The entity and its equity holders 18 may also be subject to special tax treatment. 19 BACKGROUND ââ DOCUMENTS. Each entity is placed under the 20 general authority of the SOS and in order to be recognized or 21 authorized to carry out certain functions in this state, an 22 entity must file a number of designated documents (referred to 23 as records in Code chapters 488 and 489). The SOSâs function 24 is to file a document as a ministerial act (Code sections 25 486A.1205, 488.206, 489.210, 490.125, 501A.202, and 504.116). 26 Two Code chapters do not so prescribe the SOSâs authority 27 when filing a document (Code chapters 499 and 501). A number 28 of Code chapters do provide that the SOS may refuse to file 29 a document submitted by an entity (Code sections 486A.1205, 30 488.206, 489.210, 490.125, 501A.202, and 504.116). Two Code 31 chapters do not provide the SOS with that authority (Code 32 chapters 499 and 501). Other Code chapters that provide 33 the SOS authority to refuse a filing provide that an entity 34 may appeal the SOS decision with the district court (Code 35 -47- LSB 1713XS (2) 91 da/jh 47/ 50 S.F. 479 sections 486A.1206, 489.210, 490.126, 501A.207, and 504.117). 1 One chapter provides for the right by the SOS to refuse a 2 filing but not a right of appeal (Code chapter 488). Two Code 3 chapters provide for neither a right by the SOS to refuse a 4 filing nor consequently the right of appeal by the entity (Code 5 chapters 499 and 501). 6 BACKGROUND ââ REGISTERED FILINGS. Each entity must file 7 with the SOS certain documents referred to in the bill as a 8 registered filing that includes the name and address of a 9 registered agent and registered office for acceptance of legal 10 notices including service of process (Code sections 486A.1211, 11 488.114, 489.115, 490.501, 499.72, 501.106, 501A.401, and 12 504.501) in addition to a registered agent and registered 13 office, the registered filing must include the entityâs 14 principal (or executive) office. The failure to keep current 15 registered filing is grounds for administrative dissolution 16 (Code sections 488.809, 489.708, 490.1420, 499.76, 501.811, and 17 504.1421). Generally, a filer who has included an incorrect 18 statement in a filed document may correct the statement 19 (Code sections 486A.1204, 488.207, 489.209, 490.124, 501.105, 20 501A.204, and 504.115). 21 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ SECRETARY OF STATEâS AUTHORITY TO 22 FILE DOCUMENTS. The bill makes changes to each of the Code 23 chapters beginning with Code chapter 9 by amending provisions 24 by correcting citations or enhancing readability. 25 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ REFUSAL TO FILE A DOCUMENT. The bill 26 provides that when filing a document by an association or 27 foreign association under Code chapter 499 or a cooperative 28 under Code chapter 501, the entity and SOS are subject to 29 the same filing requirements as other entities. Under the 30 bill, the SOSâs filing of a document is also ministerial 31 (Code sections 499.44 and 501.105). The bill provides that 32 the SOS may refuse to file such a document (Code sections 33 499.44 and 501.105). The bill provides an appeal process 34 from a decision by the SOS not to file a document submitted 35 -48- LSB 1713XS (2) 91 da/jh 48/ 50 S.F. 479 by a limited partnership or foreign limited partnership (Code 1 section 488.206B), an association (Code section 499.44B), or 2 a cooperative (Code section 501.105B). The bill includes a 3 number of new provisions applicable to all entities, including 4 a requirement that the SOS must refuse to file a document, 5 if the SOS determines that the document is materially false 6 or fraudulent or the document may be used to accomplish a 7 fraudulent, criminal, or otherwise unlawful purpose (Code 8 sections 486A.1205, 488.206, 489.210, 490.125, 499.44, 501.105, 9 501A.202, and 504.116). 10 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ NOTARIZED AFFIDAVIT TO REMOVE 11 UNAUTHORIZED USE INFORMATION FROM A REGISTERED FILING. 12 The bill provides for unauthorized use information that 13 misidentifies a registered agent, registered office, or 14 principle office in a registered filing (Code sections 15 486A.1206B, 488.206C, 489.210B, 490.126B, 499.44D, 501.105D, 16 501A.202B, and 504.117B). A person whose information has 17 been misidentified in a registered filing may submit to the 18 SOS a notarized affidavit to remove such information from 19 a registered filing (affidavit). The SOS must conduct an 20 administrative review of the affidavit to determine the 21 whether an asserted allegation is true. The SOS may reject an 22 affidavit after determining that it is illegible, incomplete, 23 misleading, or includes factual errors; or its purpose is to 24 defraud or harass a person, including the filer. 25 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ STATEMENT TO REMOVE UNAUTHORIZED USE 26 INFORMATION FROM A REGISTERED FILING. If the SOS determines 27 that an allegation of an affidavit is true, the SOS must file a 28 statement to remove unauthorized use information (statement) 29 and must then remove the unauthorized use information from 30 the registered filings (Code sections 486A.1206C, 488.206D, 31 489.210C, 490.126C, 499.44E, 501.105E, 501A.202C, and 32 504.117C). The SOS must also deliver a notice of the statement 33 to the entity explaining what information was removed and why 34 it was removed. The SOS may allow the entity to correct the 35 -49- LSB 1713XS (2) 91 da/jh 49/ 50 S.F. 479 registered filing. The SOS is prohibited from charging a fee 1 for accepting or reviewing an affidavit, filing a statement, 2 or removing unauthorized use information from any registered 3 filing. The SOS cannot return a fee paid for a registered 4 filing. The SOS may act as an agent of the entity and the 5 office of the SOS may act as the registered office of the 6 entity. 7 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ STATEMENT TO REMOVE UNAUTHORIZED USE 8 INFORMATION FROM A REGISTERED FILING ââ REGISTERED AGENT AND 9 OFFICE. If the SOSâs removal of unauthorized use information 10 from a registered filing would prohibit a person from serving 11 any process, notice, or demand required or permitted by 12 law, the SOS acts as the registered agent, and the SOSâs 13 office acts as the registered office for the entity until the 14 registered agent or registered office is changed (Code sections 15 486A.1214A, 488.117B, 489.119A, 490.504A, 499.75A, 501.106A, 16 501A.403A, and 504.504A). 17 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ APPEAL OF STATEMENT TO REMOVE 18 UNAUTHORIZED USE INFORMATION FROM A REGISTERED FILING. An 19 entity is entitled to appeal a decision by the SOS to file 20 a statement removing unauthorized use information from a 21 registered filing in a similar manner as an entity may appeal a 22 decision by the SOS refusing to file a document (Code sections 23 486A.1206D, 488.206E, 489.210D, 490.126D, 499.44F, 501.105F, 24 501A.202D, and 504.117D). 25 -50- LSB 1713XS (2) 91 da/jh 50/ 50

This bill amends current and enacts new 8 provisions relating to a number of different types of business 9 organizations (entities) existing on a for-profit, cooperative, 10 or nonprofit basis. An entity may be formed in this state as 11 a domestic entity or formed in another jurisdiction and doing 12 business in this state as a foreign entity. Generally, an 13 entity is recognized as a person operating in this state with 14 each type of entity governed under its own Code chapter. The 15 relevant chapters, other than for cooperative associations, 16 are based on model legislation prepared by the American bar 17 association. 18 BACKGROUND ââ ORGANIZATION. The bill is comprised of a 19 number of divisions, including a division amending a chapter 20 establishing the office of secretary of state (SOS) and vesting 21 the SOS with powers and duties (Code chapter 9). The other 22 divisions address specific types of entities. A profit entity 23 includes either a partnership, including a limited liability 24 partnership, or a foreign limited liability partnership (Code 25 chapter 486A); either a limited partnership, including a 26 limited liability limited partnership, or a foreign limited 27 partnership, including a foreign limited liability limited 28 partnership (Code chapter 488); either a limited liability 29 company, including a professional limited liability company, 30 or a registered foreign limited liability company (Code 31 chapter 489); either a corporation or foreign corporation (Code 32 chapter 490), including a professional corporation or foreign 33 professional corporation (Code chapter (496C). An entity 34 formed on a cooperative basis includes either an association, 35 -46- LSB 1713XS (2) 91 da/jh 46/ 50 S.F. 479 foreign association (Code chapter 499), or a cooperative 1 association (Code chapter 501); and either a cooperative or 2 foreign cooperative (Code chapter 501A). An entity organized on 3 a nonprofit basis includes either a corporation or a foreign 4 corporation (Code chapter 504). 5 BACKGROUND ââ OPERATIONS. Each type of entity recognizes 6 one or more executives making managerial decisions and equity 7 holders, many of whom are voters making fundamental decisions 8 affecting the entity. Depending upon an entityâs type, an 9 executive may be referred to as a partner (Code chapter 486A), 10 general partner (Code chapter 486A or 488), manager (Code 11 chapter 489), or director (Code chapter 490, 499, 501, 501A, or 12 504). An equity holder may be referred to as a partner (Code 13 chapter 486A), limited partner (Code chapter 486A or 488), 14 shareholder (Code chapter 490), or member (Code chapter 489, 15 499, 501, 501A, or 504). Generally, an entityâs executives and 16 equity holders are shielded from personal liability for actions 17 attributable to the entity. The entity and its equity holders 18 may also be subject to special tax treatment. 19 BACKGROUND ââ DOCUMENTS. Each entity is placed under the 20 general authority of the SOS and in order to be recognized or 21 authorized to carry out certain functions in this state, an 22 entity must file a number of designated documents (referred to 23 as records in Code chapters 488 and 489). The SOSâs function 24 is to file a document as a ministerial act (Code sections 25 486A.1205, 488.206, 489.210, 490.125, 501A.202, and 504.116). 26 Two Code chapters do not so prescribe the SOSâs authority 27 when filing a document (Code chapters 499 and 501). A number 28 of Code chapters do provide that the SOS may refuse to file 29 a document submitted by an entity (Code sections 486A.1205, 30 488.206, 489.210, 490.125, 501A.202, and 504.116). Two Code 31 chapters do not provide the SOS with that authority (Code 32 chapters 499 and 501). Other Code chapters that provide 33 the SOS authority to refuse a filing provide that an entity 34 may appeal the SOS decision with the district court (Code 35 -47- LSB 1713XS (2) 91 da/jh 47/ 50 S.F. 479 sections 486A.1206, 489.210, 490.126, 501A.207, and 504.117). 1 One chapter provides for the right by the SOS to refuse a 2 filing but not a right of appeal (Code chapter 488). Two Code 3 chapters provide for neither a right by the SOS to refuse a 4 filing nor consequently the right of appeal by the entity (Code 5 chapters 499 and 501). 6 BACKGROUND ââ REGISTERED FILINGS. Each entity must file 7 with the SOS certain documents referred to in the bill as a 8 registered filing that includes the name and address of a 9 registered agent and registered office for acceptance of legal 10 notices including service of process (Code sections 486A.1211, 11 488.114, 489.115, 490.501, 499.72, 501.106, 501A.401, and 12 504.501) in addition to a registered agent and registered 13 office, the registered filing must include the entityâs 14 principal (or executive) office. The failure to keep current 15 registered filing is grounds for administrative dissolution 16 (Code sections 488.809, 489.708, 490.1420, 499.76, 501.811, and 17 504.1421). Generally, a filer who has included an incorrect 18 statement in a filed document may correct the statement 19 (Code sections 486A.1204, 488.207, 489.209, 490.124, 501.105, 20 501A.204, and 504.115). 21 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ SECRETARY OF STATEâS AUTHORITY TO 22 FILE DOCUMENTS. The bill makes changes to each of the Code 23 chapters beginning with Code chapter 9 by amending provisions 24 by correcting citations or enhancing readability. 25 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ REFUSAL TO FILE A DOCUMENT. The bill 26 provides that when filing a document by an association or 27 foreign association under Code chapter 499 or a cooperative 28 under Code chapter 501, the entity and SOS are subject to 29 the same filing requirements as other entities. Under the 30 bill, the SOSâs filing of a document is also ministerial 31 (Code sections 499.44 and 501.105).
