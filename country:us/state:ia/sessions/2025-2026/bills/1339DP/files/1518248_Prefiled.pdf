1 librarian, the bill also strikes a corresponding provision

8 for DAS as part of DAS’s library services.
9 The bill strikes DAS’s obligation to establish and
10 administer standards for state agency libraries.
11 The bill eliminates a reference to “access plus programs”
12 of public libraries for purposes of DAS’s duty to support such
13 programs under the enrich Iowa program, and substitutes the
14 term “interlibrary loan programs” for such purposes.
