This bill amends the âUniform 27 Partnership Actâ (Code chapter 486A) prepared and recommended 28 by the national conference of commissioners of uniform state 29 laws, and providing for partnership law in Iowa. A partnership 30 refers to a general partnership which involves an association 31 of individuals who assume co-ownership of business assets. 32 Generally, the general partners are responsible for collective 33 decisionmaking, taking an equal share of business profits, 34 and assuming full personal liability in case of a lawsuit or 35 -7- LSB 1684YC (3) 91 da/jh 7/ 10 H.F. _____ creditor action. A partnership is governed by a partnership 1 agreement which is a type of private contract entered into 2 by the partners that describes the internal affairs of 3 the organization, and is not required to be filed with the 4 secretary of state. 5 TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS. A partnership is often compared 6 with other types of organizations that limit the income earned 7 and liability incurred by investors based on their respective 8 contributions. The organization may delegate control over the 9 organizationâs affairs to one or more persons who serve in a 10 fiduciary capacity as one or more general partners of a limited 11 partnership (Code chapter 488), managers of a limited liability 12 company (Code chapter 489), or board members of a business 13 corporation (Code chapter 490) or nonprofit corporation 14 (Code chapter 504). These types of filing organizations 15 must be formed under what the bill refers to as a domestic 16 governing statute or foreign governing statute that controls 17 the organizationâs internal governance with certain tax 18 consequences. A foreign organization may also include other 19 types of organizations under a comparable foreign governing 20 statute. A public organic document required to be filed to 21 form a domestic organization includes a certificate of limited 22 partnership for a domestic limited partnership, a certificate 23 of organization for a domestic limited liability company, 24 articles of incorporation for a domestic business corporation 25 or not-for-profit corporation. An organizational document 26 includes a public organic document and other documents not 27 required to be filed, including a partnership agreement for a 28 domestic partnership, an operating agreement for a domestic 29 limited liability company, bylaws and shareholder agreements 30 for a domestic business corporation, and bylaws and other 31 member agreements for a nonprofit corporation. 32 BACKGROUND ââ CONVERSION. The process of conversion allows 33 a domestic organization to become another type of domestic or 34 foreign organization. Under Code chapter 486A, the conversion 35 -8- LSB 1684YC (3) 91 da/jh 8/ 10 H.F. _____ process is limited. A domestic partnership formed under 1 Code chapter 486A may only convert to a limited partnership 2 governed under Code chapter 488 and only pursuant to certain 3 requirements. The terms of the conversion must be approved 4 by the partners. After the conversion, the converted limited 5 partnership must file a certificate of limited partnership 6 with the secretary. A general partner which becomes a limited 7 partner of a converted limited partnership must remain liable 8 as a general partner for any liability for an obligation 9 incurred by the partnership. 10 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ PROCESS OF CONVERSION. The bill 11 provides for the conversion of a domestic partnership to a 12 domestic limited partnership or any other type of domestic 13 or foreign organization, so long as the other organizationâs 14 governing statute authorizes the conversion, the conversion 15 is not prohibited by the other organizationâs governing 16 statute, and the other organization complies with its governing 17 statute. The terms of the conversion must be set out in 18 a plan of conversion for approval by all of the general 19 partnershipâs partners or a percentage specified in its 20 partnership agreement. The plan of conversion must include 21 organizational documents of the converted organization. After 22 the conversion is approved, the secretary of state must 23 file articles of conversion with the secretary of state that 24 includes information regarding the converting partnership and 25 converted organization. The conversion takes effect when 26 articles of conversion and any public organic record for the 27 converted organization are filed, or a later date as specified 28 in the filed articles. The bill retains a provision that holds 29 a general partner liable for any obligation incurred by the 30 partnership before the conversion takes effect. 31 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ EFFECT OF CONVERSION. When a 32 conversion takes effect, property owned by the converting 33 organization becomes property of the converted organization. 34 Obligations, including debts, incurred by the converting 35 -9- LSB 1684YC (3) 91 da/jh 9/ 10 H.F. _____ organization become obligations of the converted organization. 1 Any pending legal action brought by or against the converting 2 organization continues as if the conversion had not occurred. 3 The converted foreign organization consents to the jurisdiction 4 of the courts of this state to enforce any obligation owed by 5 the converting organization. A converted foreign organization 6 that is not authorized to transact business in this state must 7 appoint the secretary of state as its agent for service of 8 process. 9 -10- LSB 1684YC (3) 91 da/jh 10/ 10
