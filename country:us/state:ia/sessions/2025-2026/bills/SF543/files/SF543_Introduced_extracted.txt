Members appointed by 11 the chief judge for the recount of a partisan election shall 12 not be comprised of more than one-third of persons who are not 13 members of either of the two political parties whose candidates 14 for president received the most or next-most votes at the last 15 general election for a partisan election and not more than a 16 simple majority of members appointed by a chief judge shall be 17 from the same political party or organization. 18 The bill allows the state commissioner of elections to call 19 for a recount of any election and to advise election recount 20 boards. 21 The bill removes the first and second Monday after an 22 election as a possible date for canvassing an election. 23 The bill requires a county board of canvassers to order a 24 recount in all election districts in a county for a particular 25 office or nomination if a request for a recount is filed with 26 the commissioner of that county not later than 5:00 p.m. on the 27 second day following the boardâs canvass of the election. The 28 bill requires the state commissioner of elections to order a 29 recount of the votes cast for a statewide office, a seat in 30 the United States Congress, or electors for president or vice 31 president, or nominations for such offices, in each county 32 specified in a written request if the request is filed with the 33 state commissioner not later than 5:00 p.m. on the second day 34 following the county canvass of the election in question. If 35 -15- LSB 1420SV (1) 91 ss/ns 15/ 18 S.F. 543 automatic tabulating equipment was used to tabulate ballots in 1 the precinct, a request for a recount shall indicate whether 2 the recount shall be conducted using only automated tabulating 3 equipment or by hand. The bill requires the candidate to 4 request the same method of recounting in all counties in which 5 the candidate requests a recount. The state commissioner 6 of elections shall assess a civil penalty of $100 against a 7 candidate for each county in which the candidate was required 8 to request a hand recount but did not. The bill requires the 9 penalty to first be deducted from the recount bond paid by the 10 candidate and to be deposited in the general fund of the state. 11 The bill allows a candidate to withdraw a request for a recount 12 within 24 hours of the completion of an administrative audit 13 by a commissioner. 14 The bill requires a recount board to be convened no later 15 than 9:00 a.m. on the sixth day following the canvass of 16 the election. The commissioner shall then inform the board 17 whether the candidate requested a hand recount. The board 18 shall direct the commissioner to retabulate the ballots using 19 the automatic tabulating equipment using the same program as 20 was used to tabulate the votes on election day unless the 21 program is believed or known to be flawed. The board shall 22 recount only the ballots which were voted and counted for 23 the office in question, including disputed ballots. After 24 retabulating, the board shall compare the results to the 25 abstract prepared pursuant to the county boardâs canvass and 26 note any discrepancies. If the candidate requested a hand 27 recount, the bill requires the ballots to be separated into 28 categories and tabulated. The board shall then compare the 29 results of the tabulation to the results of the canvass and the 30 automatic recount. If there are discrepancies, the results of 31 the hand recount shall control. The bill then requires the 32 board to reseal and preserve the ballots. 33 The bill requires an election recount board to file its 34 report by 17 days after the canvass of an election for the 35 -16- LSB 1420SV (1) 91 ss/ns 16/ 18 S.F. 543 offices of president and vice president, by 21 days after the 1 canvass of an election for a state office or a seat in the 2 United States Congress, and by 13 days after the canvass of any 3 other election. The bill also requires a county commissioner 4 of elections to notify the state commissioner when the county 5 commissioner receives a recount request for any office elected 6 by the residents of more than one county. Upon verification 7 that a candidate requested a hand count in at least one but 8 not all counties where a recount was requested, the bill also 9 requires the state commissioner to inform each commissioner 10 of a county where a recount was requested that a hand recount 11 shall be performed. 12 The bill allows a candidate or person who requested a recount 13 to accept the results of the original canvass of the election, 14 which will cause the election recount board to cease its work. 15 The bill requires a petition for a recount of an election 16 for a public measure to be submitted not later than two days 17 following the canvass of the votes for the measure rather 18 than three days. The bill changes the makeup of the recount 19 board for a public measure by removing a designee named by the 20 commissioner and a person jointly selected by that person and 21 a designee named in the petition requesting the recount and 22 replacing them with two election officials selected by the 23 chief judge of the judicial district where the canvass occurs. 24 The commissioner shall convene the recount board not later than 25 9:00 a.m. on the sixth day following the county boardâs canvass 26 of the election in question. 27 Under current law, a county commissioner of elections may 28 conduct an administrative recount if the commissioner suspects 29 that voting equipment used in the election malfunctioned or 30 that programming errors may have affected the outcome of the 31 election, or if the precinct election officials report counting 32 errors to the commissioner. The bill instead allows the county 33 commissioner of elections to conduct an administrative audit if 34 such circumstances exist. The bill allows political parties, 35 -17- LSB 1420SV (1) 91 ss/ns 17/ 18 S.F. 543 as defined in Code, to appoint observers to witness the audit. 1 The bill changes the clerk of a court of contest for 2 presidential electors and congresspersons from the secretary 3 of state to the clerk of the supreme court. If the clerk of 4 the supreme court is absent or unable to act, the secretary of 5 state shall be the clerk of the court. For elections for state 6 officers, the bill changes the clerk of a contest court to the 7 clerk of the supreme court. If the clerk of the supreme court 8 is absent or unable to act, the secretary of state shall be the 9 clerk of the court. However, if the secretary of state is a 10 party to the contest, the auditor of state shall be the clerk 11 of the court. 12 The bill takes effect upon enactment. 13 -18- LSB 1420SV (1) 91 ss/ns 18/ 18

For a county of fewer than 31 15,000, the board shall consist of a designee of the candidate 32 requesting the recount, a designee of the apparent winning 33 candidate, and a person who is a precinct election official 34 selected by the chief judge of the judicial district in which 35 -14- LSB 1420SV (1) 91 ss/ns 14/ 18 S.F. 543 the canvass occurs. For a county with a population between 1 15,000 and 49,999, the board shall consist of a designee of the 2 candidate requesting the recount, a designee of the apparent 3 winning candidate, and three persons who are precinct election 4 officials selected by the chief judge of the judicial district 5 in which the canvass occurs. For a county with a population 6 of 50,000 or greater, the board shall consist of two designees 7 of the candidate requesting the recount, two designees of the 8 apparent winning candidate, and three persons who are precinct 9 election officials selected by the chief judge of the judicial 10 district in which the canvass occurs. Members appointed by 11 the chief judge for the recount of a partisan election shall 12 not be comprised of more than one-third of persons who are not 13 members of either of the two political parties whose candidates 14 for president received the most or next-most votes at the last 15 general election for a partisan election and not more than a 16 simple majority of members appointed by a chief judge shall be 17 from the same political party or organization. 18 The bill allows the state commissioner of elections to call 19 for a recount of any election and to advise election recount 20 boards. 21 The bill removes the first and second Monday after an 22 election as a possible date for canvassing an election. 23 The bill requires a county board of canvassers to order a 24 recount in all election districts in a county for a particular 25 office or nomination if a request for a recount is filed with 26 the commissioner of that county not later than 5:00 p.m. on the 27 second day following the boardâs canvass of the election. The 28 bill requires the state commissioner of elections to order a 29 recount of the votes cast for a statewide office, a seat in 30 the United States Congress, or electors for president or vice 31 president, or nominations for such offices, in each county 32 specified in a written request if the request is filed with the 33 state commissioner not later than 5:00 p.m. on the second day 34 following the county canvass of the election in question. If 35 -15- LSB 1420SV (1) 91 ss/ns 15/ 18 S.F. 543 automatic tabulating equipment was used to tabulate ballots in 1 the precinct, a request for a recount shall indicate whether 2 the recount shall be conducted using only automated tabulating 3 equipment or by hand. The bill requires the candidate to 4 request the same method of recounting in all counties in which 5 the candidate requests a recount. The state commissioner 6 of elections shall assess a civil penalty of $100 against a 7 candidate for each county in which the candidate was required 8 to request a hand recount but did not. The bill requires the 9 penalty to first be deducted from the recount bond paid by the 10 candidate and to be deposited in the general fund of the state. 11 The bill allows a candidate to withdraw a request for a recount 12 within 24 hours of the completion of an administrative audit 13 by a commissioner. 14 The bill requires a recount board to be convened no later 15 than 9:00 a.m. on the sixth day following the canvass of 16 the election. The commissioner shall then inform the board 17 whether the candidate requested a hand recount. The board 18 shall direct the commissioner to retabulate the ballots using 19 the automatic tabulating equipment using the same program as 20 was used to tabulate the votes on election day unless the 21 program is believed or known to be flawed. The board shall 22 recount only the ballots which were voted and counted for 23 the office in question, including disputed ballots. After 24 retabulating, the board shall compare the results to the 25 abstract prepared pursuant to the county boardâs canvass and 26 note any discrepancies. If the candidate requested a hand 27 recount, the bill requires the ballots to be separated into 28 categories and tabulated. The board shall then compare the 29 results of the tabulation to the results of the canvass and the 30 automatic recount. If there are discrepancies, the results of 31 the hand recount shall control. The bill then requires the 32 board to reseal and preserve the ballots. 33 The bill requires an election recount board to file its 34 report by 17 days after the canvass of an election for the 35 -16- LSB 1420SV (1) 91 ss/ns 16/ 18 S.F. 543 offices of president and vice president, by 21 days after the 1 canvass of an election for a state office or a seat in the 2 United States Congress, and by 13 days after the canvass of any 3 other election. The bill also requires a county commissioner 4 of elections to notify the state commissioner when the county 5 commissioner receives a recount request for any office elected 6 by the residents of more than one county. Upon verification 7 that a candidate requested a hand count in at least one but 8 not all counties where a recount was requested, the bill also 9 requires the state commissioner to inform each commissioner 10 of a county where a recount was requested that a hand recount 11 shall be performed. 12 The bill allows a candidate or person who requested a recount 13 to accept the results of the original canvass of the election, 14 which will cause the election recount board to cease its work. 15 The bill requires a petition for a recount of an election 16 for a public measure to be submitted not later than two days 17 following the canvass of the votes for the measure rather 18 than three days. The bill changes the makeup of the recount 19 board for a public measure by removing a designee named by the 20 commissioner and a person jointly selected by that person and 21 a designee named in the petition requesting the recount and 22 replacing them with two election officials selected by the 23 chief judge of the judicial district where the canvass occurs. 24 The commissioner shall convene the recount board not later than 25 9:00 a.m. on the sixth day following the county boardâs canvass 26 of the election in question. 27 Under current law, a county commissioner of elections may 28 conduct an administrative recount if the commissioner suspects 29 that voting equipment used in the election malfunctioned or 30 that programming errors may have affected the outcome of the 31 election, or if the precinct election officials report counting 32 errors to the commissioner. The bill instead allows the county 33 commissioner of elections to conduct an administrative audit if 34 such circumstances exist. The bill allows political parties, 35 -17- LSB 1420SV (1) 91 ss/ns 17/ 18 S.F. 543 as defined in Code, to appoint observers to witness the audit. 1 The bill changes the clerk of a court of contest for 2 presidential electors and congresspersons from the secretary 3 of state to the clerk of the supreme court. If the clerk of 4 the supreme court is absent or unable to act, the secretary of 5 state shall be the clerk of the court. For elections for state 6 officers, the bill changes the clerk of a contest court to the 7 clerk of the supreme court. If the clerk of the supreme court 8 is absent or unable to act, the secretary of state shall be the 9 clerk of the court. However, if the secretary of state is a 10 party to the contest, the auditor of state shall be the clerk 11 of the court. 12 The bill takes effect upon enactment. 13 -18- LSB 1420SV (1) 91 ss/ns 18/ 18
