Under current law, a 22 psychiatric medical institution for children (PMIC) is an 23 institution providing more than 24 hours of continuous care 24 involving long-term psychiatric services to 3 or more children 25 in residence for expected periods of 14 days or more for 26 diagnosis and evaluation, or for expected periods of 90 days 27 or more for treatment. 28 The bill exempts PMICs from licensing requirements for 29 maintaining or conducting programs with the primary purpose 30 of treating and rehabilitating persons with a substance use 31 disorder. 32 The bill defines âapproved qualifying organizationâ as 33 the joint commission, the commission on the accreditation of 34 rehabilitation facilities, the council on accreditation, or a 35 -33- LSB 1457HV (4) 91 dg/ko 33/ 38 H.F. 833 nationally recognized accrediting organization with standards 1 comparable to the joint commission and commission on the 2 accreditation of rehabilitation facilities that are acceptable 3 under federal regulations. 4 The bill defines âmental health disorderâ as a mental 5 disorder as defined in the most recent version of the 6 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published 7 by the American psychiatric association, or a mental disorder 8 as defined in the most recent version of the international 9 classification of diseases published by the world health 10 organization. 11 The bill defines âprotective locked environmentâ as a 12 setting that prevents egress from a building or grounds as a 13 protective measure to ensure safety and security. 14 The bill defines ârecord check evaluation systemâ as the 15 record check evaluation system of HHS used to perform child and 16 dependent adult abuse record checks and to evaluate criminal 17 history and abuse records. 18 The bill defines âserious emotional disturbanceâ as a 19 diagnosable disorder of sufficient duration to meet diagnostic 20 criteria specified within the most current diagnostic and 21 statistical manual of mental disorders published by the 22 American psychiatric association that results in a functional 23 impairment. âSerious emotional disturbanceâ does not include a 24 substance use disorder or developmental disorder unless such 25 disorder co-occurs with such diagnosable mental, behavioral, 26 or emotional disorder. 27 The bill defines âsubstance use disorderâ as a diagnosable 28 substance use disorder of sufficient duration to meet 29 diagnostic criteria specified within the most current 30 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published 31 by the American psychiatric association that results in a 32 functional impairment. 33 The bill defines âyouthâ as a person who is less than 21 34 years of age. 35 -34- LSB 1457HV (4) 91 dg/ko 34/ 38 H.F. 833 The bill describes the nature of care a PMIC must offer youth 1 with a serious emotional disturbance (SED), a substance use 2 disorder (SUD), or both. 3 Under current law, a person who establishes a PMIC must 4 also hold a license under Code chapter 237 (child foster 5 care facilities) as a comprehensive residential facility for 6 children, or hold a license under Code chapter 125 (substance 7 use disorders) if the facility provides SUD treatment. The 8 bill eliminates the requirement that a PMIC holds either 9 of these additional licenses, and instead requires that an 10 applicant for a PMIC license specify whether the applicant will 11 provide SED services, SUD services, or both. A PMIC may only 12 provide services for which it is licensed. 13 The bill eliminates the requirement that a proposed PMIC be 14 under the direction of an agency which has previously operated 15 a facility for children or adolescents and meets or exceeds 16 requirements for licensure as a comprehensive residential 17 facility for children. 18 The bill requires the department of inspections, appeals 19 and licensing (DIAL), in cooperation with the department of 20 health and human services (HHS), to adopt rules relating to the 21 application of a protective locked environment in a PMIC. 22 Under current law, following the hospitalization hearing 23 on an involuntary commitment petition, if the court finds 24 by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent has a 25 serious mental impairment, the court shall order the respondent 26 committed for a complete psychiatric evaluation and appropriate 27 treatment. The chief medical officer (CMO) of the hospital or 28 facility at which a respondent is committed must report to the 29 court no more than 15 days after the date the respondent is 30 placed, making a recommendation for disposition of the matter. 31 The bill allows a court to place a minor respondent in a public 32 hospital and allows a CMO of the hospital no more than 30 33 days after the date the minor respondent is placed to make a 34 recommendation for disposition of the matter. 35 -35- LSB 1457HV (4) 91 dg/ko 35/ 38 H.F. 833 The bill defines âbehavioral health evaluationâ as a 1 comprehensive evaluation of a personâs mental and behavioral 2 health by a person licensed under Code chapter 154B 3 (psychology), 154C (social work), or 154D (behavioral science) 4 for purposes including but not limited to identifying a 5 possible behavioral health condition. 6 The bill defines âphysical assessmentâ as direct physical 7 touching, viewing, and medically necessary manipulation of any 8 area of a childâs body by a licensed physician. 9 The bill replaces several references to a physical or mental 10 examination with references to a physical assessment (PA) or 11 behavioral health evaluation (BHE) and replaces references to a 12 personâs abuse of alcohol or other controlled substances with 13 references to the person having a behavioral health condition. 14 Under current law, one of several specific circumstances 15 must exist before a juvenile court has the authority to enter 16 an ex parte order to direct a peace officer or a juvenile court 17 officer to take custody of a child before or after the filing 18 of a petition under Code chapter 232 (juvenile justice). The 19 bill adds the circumstance when the childâs parent, guardian, 20 or legal custodian consents to the removal as a condition that 21 would permit a juvenile court to enter such an ex parte order. 22 The bill creates similar provisions for when a juvenile court 23 may enter an ex parte order for a child to undergo an inpatient 24 PA or an inpatient BHE and when a person authorized to conduct 25 a preliminary investigation in response to a complaint 26 may motion to ask the court to order a child to undergo an 27 inpatient PA or an inpatient BHE. 28 The bill authorizes a court, after a dispositional hearing, 29 to order a male child in a child in need of assistance (CINA) 30 proceeding or a family in need of assistance (FINA) proceeding 31 to receive an inpatient PA, an inpatient BHE, or both, at the 32 state training school (STS). A request for the use of the STS 33 for purposes of a PA or BHE must be approved by the director of 34 HHS. A child ordered to the STS pursuant to a CINA proceeding 35 -36- LSB 1457HV (4) 91 dg/ko 36/ 38 H.F. 833 or a FINA proceeding must be separated at all times from 1 children placed in the STS pursuant to a juvenile delinquency 2 proceeding. Under current law, the court in a CINA or FINA 3 proceeding is prohibited from placing a child in the STS for 4 any reason. 5 The bill exempts a PMIC from licensing requirements for 6 child foster care. 7 The bill defines âprotective locked environmentâ as a 8 setting that prevents egress from a building or grounds as a 9 protective measure to ensure safety and security. The bill 10 directs HHS and DIAL to adopt rules relating to the application 11 of a protective locked environment to child foster care 12 licensees. 13 The bill directs HHS and DIAL to coordinate in developing 14 rules related to this division of the bill. The bill outlines 15 goals and considerations each department must take into account 16 while adopting such rules. 17 The bill makes conforming changes to Code chapters 135H 18 (psychiatric medical institutions for children) and 232 19 (juvenile justice). The bill repeals 2024 Iowa Acts, chapter 20 1161, sections 97 and 98. 21 DIVISION II ââ HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES ââ 22 HABILITATION SERVICES PROVIDED BY A RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM ââ 23 EXCLUSION FROM CHILDRENâS RESIDENTIAL FACILITY DEFINITION. The 24 bill excludes care furnished to persons 16 years of age or 25 older by certain residential programs detailed in the bill from 26 the definition of a childrenâs residential facility. 27 DIVISION III ââ DIRECTOR OF JUVENILE COURT SERVICES ââ 28 CHIEF JUVENILE COURT OFFICERS. Under current law, the chief 29 juvenile court officers are appointed, terminated for cause, 30 and otherwise act under the direction and supervision of the 31 chief judge for the judicial district in which the chief 32 juvenile court officer was appointed. The bill transfers the 33 chief judgesâ authority over chief juvenile court officers to 34 the director of juvenile court services. 35 -37- LSB 1457HV (4) 91 dg/ko 37/ 38 H.F. 833 DIVISION IV ââ HAWKI ELIGIBILITY ââ PUBLIC INSTITUTION 1 INMATES. The bill defines âpublic institutionâ to mean the 2 same as defined in 42 C.F.R. Â§435.1010. 3 Current law does not permit a child who is an inmate in a 4 public institution to be eligible for the Hawki program. The 5 bill requires HHS to suspend, but not terminate, Hawki program 6 eligibility for a child in a public institution if the child 7 is otherwise eligible for the Hawki program except for the 8 childâs status as an inmate, the child was enrolled in the 9 Hawki program at the time the child was committed to the public 10 institution, and 30 calendar days have elapsed since the date 11 the child was committed to the public institution. A childâs 12 suspension of Hawki benefits must continue for the duration of 13 the childâs commitment to a public institution. 14 The bill requires the public institution to which a child 15 is committed and HHS to provide monthly reports and expedite 16 the restoration of the childâs Hawki benefits upon the childâs 17 discharge from the public institution. The bill requires HHS 18 to adopt rules to administer the billâs provisions related to 19 Hawki benefits for children committed to a public institution. 20 DIVISION V ââ CORRECTIVE CHANGES. The bill updates 21 references to certain accrediting organizations through the 22 Code, corrects a reference throughout the Code related to 23 the citation for the definition of âreasonable effortsâ, 24 and changes the term âlegal custodianâ to the defined term 25 âcustodianâ. 26 -38- LSB 1457HV (4) 91 dg/ko 38/ 38

Under current law, a 22 psychiatric medical institution for children (PMIC) is an 23 institution providing more than 24 hours of continuous care 24 involving long-term psychiatric services to 3 or more children 25 in residence for expected periods of 14 days or more for 26 diagnosis and evaluation, or for expected periods of 90 days 27 or more for treatment. 28 The bill exempts PMICs from licensing requirements for 29 maintaining or conducting programs with the primary purpose 30 of treating and rehabilitating persons with a substance use 31 disorder. 32 The bill defines âapproved qualifying organizationâ as 33 the joint commission, the commission on the accreditation of 34 rehabilitation facilities, the council on accreditation, or a 35 -33- LSB 1457HV (4) 91 dg/ko 33/ 38 H.F. 833 nationally recognized accrediting organization with standards 1 comparable to the joint commission and commission on the 2 accreditation of rehabilitation facilities that are acceptable 3 under federal regulations. 4 The bill defines âmental health disorderâ as a mental 5 disorder as defined in the most recent version of the 6 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published 7 by the American psychiatric association, or a mental disorder 8 as defined in the most recent version of the international 9 classification of diseases published by the world health 10 organization. 11 The bill defines âprotective locked environmentâ as a 12 setting that prevents egress from a building or grounds as a 13 protective measure to ensure safety and security. 14 The bill defines ârecord check evaluation systemâ as the 15 record check evaluation system of HHS used to perform child and 16 dependent adult abuse record checks and to evaluate criminal 17 history and abuse records. 18 The bill defines âserious emotional disturbanceâ as a 19 diagnosable disorder of sufficient duration to meet diagnostic 20 criteria specified within the most current diagnostic and 21 statistical manual of mental disorders published by the 22 American psychiatric association that results in a functional 23 impairment. âSerious emotional disturbanceâ does not include a 24 substance use disorder or developmental disorder unless such 25 disorder co-occurs with such diagnosable mental, behavioral, 26 or emotional disorder. 27 The bill defines âsubstance use disorderâ as a diagnosable 28 substance use disorder of sufficient duration to meet 29 diagnostic criteria specified within the most current 30 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published 31 by the American psychiatric association that results in a 32 functional impairment. 33 The bill defines âyouthâ as a person who is less than 21 34 years of age. 35 -34- LSB 1457HV (4) 91 dg/ko 34/ 38 H.F. 833 The bill describes the nature of care a PMIC must offer youth 1 with a serious emotional disturbance (SED), a substance use 2 disorder (SUD), or both. 3 Under current law, a person who establishes a PMIC must 4 also hold a license under Code chapter 237 (child foster 5 care facilities) as a comprehensive residential facility for 6 children, or hold a license under Code chapter 125 (substance 7 use disorders) if the facility provides SUD treatment. The 8 bill eliminates the requirement that a PMIC holds either 9 of these additional licenses, and instead requires that an 10 applicant for a PMIC license specify whether the applicant will 11 provide SED services, SUD services, or both. A PMIC may only 12 provide services for which it is licensed. 13 The bill eliminates the requirement that a proposed PMIC be 14 under the direction of an agency which has previously operated 15 a facility for children or adolescents and meets or exceeds 16 requirements for licensure as a comprehensive residential 17 facility for children. 18 The bill requires the department of inspections, appeals 19 and licensing (DIAL), in cooperation with the department of 20 health and human services (HHS), to adopt rules relating to the 21 application of a protective locked environment in a PMIC. 22 Under current law, following the hospitalization hearing 23 on an involuntary commitment petition, if the court finds 24 by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent has a 25 serious mental impairment, the court shall order the respondent 26 committed for a complete psychiatric evaluation and appropriate 27 treatment. The chief medical officer (CMO) of the hospital or 28 facility at which a respondent is committed must report to the 29 court no more than 15 days after the date the respondent is 30 placed, making a recommendation for disposition of the matter. 31 The bill allows a court to place a minor respondent in a public 32 hospital and allows a CMO of the hospital no more than 30 33 days after the date the minor respondent is placed to make a 34 recommendation for disposition of the matter. 35 -35- LSB 1457HV (4) 91 dg/ko 35/ 38 H.F. 833 The bill defines âbehavioral health evaluationâ as a 1 comprehensive evaluation of a personâs mental and behavioral 2 health by a person licensed under Code chapter 154B 3 (psychology), 154C (social work), or 154D (behavioral science) 4 for purposes including but not limited to identifying a 5 possible behavioral health condition. 6 The bill defines âphysical assessmentâ as direct physical 7 touching, viewing, and medically necessary manipulation of any 8 area of a childâs body by a licensed physician. 9 The bill replaces several references to a physical or mental 10 examination with references to a physical assessment (PA) or 11 behavioral health evaluation (BHE) and replaces references to a 12 personâs abuse of alcohol or other controlled substances with 13 references to the person having a behavioral health condition. 14 Under current law, one of several specific circumstances 15 must exist before a juvenile court has the authority to enter 16 an ex parte order to direct a peace officer or a juvenile court 17 officer to take custody of a child before or after the filing 18 of a petition under Code chapter 232 (juvenile justice). The 19 bill adds the circumstance when the childâs parent, guardian, 20 or legal custodian consents to the removal as a condition that 21 would permit a juvenile court to enter such an ex parte order. 22 The bill creates similar provisions for when a juvenile court 23 may enter an ex parte order for a child to undergo an inpatient 24 PA or an inpatient BHE and when a person authorized to conduct 25 a preliminary investigation in response to a complaint 26 may motion to ask the court to order a child to undergo an 27 inpatient PA or an inpatient BHE. 28 The bill authorizes a court, after a dispositional hearing, 29 to order a male child in a child in need of assistance (CINA) 30 proceeding or a family in need of assistance (FINA) proceeding 31 to receive an inpatient PA, an inpatient BHE, or both, at the 32 state training school (STS). A request for the use of the STS 33 for purposes of a PA or BHE must be approved by the director of 34 HHS. A child ordered to the STS pursuant to a CINA proceeding 35 -36- LSB 1457HV (4) 91 dg/ko 36/ 38 H.F. 833 or a FINA proceeding must be separated at all times from 1 children placed in the STS pursuant to a juvenile delinquency 2 proceeding. Under current law, the court in a CINA or FINA 3 proceeding is prohibited from placing a child in the STS for 4 any reason. 5 The bill exempts a PMIC from licensing requirements for 6 child foster care. 7 The bill defines âprotective locked environmentâ as a 8 setting that prevents egress from a building or grounds as a 9 protective measure to ensure safety and security. The bill 10 directs HHS and DIAL to adopt rules relating to the application 11 of a protective locked environment to child foster care 12 licensees. 13 The bill directs HHS and DIAL to coordinate in developing 14 rules related to this division of the bill. The bill outlines 15 goals and considerations each department must take into account 16 while adopting such rules. 17 The bill makes conforming changes to Code chapters 135H 18 (psychiatric medical institutions for children) and 232 19 (juvenile justice). The bill repeals 2024 Iowa Acts, chapter 20 1161, sections 97 and 98. 21 DIVISION II ââ HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES ââ 22 HABILITATION SERVICES PROVIDED BY A RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM ââ 23 EXCLUSION FROM CHILDRENâS RESIDENTIAL FACILITY DEFINITION. The 24 bill excludes care furnished to persons 16 years of age or 25 older by certain residential programs detailed in the bill from 26 the definition of a childrenâs residential facility. 27 DIVISION III ââ DIRECTOR OF JUVENILE COURT SERVICES ââ 28 CHIEF JUVENILE COURT OFFICERS. Under current law, the chief 29 juvenile court officers are appointed, terminated for cause, 30 and otherwise act under the direction and supervision of the 31 chief judge for the judicial district in which the chief 32 juvenile court officer was appointed. The bill transfers the 33 chief judgesâ authority over chief juvenile court officers to 34 the director of juvenile court services. 35 -37- LSB 1457HV (4) 91 dg/ko 37/ 38 H.F. 833 DIVISION IV ââ HAWKI ELIGIBILITY ââ PUBLIC INSTITUTION 1 INMATES. The bill defines âpublic institutionâ to mean the 2 same as defined in 42 C.F.R. Â§435.1010. 3 Current law does not permit a child who is an inmate in a 4 public institution to be eligible for the Hawki program. The 5 bill requires HHS to suspend, but not terminate, Hawki program 6 eligibility for a child in a public institution if the child 7 is otherwise eligible for the Hawki program except for the 8 childâs status as an inmate, the child was enrolled in the 9 Hawki program at the time the child was committed to the public 10 institution, and 30 calendar days have elapsed since the date 11 the child was committed to the public institution. A childâs 12 suspension of Hawki benefits must continue for the duration of 13 the childâs commitment to a public institution. 14 The bill requires the public institution to which a child 15 is committed and HHS to provide monthly reports and expedite 16 the restoration of the childâs Hawki benefits upon the childâs 17 discharge from the public institution. The bill requires HHS 18 to adopt rules to administer the billâs provisions related to 19 Hawki benefits for children committed to a public institution. 20 DIVISION V ââ CORRECTIVE CHANGES. The bill updates 21 references to certain accrediting organizations through the 22 Code, corrects a reference throughout the Code related to 23 the citation for the definition of âreasonable effortsâ, 24 and changes the term âlegal custodianâ to the defined term 25 âcustodianâ. 26 -38- LSB 1457HV (4) 91 dg/ko 38/ 38
