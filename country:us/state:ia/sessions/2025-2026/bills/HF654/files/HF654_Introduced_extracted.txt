House File 654 - Introduced HOUSE FILE 654 BY COMMITTEE ON STATE GOVERNMENT (SUCCESSOR TO HF 438) A BILL FOR An Act concerning persons appointed to a convention called by 1 the United States Congress to propose amendments to the 2 Constitution of the United States, making appropriations, 3 and providing penalties. 4 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF IOWA: 5 TLSB 1110HV (1) 91 ss/ns H.F. 654 Section 1. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. The general assembly 1 finds all of the following: 2 1. Article V of the Constitution of the United States 3 contains two methods for proposing amendments to the 4 Constitution of the United States: 5 a. The proposal of amendments by Congress whenever 6 two-thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary. 7 b. The call of a convention for proposing amendments by 8 Congress upon the application of the legislatures of two-thirds 9 of the several states. 10 2. There have been over four hundred fifty applications 11 for an Article V convention of the states for the purpose of 12 proposing amendments. 13 3. Every state legislature except Hawaii has enacted one 14 or more resolutions calling for an Article V convention of the 15 states for the purpose of proposing amendments. Some states 16 have rescinded some or all of such resolutions. 17 4. Thirty-seven states have current resolutions calling 18 for an Article V convention of the states for the purpose 19 of proposing amendments. These states are: Alabama, 20 Alaska, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, 21 Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, 22 Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, 23 Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, 24 Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South 25 Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West 26 Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. 27 5. Each of these applications have specified topics for 28 such a convention. A very small number have been a call for 29 a general convention. The vast majority of applications have 30 been for a convention to propose amendments on a specified 31 topic. 32 6. No set of applications from the legislatures of the 33 several states has ever reached the threshold of two-thirds of 34 the states applying for a convention for the same topic. 35 -1- LSB 1110HV (1) 91 ss/ns 1/ 14 H.F. 654 7. An unwavering historical precedent has been established 1 for a valid application for an Article V convention of the 2 states for the purpose of proposing amendments, by requiring 3 two-thirds of the legislatures of the several states to apply 4 for a convention for amendments on the same topic or topics. 5 8. The general assembly of Iowa has passed nine resolutions 6 calling for an Article V convention of the states for the 7 purpose of proposing amendments on a variety of topics. Eight 8 of these resolutions are still valid, although three of them 9 are likely moot since the topic therein concerned the direct 10 election of United States senators. 11 9. There are contemporary efforts to call for an Article 12 V convention of the states for the purpose of proposing 13 amendments that have reached more than one-half of the required 14 number of states to require Congress to call such a convention. 15 10. It is in the best interest of the people of Iowa for 16 its general assembly to be prepared to nominate, credential, 17 and oversee the actions of delegates that it will appoint for 18 such a convention regardless of the topic if such convention 19 is called. 20 11. The historic record makes it clear that the founders 21 used the term âconvention of statesâ to describe the Article 22 V convention process. This terminology has at least one 23 particular legal meaning. It clarifies that the convention 24 will be in the form of states meeting as states. By 25 definition, all conventions of states require voting on the 26 basis of one state, one vote. 27 12. All stages of the convention process proceed on the 28 basis of one state, one vote. Two-thirds of the states are 29 required to call a convention. A majority of the states 30 are required to finalize the text of any proposed amendments 31 drafted by the convention. Three-fourths of the states are 32 required, via either their legislature or in ratification 33 conventions as shall be specified by Congress, to ratify the 34 text of any proposed amendment. 35 -2- LSB 1110HV (1) 91 ss/ns 2/ 14 H.F. 654 13. As established at the original constitutional 1 convention in Philadelphia in 1787, the legislature of each 2 state names its commissioners or delegates, and gives them such 3 instructions as the legislature deems appropriate. 4 14. Once two-thirds of the several states have applied for 5 a convention for the same topic, the duty of Congress to call a 6 convention is mandatory. 7 15. Litigation surrounding the ratification of the equal 8 rights amendment has established the principle that it is 9 unconstitutional to attempt to change the process for adopting 10 a constitutional amendment in the middle of the process. 11 Accordingly, it is unconstitutional for a convention to 12 consider amendments on any topic other than the topic for which 13 it was expressly called by the agreement of two-thirds of the 14 several states. 15 16. The supreme court of the United States has determined 16 that all actions of state legislatures arising under Article 17 V of the Constitution of the United States are based on their 18 authority under Article V of the Constitution of the United 19 States. Accordingly, the general assembly possesses intrinsic 20 power under the Constitution of the United States to call 21 itself into session at any time for the purpose of fulfilling 22 any of its duties under Article V. 23 Sec. 2. NEW SECTION . 38.1 Definitions. 24 As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise 25 requires: 26 1. âAdvisory committeeâ means a committee consisting of 27 members selected by each chamber using the process defined in 28 this chapter to perform the duties defined in this chapter. 29 2. âAlternate commissionerâ means a person designated to 30 replace a commissioner upon a vacancy. 31 3. âCallâ means a measure sent by Congress calling for an 32 Article V convention of states for the purpose of proposing 33 amendments to the Constitution of the United States. 34 4. âChamberâ means either the senate or the house of 35 -3- LSB 1110HV (1) 91 ss/ns 3/ 14 H.F. 654 representatives of the general assembly. 1 5. âCommissionerâ means a person selected by resolution of 2 the general assembly as provided in this chapter to represent 3 this state at an Article V convention of states for proposing 4 amendments. 5 6. âCommissioning resolutionâ means the resolution adopted 6 by both chambers which sets forth the names of the appointed 7 commissioners and their commissions and instructions. 8 7. âConventionâ means an Article V convention of states for 9 the purpose of proposing amendments to the Constitution of the 10 United States. 11 8. âDelegationâ means the group of commissioners and interim 12 commissioners chosen by the general assembly to represent Iowa 13 at an Article V convention with the powers and duties defined 14 in this chapter and as may be additionally set forth in the 15 commissioning resolution for a particular convention. 16 9. âScope of commissionerâs authorityâ means the limitation 17 on a commissioner to support only proposed amendments that 18 are directly within the topics specified in the resolutions 19 of two-thirds of the several states which gave rise to the 20 convention in question, which are enumerated in the credentials 21 of each commissioner. 22 Sec. 3.

A violation of this subsection is 26 punishable in Iowa regardless of where the prohibited act 27 occurs. 28 EXPLANATION 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 30 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 31 This bill relates to the appointment and regulation 32 of commissioners to a convention called by Congress to 33 propose amendments to the Constitution of the United States 34 (convention). The bill includes legislative findings. 35 -11- LSB 1110HV (1) 91 ss/ns 11/ 14 H.F. 654 The bill requires the majority leader of the senate and 1 the speaker of the house of representatives to call a special 2 session of the general assembly if Congress calls a convention 3 and the general assembly is not in session and is not scheduled 4 to be in session within 30 days.

A conference committee 22 appointed by the majority leader of the senate and the speaker 23 of the house of representatives shall select which alternate 24 member shall act as the fifth commissioner and which shall 25 serve as the first alternate commissioner. The bill also 26 requires each chamber to select two additional alternate 27 commissioners and provides a process for ranking the alternate 28 commissioners. 29 The bill requires the resolution appointing a commissioner 30 to contain prohibitions on supporting or voting for certain 31 proposals and amendments at a convention and the scope of the 32 commissionerâs authority, which shall be limited to the topic 33 of the convention. The bill allows the general assembly to 34 provide additional instructions to a commissioner by adoption 35 -12- LSB 1110HV (1) 91 ss/ns 12/ 14 H.F. 654 of a further resolution.

The bill 34 appropriates necessary moneys from the general fund for these 35 -13- LSB 1110HV (1) 91 ss/ns 13/ 14 H.F. 654 purposes. 1 The bill requires a commissioner to abide by the provisions 2 of Code section 68B.22 (gifts accepted or received) and to make 3 the same financial disclosures as required for a member of the 4 general assembly. The bill prohibits a person from making 5 expenditures to seek appointment as a commissioner or alternate 6 commissioner. 7 A commissioner who knowingly introduces, sponsors, or votes 8 for any proposed amendment that addresses a topic that is 9 beyond the scope of the commissionerâs authority is guilty of 10 a class âDâ felony, which shall constitute an infamous crime. 11 A class âDâ felony is punishable by confinement for no more 12 than five years and a fine of at least $1,025 but not more than 13 $10,245. Under the Constitution of the State of Iowa, a person 14 convicted of an infamous crime is not entitled to the privilege 15 of an elector. 16 A person who, except as authorized by law, knowingly 17 bribes, threatens, intimidates, or obstructs a commissioner 18 or alternate commissioner from Iowa, or from any state if 19 the convention is held in Iowa, in the performance of the 20 commissionerâs or alternate commissionerâs duties is guilty of 21 a class âDâ felony.

House File 654 - Introduced HOUSE FILE 654 BY COMMITTEE ON STATE GOVERNMENT (SUCCESSOR TO HF 438) A BILL FOR An Act concerning persons appointed to a convention called by 1 the United States Congress to propose amendments to the 2 Constitution of the United States, making appropriations, 3 and providing penalties. 4 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF IOWA: 5 TLSB 1110HV (1) 91 ss/ns H.F. 654 Section 1. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. The general assembly 1 finds all of the following: 2 1. Article V of the Constitution of the United States 3 contains two methods for proposing amendments to the 4 Constitution of the United States: 5 a. The proposal of amendments by Congress whenever 6 two-thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary. 7 b. The call of a convention for proposing amendments by 8 Congress upon the application of the legislatures of two-thirds 9 of the several states. 10 2. There have been over four hundred fifty applications 11 for an Article V convention of the states for the purpose of 12 proposing amendments. 13 3. Every state legislature except Hawaii has enacted one 14 or more resolutions calling for an Article V convention of the 15 states for the purpose of proposing amendments. Some states 16 have rescinded some or all of such resolutions. 17 4. Thirty-seven states have current resolutions calling 18 for an Article V convention of the states for the purpose 19 of proposing amendments. These states are: Alabama, 20 Alaska, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, 21 Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, 22 Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, 23 Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, 24 Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South 25 Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West 26 Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. 27 5. Each of these applications have specified topics for 28 such a convention. A very small number have been a call for 29 a general convention. The vast majority of applications have 30 been for a convention to propose amendments on a specified 31 topic. 32 6. No set of applications from the legislatures of the 33 several states has ever reached the threshold of two-thirds of 34 the states applying for a convention for the same topic. 35 -1- LSB 1110HV (1) 91 ss/ns 1/ 14 H.F. 654 7. An unwavering historical precedent has been established 1 for a valid application for an Article V convention of the 2 states for the purpose of proposing amendments, by requiring 3 two-thirds of the legislatures of the several states to apply 4 for a convention for amendments on the same topic or topics. 5 8. The general assembly of Iowa has passed nine resolutions 6 calling for an Article V convention of the states for the 7 purpose of proposing amendments on a variety of topics. Eight 8 of these resolutions are still valid, although three of them 9 are likely moot since the topic therein concerned the direct 10 election of United States senators. 11 9. There are contemporary efforts to call for an Article 12 V convention of the states for the purpose of proposing 13 amendments that have reached more than one-half of the required 14 number of states to require Congress to call such a convention. 15 10. It is in the best interest of the people of Iowa for 16 its general assembly to be prepared to nominate, credential, 17 and oversee the actions of delegates that it will appoint for 18 such a convention regardless of the topic if such convention 19 is called. 20 11. The historic record makes it clear that the founders 21 used the term âconvention of statesâ to describe the Article 22 V convention process. This terminology has at least one 23 particular legal meaning. It clarifies that the convention 24 will be in the form of states meeting as states. By 25 definition, all conventions of states require voting on the 26 basis of one state, one vote. 27 12. All stages of the convention process proceed on the 28 basis of one state, one vote. Two-thirds of the states are 29 required to call a convention. A majority of the states 30 are required to finalize the text of any proposed amendments 31 drafted by the convention. Three-fourths of the states are 32 required, via either their legislature or in ratification 33 conventions as shall be specified by Congress, to ratify the 34 text of any proposed amendment. 35 -2- LSB 1110HV (1) 91 ss/ns 2/ 14 H.F. 654 13. As established at the original constitutional 1 convention in Philadelphia in 1787, the legislature of each 2 state names its commissioners or delegates, and gives them such 3 instructions as the legislature deems appropriate. 4 14. Once two-thirds of the several states have applied for 5 a convention for the same topic, the duty of Congress to call a 6 convention is mandatory. 7 15. Litigation surrounding the ratification of the equal 8 rights amendment has established the principle that it is 9 unconstitutional to attempt to change the process for adopting 10 a constitutional amendment in the middle of the process. 11 Accordingly, it is unconstitutional for a convention to 12 consider amendments on any topic other than the topic for which 13 it was expressly called by the agreement of two-thirds of the 14 several states. 15 16. The supreme court of the United States has determined 16 that all actions of state legislatures arising under Article 17 V of the Constitution of the United States are based on their 18 authority under Article V of the Constitution of the United 19 States. Accordingly, the general assembly possesses intrinsic 20 power under the Constitution of the United States to call 21 itself into session at any time for the purpose of fulfilling 22 any of its duties under Article V. 23 Sec. 2.

The bill includes legislative findings. 35 -11- LSB 1110HV (1) 91 ss/ns 11/ 14 H.F. 654 The bill requires the majority leader of the senate and 1 the speaker of the house of representatives to call a special 2 session of the general assembly if Congress calls a convention 3 and the general assembly is not in session and is not scheduled 4 to be in session within 30 days. The special session shall be 5 limited to the matters listed in the bill. The bill requires a 6 delegation sent by Iowa to a convention to always consist of 7 five members (commissioners).

A conference committee 22 appointed by the majority leader of the senate and the speaker 23 of the house of representatives shall select which alternate 24 member shall act as the fifth commissioner and which shall 25 serve as the first alternate commissioner. The bill also 26 requires each chamber to select two additional alternate 27 commissioners and provides a process for ranking the alternate 28 commissioners. 29 The bill requires the resolution appointing a commissioner 30 to contain prohibitions on supporting or voting for certain 31 proposals and amendments at a convention and the scope of the 32 commissionerâs authority, which shall be limited to the topic 33 of the convention. The bill allows the general assembly to 34 provide additional instructions to a commissioner by adoption 35 -12- LSB 1110HV (1) 91 ss/ns 12/ 14 H.F. 654 of a further resolution. The bill requires each commissioner 1 to execute an oath in writing to obey the commission of the 2 commissioner, which shall be filed with the secretary of state. 3 The bill allows the general assembly to remove a 4 commissioner at any time for any reason by adoption of a 5 resolution by a constitutional majority of both chambers. The 6 bill allows an advisory committee, consisting of a member 7 selected by the majority leader of the senate, a member 8 selected by the speaker of the house of representatives, and a 9 third member selected by the presiding officer of the chamber 10 whose nominee for the fifth commissioner was not selected, 11 to remove a commissioner if the advisory committee finds by 12 a preponderance of the evidence that a commissioner acted 13 contrary to the commissionerâs commission or oath.

Under the Constitution of the State of Iowa, a person 14 convicted of an infamous crime is not entitled to the privilege 15 of an elector. 16 A person who, except as authorized by law, knowingly 17 bribes, threatens, intimidates, or obstructs a commissioner 18 or alternate commissioner from Iowa, or from any state if 19 the convention is held in Iowa, in the performance of the 20 commissionerâs or alternate commissionerâs duties is guilty of 21 a class âDâ felony. A violation of this provision of the bill 22 is punishable in Iowa regardless of where the prohibited act 23 occurs. 24 -14- LSB 1110HV (1) 91 ss/ns 14/ 14
