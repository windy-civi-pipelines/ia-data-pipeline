For districts approved before July 1, 2018, the area 14 consists of contiguous parcels and does not exceed twenty-five 15 acres in total.

RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY. This division of this 19 Act applies retroactively to July 1, 2020. 20 EXPLANATION 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 22 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 23 This bill relates to matters under the purview of the 24 economic development authority and the Iowa finance authority 25 including the strategic infrastructure program, brownfield, 26 grayfield, and redevelopment tax credits, community attraction 27 and tourism, vision Iowa, sports tourism marketing, the 28 historic preservation tax credit, homelessness, the title 29 guaranty board, and arts and culture. 30 Division I eliminates the requirement that the Iowa 31 innovation council review and make recommendations on all 32 applications received by the Iowa economic development 33 authority (IEDA) for financial assistance under the Iowa 34 strategic infrastructure program, and instead requires a 35 -16- LSB 1410HV (2) 91 nls/ko 16/ 22 H.F. 975 committee appointed by the IEDA director to conduct a review 1 and make recommendations. 2 Division II repeals the brownfield redevelopment program, 3 fund, and advisory council (council). 4 The bill requires that the amount of a redevelopment tax 5 credit be determined by members of the IEDA appointed by the 6 governor (the board), rather than determined by the board 7 in conjunction with the council as required under current 8 law. The IEDA shall accept and review applications for the 9 redevelopment tax credit and make award recommendations to 10 the board, rather than accept and review applications in 11 conjunction with the council as required under current law. 12 IEDA may engage outside experts to complete a technical, 13 financial, or other review. The bill makes conforming changes 14 related to elimination of the council. 15 Under current law, upon completion of a registered project 16 for redevelopment tax credits, an audit of the project 17 completed by an independent certified public accountant (CPA) 18 shall be submitted to the IEDA. Under the bill, the investor 19 shall engage a CPA to conduct an examination of the project 20 and submit the examination, and a statement of the amount of 21 final qualifying investments, to the IEDA. Upon review of the 22 examination and statement, the IEDA may issue a tax credit 23 certificate to the investor. 24 On the effective date of the bill, all unencumbered and 25 unobligated moneys remaining in the brownfield redevelopment 26 fund are transferred to a fund or funds established pursuant to 27 Code section 15.335B, as determined by the IEDA. 28 Division III eliminates the requirement that an applicant 29 awarded financial assistance under both the vision Iowa program 30 and the community attraction and tourism program provide and 31 pay at least 50 percent of the cost of a standard medical 32 insurance plan for all full-time employees after the completion 33 of the project for which financial assistance was received. 34 This division applies to applicants awarded financial 35 -17- LSB 1410HV (2) 91 nls/ko 17/ 22 H.F. 975 assistance under both programs on or after the effective date 1 of the bill, and applies retroactively to applicants awarded 2 financial assistance under both programs prior to the effective 3 date of the bill. 4 Under division IV, the director of the IEDA shall appoint a 5 review committee composed of members with relevant expertise to 6 review community attraction and tourism program applications 7 and sports tourism marketing and infrastructure program 8 applications. Under current law, the review committee is 9 composed of five members of the IEDA board. 10 Division V requires, in addition to existing requirements 11 for the historic preservation tax credit program (historic 12 tax program) under current law, for a project for the 13 rehabilitation of property to be considered a âqualified 14 rehabilitation projectâ (project), that the property not be a 15 single-family dwelling unit, unless the project will result 16 in two or more new single-family dwelling units that were 17 not available for occupancy for at least six months prior to 18 the project, and the dwelling units are located in the same 19 neighborhood as confirmed by the IEDA. The single-family 20 dwelling units must be made available for occupancy as a result 21 of the project. The IEDA may promulgate rules that specify the 22 criteria used to determine if a property is a single-family 23 dwelling unit, and to determine if a property is a qualified 24 rehabilitation project. 25 Under current law, upon successful registration of a 26 project under the historic tax program, the eligible taxpayer 27 (taxpayer) shall enter into an agreement with the IEDA that 28 contains mutually agreeable terms and conditions including the 29 commencement date of the project, which shall not be later than 30 the end of the fiscal year in which the agreement is entered 31 into, and the completion date of the project, which shall be 32 within 36 months of the commencement date. Under the bill, 33 the date by which the project must commence shall be no later 34 than one calendar year from the registration date, except 35 -18- LSB 1410HV (2) 91 nls/ko 18/ 22 H.F. 975 that upon application of the taxpayer the IEDA may extend the 1 date of commencement up to 12 additional months. The date by 2 which the project must be completed shall be no later than 3 three consecutive calendar years from the registration date, 4 except that upon application of the taxpayer, the IEDA may 5 extend the date of commencement up to another 12 months. The 6 project is complete as of the date the property is placed in 7 service. Upon application of the taxpayer made prior to the 8 expiration of the 12-month extension, the IEDA may extend the 9 date by which the project must be completed up to an additional 10 12 months. The taxpayer must substantiate that the requested 11 extension is warranted due to extenuating circumstances. 12 Under the bill, the IEDA may grant historic preservation 13 tax credits beyond the aggregate tax credit award limit in one 14 fiscal year if, during that fiscal year, the IEDA receives an 15 application for a project that has qualified rehabilitation 16 expenditures that, if registered, would make the taxpayer 17 eligible for tax credits of $10 million or more. The IEDA is 18 then permitted to award tax credits during that fiscal year not 19 to exceed 20 percent more than the maximum aggregate tax credit 20 award limit. Such tax credits awarded shall be considered for 21 purposes of calculating the maximum aggregate tax credit award 22 limit in the immediately succeeding fiscal year. 23 Under division VI, the Iowa finance authority (IFA) 24 may adopt rules to carry out the duties of IFA related to 25 homelessness, and may establish internal rules of procedure, 26 consistent with the requirements of the federal McKinney-Vento 27 Homeless Assistance Act. Under current law, IFA must adopt 28 rules. 29 Division VII eliminates the title guaranty division board. 30 The powers of the title guaranty division relating to the 31 issuance of title guaranties are vested in the IFA board of 32 directors. The director of the IFA shall appoint an attorney 33 as director of the division, and the division directorâs 34 appointment and compensation shall be exempt from the merit 35 -19- LSB 1410HV (2) 91 nls/ko 19/ 22 H.F. 975 system. The bill makes conforming changes to Code sections 1 16.1A, 16.91, 16.92, and 16.93. 2 Division VIII is related to arts and culture. Under current 3 law, the IEDA is responsible for the Iowa cultural trust, 4 including the issuance of trust fund credits for the promotion 5 of the arts, history, or the sciences and humanities; the 6 issuance of grants for qualified organizations; developing and 7 implementing fee-based educational programming opportunities; 8 conducting surveys of existing art and cultural programs 9 and activities within the state; and the establishment and 10 administration of a film office. The bill maintains the 11 responsibility for the IEDA to accept, receive, and administer 12 grants or other funds or gifts from public or private agencies; 13 to design and carry out a comprehensive, statewide, long-range 14 plan (plan) with the assistance of the Iowa arts council to 15 develop the arts in Iowa; and to establish advisory groups for 16 the receipt of federal funds or grants or the administration 17 of the IEDAâs programs. Under the bill, the IEDA is no longer 18 required to establish and administer a film office. Instead, 19 the IEDA is responsible for providing technical assistance for 20 the production of film, television, and video projects in the 21 state. 22 The bill eliminates certified cultural and entertainment 23 districts. The bill eliminates the cultural grant programs 24 under current law, which requires the IEDA to establish 25 a grant program for cities and nonprofit, tax-exempt 26 community organizations for the development of community 27 programs that provide local jobs for Iowa residents and 28 promote Iowaâs historic, ethnic, and cultural heritages 29 through the development of festivals, music, drama, cultural 30 programs, or tourist attractions. Additionally, the IEDA 31 is required to establish a grant program which provides 32 general operating budget support to major, multidisciplinary 33 cultural organizations that demonstrate cultural and managerial 34 excellence on a continuing basis to the citizens of Iowa. 35 -20- LSB 1410HV (2) 91 nls/ko 20/ 22 H.F. 975 Instead, the bill creates the arts and culture enhancement 1 fund (enhancement fund), under which the IEDA shall allocate 2 moneys to the fund to provide support to municipal and 3 nonprofit arts and cultural organizations that serve as 4 significant attractions or community resources; to support 5 artists and entities that foster artistic and cultural 6 expression, promote lifelong learning and engagement in the 7 arts, advance community development goals, or emphasize Iowaâs 8 diverse heritage through artwork; to increase access to arts 9 and culture in rural and underserved communities; for the 10 promotion of and investment in film, television, and video 11 projects produced in the state; and to address other goals and 12 priorities in the plan designed by the IEDA. The enhancement 13 fund consists of moneys appropriated by the general assembly 14 and any other moneys that are lawfully available to the IEDA. 15 Each fiscal year, $520,000 is appropriated from gambling 16 and sports wagering taxes to the IEDA for deposit in the 17 enhancement fund. The IEDA may establish and adopt by rule 18 eligibility and priority criteria for allocation of moneys in 19 the enhancement fund. 20 The Iowa arts council (arts council) may elect a chairperson 21 and vice chairperson from the members of the arts council, 22 rather than being designated by the governor under current law. 23 In addition to duties under current law, the arts council is 24 required to recommend programs to ensure that Iowa citizens and 25 communities have access to the cultural, civic, economic, and 26 educational benefits of the arts. 27 The bill repeals Code sections 15.437 through 15.441, 15.476 28 through 15.479, 15.481, and 15.482, eliminating the Iowa 29 cultural trust Act, including the Iowa cultural trust, trust 30 fund, grant account, and board of trustees, and eliminates the 31 arts and cultural conferences and caucuses, the cultural and 32 entertainment districts, the Iowa great places program and 33 fund, and the culture, history, and arts teams program. 34 On the effective date of this division of the bill, all 35 -21- LSB 1410HV (2) 91 nls/ko 21/ 22 H.F. 975 unencumbered and unobligated moneys remaining in the Iowa 1 great places program fund, Iowa cultural trust fund, and Iowa 2 cultural trust grant account are transferred to the arts and 3 culture enhancement fund established in the bill. 4 Division IX makes conforming changes to Code sections 16.6 5 and 16.64. 6 Under division X, if in addition to meeting the requirements 7 under current law, a district approved on or after July 1, 8 2020, consists of contiguous parcels and no more than 125 9 acres, the district may be eligible to be designated as a 10 reinvestment district. The division of the bill applies 11 retroactively to July 1, 2020. 12 -22- LSB 1410HV (2) 91 nls/ko 22/ 22

RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY. This division of this 19 Act applies retroactively to July 1, 2020. 20 EXPLANATION 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 22 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 23 This bill relates to matters under the purview of the 24 economic development authority and the Iowa finance authority 25 including the strategic infrastructure program, brownfield, 26 grayfield, and redevelopment tax credits, community attraction 27 and tourism, vision Iowa, sports tourism marketing, the 28 historic preservation tax credit, homelessness, the title 29 guaranty board, and arts and culture. 30 Division I eliminates the requirement that the Iowa 31 innovation council review and make recommendations on all 32 applications received by the Iowa economic development 33 authority (IEDA) for financial assistance under the Iowa 34 strategic infrastructure program, and instead requires a 35 -16- LSB 1410HV (2) 91 nls/ko 16/ 22 H.F. 975 committee appointed by the IEDA director to conduct a review 1 and make recommendations. 2 Division II repeals the brownfield redevelopment program, 3 fund, and advisory council (council). 4 The bill requires that the amount of a redevelopment tax 5 credit be determined by members of the IEDA appointed by the 6 governor (the board), rather than determined by the board 7 in conjunction with the council as required under current 8 law. The IEDA shall accept and review applications for the 9 redevelopment tax credit and make award recommendations to 10 the board, rather than accept and review applications in 11 conjunction with the council as required under current law. 12 IEDA may engage outside experts to complete a technical, 13 financial, or other review. The bill makes conforming changes 14 related to elimination of the council. 15 Under current law, upon completion of a registered project 16 for redevelopment tax credits, an audit of the project 17 completed by an independent certified public accountant (CPA) 18 shall be submitted to the IEDA. Under the bill, the investor 19 shall engage a CPA to conduct an examination of the project 20 and submit the examination, and a statement of the amount of 21 final qualifying investments, to the IEDA. Upon review of the 22 examination and statement, the IEDA may issue a tax credit 23 certificate to the investor. 24 On the effective date of the bill, all unencumbered and 25 unobligated moneys remaining in the brownfield redevelopment 26 fund are transferred to a fund or funds established pursuant to 27 Code section 15.335B, as determined by the IEDA. 28 Division III eliminates the requirement that an applicant 29 awarded financial assistance under both the vision Iowa program 30 and the community attraction and tourism program provide and 31 pay at least 50 percent of the cost of a standard medical 32 insurance plan for all full-time employees after the completion 33 of the project for which financial assistance was received. 34 This division applies to applicants awarded financial 35 -17- LSB 1410HV (2) 91 nls/ko 17/ 22 H.F. 975 assistance under both programs on or after the effective date 1 of the bill, and applies retroactively to applicants awarded 2 financial assistance under both programs prior to the effective 3 date of the bill. 4 Under division IV, the director of the IEDA shall appoint a 5 review committee composed of members with relevant expertise to 6 review community attraction and tourism program applications 7 and sports tourism marketing and infrastructure program 8 applications. Under current law, the review committee is 9 composed of five members of the IEDA board. 10 Division V requires, in addition to existing requirements 11 for the historic preservation tax credit program (historic 12 tax program) under current law, for a project for the 13 rehabilitation of property to be considered a âqualified 14 rehabilitation projectâ (project), that the property not be a 15 single-family dwelling unit, unless the project will result 16 in two or more new single-family dwelling units that were 17 not available for occupancy for at least six months prior to 18 the project, and the dwelling units are located in the same 19 neighborhood as confirmed by the IEDA. The single-family 20 dwelling units must be made available for occupancy as a result 21 of the project. The IEDA may promulgate rules that specify the 22 criteria used to determine if a property is a single-family 23 dwelling unit, and to determine if a property is a qualified 24 rehabilitation project. 25 Under current law, upon successful registration of a 26 project under the historic tax program, the eligible taxpayer 27 (taxpayer) shall enter into an agreement with the IEDA that 28 contains mutually agreeable terms and conditions including the 29 commencement date of the project, which shall not be later than 30 the end of the fiscal year in which the agreement is entered 31 into, and the completion date of the project, which shall be 32 within 36 months of the commencement date. Under the bill, 33 the date by which the project must commence shall be no later 34 than one calendar year from the registration date, except 35 -18- LSB 1410HV (2) 91 nls/ko 18/ 22 H.F. 975 that upon application of the taxpayer the IEDA may extend the 1 date of commencement up to 12 additional months. The date by 2 which the project must be completed shall be no later than 3 three consecutive calendar years from the registration date, 4 except that upon application of the taxpayer, the IEDA may 5 extend the date of commencement up to another 12 months. The 6 project is complete as of the date the property is placed in 7 service. Upon application of the taxpayer made prior to the 8 expiration of the 12-month extension, the IEDA may extend the 9 date by which the project must be completed up to an additional 10 12 months. The taxpayer must substantiate that the requested 11 extension is warranted due to extenuating circumstances. 12 Under the bill, the IEDA may grant historic preservation 13 tax credits beyond the aggregate tax credit award limit in one 14 fiscal year if, during that fiscal year, the IEDA receives an 15 application for a project that has qualified rehabilitation 16 expenditures that, if registered, would make the taxpayer 17 eligible for tax credits of $10 million or more. The IEDA is 18 then permitted to award tax credits during that fiscal year not 19 to exceed 20 percent more than the maximum aggregate tax credit 20 award limit. Such tax credits awarded shall be considered for 21 purposes of calculating the maximum aggregate tax credit award 22 limit in the immediately succeeding fiscal year. 23 Under division VI, the Iowa finance authority (IFA) 24 may adopt rules to carry out the duties of IFA related to 25 homelessness, and may establish internal rules of procedure, 26 consistent with the requirements of the federal McKinney-Vento 27 Homeless Assistance Act. Under current law, IFA must adopt 28 rules. 29 Division VII eliminates the title guaranty division board. 30 The powers of the title guaranty division relating to the 31 issuance of title guaranties are vested in the IFA board of 32 directors. The director of the IFA shall appoint an attorney 33 as director of the division, and the division directorâs 34 appointment and compensation shall be exempt from the merit 35 -19- LSB 1410HV (2) 91 nls/ko 19/ 22 H.F. 975 system. The bill makes conforming changes to Code sections 1 16.1A, 16.91, 16.92, and 16.93. 2 Division VIII is related to arts and culture. Under current 3 law, the IEDA is responsible for the Iowa cultural trust, 4 including the issuance of trust fund credits for the promotion 5 of the arts, history, or the sciences and humanities; the 6 issuance of grants for qualified organizations; developing and 7 implementing fee-based educational programming opportunities; 8 conducting surveys of existing art and cultural programs 9 and activities within the state; and the establishment and 10 administration of a film office. The bill maintains the 11 responsibility for the IEDA to accept, receive, and administer 12 grants or other funds or gifts from public or private agencies; 13 to design and carry out a comprehensive, statewide, long-range 14 plan (plan) with the assistance of the Iowa arts council to 15 develop the arts in Iowa; and to establish advisory groups for 16 the receipt of federal funds or grants or the administration 17 of the IEDAâs programs. Under the bill, the IEDA is no longer 18 required to establish and administer a film office. Instead, 19 the IEDA is responsible for providing technical assistance for 20 the production of film, television, and video projects in the 21 state. 22 The bill eliminates certified cultural and entertainment 23 districts. The bill eliminates the cultural grant programs 24 under current law, which requires the IEDA to establish 25 a grant program for cities and nonprofit, tax-exempt 26 community organizations for the development of community 27 programs that provide local jobs for Iowa residents and 28 promote Iowaâs historic, ethnic, and cultural heritages 29 through the development of festivals, music, drama, cultural 30 programs, or tourist attractions. Additionally, the IEDA 31 is required to establish a grant program which provides 32 general operating budget support to major, multidisciplinary 33 cultural organizations that demonstrate cultural and managerial 34 excellence on a continuing basis to the citizens of Iowa. 35 -20- LSB 1410HV (2) 91 nls/ko 20/ 22 H.F. 975 Instead, the bill creates the arts and culture enhancement 1 fund (enhancement fund), under which the IEDA shall allocate 2 moneys to the fund to provide support to municipal and 3 nonprofit arts and cultural organizations that serve as 4 significant attractions or community resources; to support 5 artists and entities that foster artistic and cultural 6 expression, promote lifelong learning and engagement in the 7 arts, advance community development goals, or emphasize Iowaâs 8 diverse heritage through artwork; to increase access to arts 9 and culture in rural and underserved communities; for the 10 promotion of and investment in film, television, and video 11 projects produced in the state; and to address other goals and 12 priorities in the plan designed by the IEDA. The enhancement 13 fund consists of moneys appropriated by the general assembly 14 and any other moneys that are lawfully available to the IEDA. 15 Each fiscal year, $520,000 is appropriated from gambling 16 and sports wagering taxes to the IEDA for deposit in the 17 enhancement fund. The IEDA may establish and adopt by rule 18 eligibility and priority criteria for allocation of moneys in 19 the enhancement fund. 20 The Iowa arts council (arts council) may elect a chairperson 21 and vice chairperson from the members of the arts council, 22 rather than being designated by the governor under current law. 23 In addition to duties under current law, the arts council is 24 required to recommend programs to ensure that Iowa citizens and 25 communities have access to the cultural, civic, economic, and 26 educational benefits of the arts. 27 The bill repeals Code sections 15.437 through 15.441, 15.476 28 through 15.479, 15.481, and 15.482, eliminating the Iowa 29 cultural trust Act, including the Iowa cultural trust, trust 30 fund, grant account, and board of trustees, and eliminates the 31 arts and cultural conferences and caucuses, the cultural and 32 entertainment districts, the Iowa great places program and 33 fund, and the culture, history, and arts teams program. 34 On the effective date of this division of the bill, all 35 -21- LSB 1410HV (2) 91 nls/ko 21/ 22 H.F. 975 unencumbered and unobligated moneys remaining in the Iowa 1 great places program fund, Iowa cultural trust fund, and Iowa 2 cultural trust grant account are transferred to the arts and 3 culture enhancement fund established in the bill. 4 Division IX makes conforming changes to Code sections 16.6 5 and 16.64. 6 Under division X, if in addition to meeting the requirements 7 under current law, a district approved on or after July 1, 8 2020, consists of contiguous parcels and no more than 125 9 acres, the district may be eligible to be designated as a 10 reinvestment district. The division of the bill applies 11 retroactively to July 1, 2020. 12 -22- LSB 1410HV (2) 91 nls/ko 22/ 22
