6 products (Code chapter 189A); and the marketing of grain and
7 the indemnification of losses by grain depositors and sellers

9 CROP PRODUCTION —— APPLICATION OF NUTRIENTS —— BACKGROUND.
10 The department of agriculture and land stewardship (DALS)
11 regulates the composition of soil inputs, including nutrients
12 such as fertilizers which are manufactured to achieve optimum
13 plant growth under the Iowa fertilizer law (Code section
14 200.1), which includes a number of definitions (Code section
15 200.3). DALS also regulates fertilizing material which is
16 a substance used to compound a fertilizer, and a commercial
17 fertilizer which refers to a fertilizer, fertilizing material,
18 and a fertilizer-pesticide mixture. A secondary input is
19 referred to as a soil conditioner which is a substance other
20 than a fertilizer that improves the condition or structure
21 of the soil and is also used to improve plant growth. DALS
22 licenses persons who manufacture, offer for sale, sell, or
23 distribute a fertilizer or soil conditioner. The person is
24 also subject to a license fee (Code section 200.4). Each brand
25 or grade of commercial fertilizer or soil conditioner must
26 be registered with DALS (Code section 200.5). A fertilizer
27 or soil conditioner is subject to label requirements (Code
28 section 200.6). DALS imposes an inspection fee upon a
29 licensee (Code section 200.8). DALS must sample, inspect,
30 make analysis of, and test a commercial fertilizer or soil
31 conditioner distributed within the state (Code section 200.10).
32 A person is prohibited from manufacturing, offering for sale,
33 or selling a commercial fertilizer or soil conditioner that
34 is injurious to crop growth or deleterious to the soil (Code
35 section 200.11). A person selling a commercial fertilizer

6 take administrative action against a licensee or registrant
7 acting in violation of the law, including by canceling the
8 license or registration (Code section 200.15), issuing a stop
9 order (Code section 200.16), or seizing a commercial fertilizer
10 or soil conditioner (Code section 200.17). A county, city,
11 or other political subdivision is prohibited from passing or
12 enforcing local legislation that regulates the use, sale,
13 distribution, storage, transportation, disposal, formulation,
14 labeling, registration, or manufacture of a fertilizer or soil
15 conditioner (Code section 200.22). A person registering a

17 section 206.12). A number of Code sections include a reference
18 to soil conditioners: the definition of agricultural land
19 for purposes of eminent domain (Code section 6A.21) and urban
20 renewal (Code section 403.17) each include such a reference.
21 A transportation regulation involving hazardous materials
22 includes soil conditioners (Code section 321.1). A commodity
23 production contract lien (Code section 579B.1) covers the use
24 of a soil conditioner. An exception to the criminal offense
25 of critical infrastructure sabotage includes the use of a soil
26 conditioner (Code section 716.11).
27 CROP PRODUCTION —— APPLICATION OF NUTRIENTS —— BILL. The
28 bill replaces the term soil conditioner with beneficial
29 substance which is defined as a substance or compound that is
30 beneficial to one or more species of plants, soil, or media.
31 It includes a plant amendment, plant biostimulant, plant
32 inoculant, soil-amending ingredient, soil-amending form, soil
33 amendment, and soil inoculant. The bill changes references to
34 the state chemist to the bureau chief of the Iowa laboratory
35 bureau (Code sections 190C.22 and 200.10).

1 APPLICATION OF PESTICIDES —— CERTIFICATION —— BACKGROUND.
2 DALS is responsible for the administration and enforcement of
3 the “Pesticide Act of Iowa” (Code chapter 206), which in part
4 regulates the use of a pesticide by a commercial applicator,
5 public applicator, or private applicator (Code section 206.2).
6 Generally, a person acting as a commercial applicator or public
7 applicator must be certified to apply any pesticide, and a
8 person acting as a commercial applicator, public applicator,
9 or private applicator (e.g., a farmer) must be certified to
10 apply a restricted use pesticide (Code section 206.5). The
11 designation “restricted use” is determined by DALS (Code
12 section 206.20) and is generally based on a pesticide so
13 classified by the United States environmental protection agency
14 (40 C.F.R. §152.160 et seq.). DALS is required to administer
15 an educational program in cooperation with the Iowa cooperative
16 extension service in agriculture and home economics of Iowa
17 state university of science and technology. In order to be
18 certified, a person must participate in the educational program
19 by passing an examination for an initial certification and pass
20 an examination or attend instructional hours every three years
21 for the renewal of the certification (Code section 206.5).
22 APPLICATION OF PESTICIDES —— CERTIFICATION —— BILL. The
23 bill removes a requirement that DALS adopt by rule criteria
24 allowing a person required to be certified to complete either a
25 written or oral examination. The bill provides that DALS has
26 discretion to adopt such rules.
27 ANIMAL HEALTH —— CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS OR CONTAGIOUS
28 DISEASES AFFLICTING ANIMALS —— BACKGROUND. DALS is granted
29 authority to provide for the health of animals and specifically
30 the control of an infectious or contagious disease (disease)
31 afflicting livestock populations (Code chapter 163). The term
32 “control” refers to prevention, suppression, or eradication
33 efforts (Code section 163.2).
34 ANIMAL HEALTH —— CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS OR CONTAGIOUS
35 DISEASES AFFLICTING ANIMALS —— BILL. The bill provides that
LSB 1411XD (17) 91
-42- da/ns 42/47

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 DALS may determine and employ the most efficient and practical
2 means to identify and control a possible, imminent, or actual
3 threat to an animal population caused by a disease.
4 The bill provides that DALS may adopt any necessary rules
5 for the control of an infectious disease affecting animals
6 within the state by emergency rulemaking. When a statute
7 authorizes emergency rulemaking, an agency may adopt a rule
8 immediately without going through the periods of the rulemaking
9 process known as regulatory analysis (Code section 17A.4A)
10 and notice of intended action (Code section 17A.4(3)). The
11 bill requires that such emergency rulemaking be “double
12 barreled”. Under the process known as double-barreled
13 rulemaking, when an agency files an emergency rule, it also
14 files the same rule as a notice of intended action that will
15 follow the regular rulemaking process. Normally, a rule
16 cannot be effective prior to 35 days after its filing with the
17 administrative rules coordinator and publication in the Iowa
18 administrative bulletin. Under emergency rulemaking, a rule
19 can be made effective on the date of filing and acceptance
20 by the administrative rules coordinator or any subsequent
21 date, as specified by the agency in the filing (Code section
22 17A.5(2)(b)(1)).
23 ANIMAL HEALTH —— PRACTICE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE ——
24 BACKGROUND. Veterinarians are regulated by the board of
25 veterinary medicine (veterinary board) which is responsible
26 for licensing and imposing disciplinary action, including the
27 suspension or revocation of a license for cause following a
28 notice and hearing before the veterinary board. The basis for
29 disciplinary action includes making a false representation,
30 being convicted of a felony in Iowa or another jurisdiction,
31 violating a statute or law of Iowa or another jurisdiction,
32 being subject to disciplinary action in another state,
33 assisting in the unlawful practice of veterinary medicine,
34 being adjudged as mentally incompetent, failing to conform
35 with an acceptable practice of veterinary medicine, and being
LSB 1411XD (17) 91
-43- da/ns 43/47

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 unable to practice veterinary medicine with reasonable skill
2 and safety (amended Code section 169.13).
3 ANIMAL HEALTH —— PRACTICE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE —— BILL.
4 The bill provides that, in addition to imposing disciplinary
5 action, the veterinary board may assess a civil penalty.
6 The amount of the civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000 per
7 violation. The attorney general may initiate a claim to
8 collect a civil penalty and any amount collected must be
9 deposited in the general fund of the state.
10 ANIMAL HEALTH —— COURT-ORDERED MANAGEMENT OF LIVESTOCK
11 IN IMMEDIATE NEED OF SUSTENANCE —— BACKGROUND. DALS is
12 granted the authority to petition a court to conduct a hearing
13 regarding the condition of livestock. If the court determines
14 that the livestock are in immediate need of sustenance, it
15 must issue an order directing DALS to assume supervision of
16 the livestock (Code section 717.3). The order creates a
17 super-priority lien attached to the livestock, proceeds from
18 the sale of livestock, and any associated unmanufactured
19 products, for the benefit of DALS. DALS may also petition
20 a court to order the disposition of the specified livestock.
21 The proceeds from the sale of the livestock are to be used to
22 reimburse DALS according to the lien’s super-priority status.
23 DALS may also utilize moneys deposited in the livestock
24 remediation fund (remediation fund) (Code section 459.501)
25 to pay for costs of providing for sustenance to livestock as
26 provided in the court order (Code section 717.4A).
27 ANIMAL HEALTH —— COURT-ORDERED MANAGEMENT OF LIVESTOCK
28 IN IMMEDIATE NEED OF SUSTENANCE —— BILL. The bill rewrites
29 a provision requiring DALS to repay the remediation fund
30 any proceeds that DALS receives from the disposition of the
31 livestock less expenses in providing for the sustenance and
32 disposition. The bill provides that if the court orders the
33 disposition of the livestock, the order shall be deemed as
34 acting in response to a petition by a receiver appointed by a
35 court in Code chapter 680.

1 AGRICULTURAL PROCESSING —— SLAUGHTER AND PROCESSING OF MEAT
2 AND POULTRY PRODUCTS —— LICENSURE —— BILL. The bill provides
3 that a home food processing establishment licensed by the
4 department of inspections, appeals, and licensing is exempt
5 from DALS licensing requirements (Code chapter 137D). A home
6 food processing establishment refers to a residence in which
7 homemade food items are produced for sale, if consumption is
8 off premises and its business has gross annual sales of less
9 than $50,000 (Code section 137D.1). The bill also provides
10 that the term of a license issued by DALS to a slaughter and
11 processing establishment is extended to a two-year period (from
12 July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2027). The licensee fee is doubled
13 from $25 to $50 and from $50 to $100 to reflect the license’s
14 biennial term. DALS is required to prorate the license fee
15 for a new establishment. The bill makes various changes in
16 terminology to improve readability.
17 AGRICULTURAL MARKETING —— MARKETING OF GRAIN AND
18 INDEMNIFICATION OF LOSSES —— BACKGROUND. DALS licenses and
19 regulates grain dealers (dealers) and warehouse operators
20 (operators) (Code chapters 203 and 203C). Both dealers and
21 operators may be required to pay fees into the grain depositors
22 and sellers indemnity fund (indemnity fund) for purposes of
23 indemnifying losses incurred by sellers and depositors as
24 part of a transaction (Code chapter 203D). A participation
25 fee is assessed against a dealer based on purchased grain
26 during the dealer’s last fiscal year and against an operator
27 based on warehouse storage capacity. In addition, a dealer
28 may be assessed a per-bushel fee on a quarterly basis. The
29 assessment year in which a participation fee and per-bushel fee
30 is assessed is from September 1 to August 31. The assessment
31 year is divided into four three-month quarters. The last date
32 of the quarter is referred to as an installment date which
33 is when a quarterly participation payment is due. The fees
34 are deposited in the indemnity fund. When the balance in the
35 fund reaches $8 million, the participation fee and per-bushel
LSB 1411XD (17) 91
-45- da/ns 45/47

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 fees are automatically waived. The fees are reinstated if the
2 balance in the fund reaches $3 million or less (Code section
3 203D.5).
4 The indemnity fund is established as an insurance pool to
5 pay a depositor who has stored grain with a licensed warehouse
6 operator for a loss resulting from the depositor’s right to
7 receive possession of the grain, and a seller who sells grain
8 to a licensed grain dealer for a loss resulting from a failure
9 to receive payment for that grain (Code section 203D.6). The
10 indemnity fund is administered by the Iowa grain indemnity
11 fund board (indemnity board) in cooperation with DALS. A
12 depositor or seller must file a claim against the indemnity
13 fund within 120 days of an incurrence date which is the date
14 that the license of the operator or dealer ceases to be valid
15 (e.g., by revocation) or the date that an operator or dealer
16 files a petition in bankruptcy. The claim must derive from
17 a covered transaction, meaning that the claimant who is a
18 depositor must have delivered the grain to an operator or a
19 claimant who is a seller must have transferred title to the
20 grain to a dealer other than by credit-sale contract within
21 six months of the incurrence date. A credit-sale contract is
22 a contract for the sale of grain if the sale price for that
23 grain is to be paid more than 30 days after the delivery of
24 the grain to the buyer (also referred to as a deferred-payment
25 contract, deferred-pricing contract, and price-later contract).
26 A depositor or seller who timely files an eligible claim is
27 entitled to be paid from the indemnity fund for 90 percent
28 of a loss up to $300,000. If the indemnity board determines
29 that there are insufficient moneys in the indemnity fund to
30 make payment on all claims, the indemnity board may order that
31 payment on specified claims be deferred. Other procedures that
32 apply include a right to appeal the indemnity board’s decision,
33 subrogation rights, and a five-year expiration period for
34 unresolved claims.

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 INDEMNIFICATION OF LOSSES —— FEES —— BILL. The bill provides
2 that a dealer or operator may remit the participation fee in
3 one installment as part of the license renewal or on four
4 successive installment dates on December 15, March 15, June 15,
5 and September 15. The bill provides that the dealer may pay
6 the per-bushel fee on the same installment dates.
7 AGRICULTURAL MARKETING —— MARKETING OF GRAIN AND
8 INDEMNIFICATION OF LOSSES —— REPAYMENT CLAIMS —— BILL. The
9 bill allows a seller to file a special repayment claim against
10 the fund as a result of the grain dealer’s bankruptcy. The
11 special repayment process allows such a seller to recover
12 the amount of the grain dealer payment that the seller was
13 forced to repay to the grain dealer’s bankruptcy estate. To
14 be timely, a seller must file a repayment claim with DALS not
15 later than 30 days after the repayment loss is finalized by a
16 bankruptcy court. DALS may provide notice of the repayment
17 claim process to a seller who may file a repayment claim.
18 If DALS chooses to provide a notice to the seller, DALS has
19 discretion to determine a reasonable method and manner of
20 providing such notice. The indemnity board must determine that
21 a repayment claim is eligible for payment from the indemnity
22 fund, including whether the repayment claim derives from a
23 covered transaction. DALS is required to deliver notice to
24 a seller filing a repayment claim regarding the indemnity
25 board’s determination in the same manner as for an ordinary
26 loss. Like an ordinary loss, the seller is entitled to receive
27 90 percent of a loss but not more than $300,000, a deferral of
28 payments based on insufficient moneys in the indemnity fund,
29 subrogation, and a five-year expiration period.
