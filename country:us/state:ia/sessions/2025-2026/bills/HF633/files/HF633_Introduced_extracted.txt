EFFECTIVE DATE. The following takes effect January 26 1, 2026: 27 The portion of the section of this Act amending section 28 331.606, subsection 1. 29 EXPLANATION 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 31 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 32 This bill relates to certain required document criteria to 33 file documents and instruments with county recorders, fees 34 paid for recording documents, funds created for recorders and 35 -15- LSB 1802YH (1) 91 ll/js 15/ 19 H.F. 633 the electronic services system and associated authorization 1 for spending moneys in those funds for certain purposes, the 2 creation of the electronic services system, organized by an 3 agreement pursuant to Code chapter 28E (28E agreement), and 4 the electronic filing system used to accept, manage, and make 5 available county recorder filings electronically. Under 6 current law, county recorders are required to execute a 28E 7 agreement with other counties to implement a county land 8 record information system in accordance with 2005 Iowa Acts, 9 chapter 179, section 101, subsection 1, as amended by 2021 Iowa 10 Acts, chapter 126, section 2. The bill amends this provision 11 to require county recorders to enter into a 28E agreement 12 to create and implement the electronic services system, a 13 statewide electronic county land record management system. The 14 bill defines âelectronic services systemâ as the organization 15 formed under the 28E agreement. The electronic services system 16 is also the name of the actual electronic system implemented to 17 accept, manage, and make available records filed with a county 18 recorder. 19 Several sections of Code chapter 331, subchapter V, 20 part 3, pertaining to the county recorder are amended to 21 specify certain requirements for documents or instruments 22 submitted to a county recorder for filing either in person 23 or electronically. Many of these requirements pertain to 24 required recording references, indexing, formatting, text, 25 margin sizes, and document size limitations with an emphasis on 26 legibility. References to the county land record information 27 system are removed throughout Code chapter 331 and replaced 28 with âelectronic services systemâ. 29 Under current law, in addition to the $5 county recorders 30 collect for each page of a document or instrument filed in 31 the county recorderâs office, $1 is collected for the county 32 recorderâs records management fund, and $1 is collected for 33 the county recorderâs electronic transaction fund. The bill 34 changes the fees to a flat fee of $10 for each page filed or 35 -16- LSB 1802YH (1) 91 ll/js 16/ 19 H.F. 633 recorded in the recorderâs office, with a maximum recording fee 1 of $500 for 50 or more pages filed. From the total fee of $10 2 per page of a document or instrument filed with a recorder, $2 3 is transferred to the recorderâs technology advancement fund 4 and $3 is transferred to the recorderâs electronic services 5 system fund. 6 The bill eliminates the county recorderâs records management 7 funds and creates recorderâs technology advancement funds to 8 be used for the following purposes: maintaining and improving 9 equipment, software, and systems; preserving and maintaining 10 archived physical and electronic documents or instruments; 11 converting physical documents to electronic documents; and 12 education and training for advancing technology. The bill 13 eliminates the county recorderâs electronic transaction funds 14 and creates recorderâs electronic services funds. By the first 15 day of each month, the treasurer shall transfer the moneys 16 deposited into the recorderâs electronic services system fund 17 to an account in a financial institution designated by the 18 governing board of the electronic services system to be used 19 as outlined in new Code section 331.605B for the following 20 purposes: to enable electronic filing for recording documents; 21 to provide electronic access to recorded public documents; to 22 receive electronic payments to process electronic documents 23 for recording; to implement security and redaction systems to 24 protect personally identifiable information; to integrate with 25 other appropriate real property filing or management systems; 26 to establish standards for processing, recording, indexing, 27 accessing, and archiving documents for electronic county land 28 record management systems; and to develop a notification system 29 for users when electronic filings or records are associated 30 with the userâs name, property, or other recorded filing 31 information. The recorder or the electronic services system 32 shall make available any information required by the county 33 auditor or auditor of state concerning the moneys collected 34 from fees and the uses for which such fees are expended. 35 -17- LSB 1802YH (1) 91 ll/js 17/ 19 H.F. 633 The county treasurer must transfer moneys remaining in the 1 county recorderâs records management fund to the recorderâs 2 technology advancement fund and moneys remaining in the county 3 recorderâs electronic transaction fund to the recorderâs 4 electronic services fund on the effective date of the bill. 5 The bill provides that any moneys remaining in the local 6 government electronic transaction fund after the effective date 7 of the bill are appropriated to the treasurer of state to be 8 used by the treasurer of state to assist the governing board of 9 the electronic services system in accomplishing the purposes 10 stated in Code section 331.605B(1). 11 The electronic services system may collect a fee of not more 12 than $3 per recorded document, along with any service charges 13 associated with a credit or debit card payment, to receive and 14 process a document or instrument. Moneys collected from these 15 fees by the electronic services system must be used for the 16 same purposes as the recorderâs electronic services fund. The 17 electronic services system cannot charge a fee for viewing, 18 accessing, or printing records and cannot provide access to 19 records on a batch basis. 20 The bill limits tort liability of government subdivisions 21 by excluding contractors hired by the governing board of the 22 electronic services systems from government employees. 23 The bill creates a process for a county recorder to decline 24 acceptance of a physical or electronic document and to provide 25 information to the filer to correct the defect. A recorderâs 26 ability to collect an additional recording fee of $10 per 27 document to accept nonconforming documents is eliminated. 28 The information required to be included by a recorder 29 who is filing and indexing documents or instruments into the 30 electronic county land record management system is outlined 31 and includes how reference numbers must be determined and 32 applied to filings each calendar year, the use of only numeric 33 references containing no more than eight digits preceded by 34 a county two-digit code and four-digit year, and indexing 35 -18- LSB 1802YH (1) 91 ll/js 18/ 19 H.F. 633 requirements for certain recorded documents associated with 1 the recording. Additionally, the following shall be indexed 2 if known: a parcel identification number; a legal description 3 and parsed location information including platted and unplatted 4 information; and any additional parcel identifiers used by a 5 recorder. The indexing and recording requirements outlined in 6 the bill take effect January 1, 2026. Additionally, a recorder 7 must note in the index the exact hour, minute, and second a 8 document or instrument is recorded. 9 The bill provides for the recording of surveys in new Code 10 section 331.612. Specific text sizing and formatting along 11 with page sizing, index legend requirements, and other required 12 information for surveys, plats, subdivision plats, and monument 13 preservation certificates, with an emphasis on legibility, 14 are provided. The recorder must accept a plat or subdivision 15 plat that meets the requirements outlined in Code section 16 355.7, 355.7A, or 355.8 submitted electronically through the 17 electronic services system. The bill also provides for the use 18 of cover pages when submitting the information required in Code 19 section 331.606B(2) and outlines the location on the first page 20 where the information must be provided when filing a document 21 with the county recorder along with providing guidelines for 22 including designated space for a county recorderâs use. 23 -19- LSB 1802YH (1) 91 ll/js 19/ 19

The bill amends this provision 11 to require county recorders to enter into a 28E agreement 12 to create and implement the electronic services system, a 13 statewide electronic county land record management system. The 14 bill defines âelectronic services systemâ as the organization 15 formed under the 28E agreement. The electronic services system 16 is also the name of the actual electronic system implemented to 17 accept, manage, and make available records filed with a county 18 recorder. 19 Several sections of Code chapter 331, subchapter V, 20 part 3, pertaining to the county recorder are amended to 21 specify certain requirements for documents or instruments 22 submitted to a county recorder for filing either in person 23 or electronically. Many of these requirements pertain to 24 required recording references, indexing, formatting, text, 25 margin sizes, and document size limitations with an emphasis on 26 legibility. References to the county land record information 27 system are removed throughout Code chapter 331 and replaced 28 with âelectronic services systemâ. 29 Under current law, in addition to the $5 county recorders 30 collect for each page of a document or instrument filed in 31 the county recorderâs office, $1 is collected for the county 32 recorderâs records management fund, and $1 is collected for 33 the county recorderâs electronic transaction fund. The bill 34 changes the fees to a flat fee of $10 for each page filed or 35 -16- LSB 1802YH (1) 91 ll/js 16/ 19 H.F. 633 recorded in the recorderâs office, with a maximum recording fee 1 of $500 for 50 or more pages filed.

The recorder or the electronic services system 32 shall make available any information required by the county 33 auditor or auditor of state concerning the moneys collected 34 from fees and the uses for which such fees are expended. 35 -17- LSB 1802YH (1) 91 ll/js 17/ 19 H.F. 633 The county treasurer must transfer moneys remaining in the 1 county recorderâs records management fund to the recorderâs 2 technology advancement fund and moneys remaining in the county 3 recorderâs electronic transaction fund to the recorderâs 4 electronic services fund on the effective date of the bill. 5 The bill provides that any moneys remaining in the local 6 government electronic transaction fund after the effective date 7 of the bill are appropriated to the treasurer of state to be 8 used by the treasurer of state to assist the governing board of 9 the electronic services system in accomplishing the purposes 10 stated in Code section 331.605B(1). 11 The electronic services system may collect a fee of not more 12 than $3 per recorded document, along with any service charges 13 associated with a credit or debit card payment, to receive and 14 process a document or instrument. Moneys collected from these 15 fees by the electronic services system must be used for the 16 same purposes as the recorderâs electronic services fund. The 17 electronic services system cannot charge a fee for viewing, 18 accessing, or printing records and cannot provide access to 19 records on a batch basis. 20 The bill limits tort liability of government subdivisions 21 by excluding contractors hired by the governing board of the 22 electronic services systems from government employees. 23 The bill creates a process for a county recorder to decline 24 acceptance of a physical or electronic document and to provide 25 information to the filer to correct the defect. A recorderâs 26 ability to collect an additional recording fee of $10 per 27 document to accept nonconforming documents is eliminated. 28 The information required to be included by a recorder 29 who is filing and indexing documents or instruments into the 30 electronic county land record management system is outlined 31 and includes how reference numbers must be determined and 32 applied to filings each calendar year, the use of only numeric 33 references containing no more than eight digits preceded by 34 a county two-digit code and four-digit year, and indexing 35 -18- LSB 1802YH (1) 91 ll/js 18/ 19 H.F. 633 requirements for certain recorded documents associated with 1 the recording.

Specific text sizing and formatting along 11 with page sizing, index legend requirements, and other required 12 information for surveys, plats, subdivision plats, and monument 13 preservation certificates, with an emphasis on legibility, 14 are provided. The recorder must accept a plat or subdivision 15 plat that meets the requirements outlined in Code section 16 355.7, 355.7A, or 355.8 submitted electronically through the 17 electronic services system. The bill also provides for the use 18 of cover pages when submitting the information required in Code 19 section 331.606B(2) and outlines the location on the first page 20 where the information must be provided when filing a document 21 with the county recorder along with providing guidelines for 22 including designated space for a county recorderâs use. 23 -19- LSB 1802YH (1) 91 ll/js 19/ 19
