This bill amends Code chapter 162, 14 which provides for the regulation of commercial establishments 15 that possess or control animals, other than animals used 16 for an agricultural purpose (Code section 162.1). The Code 17 chapter is administered and enforced by the department of 18 agriculture and land stewardship (DALS). DALS issues various 19 forms of authorizations according to the type of commercial 20 establishment regulated, with each type subject to a separate 21 fee (Code section 162.2B). An animal shelter, pound, or 22 research facility is issued a certificate of registration 23 (Code sections 162.3, 162.4, and 162.4A); a pet shop, boarding 24 kennel, or commercial kennel is issued a state license (Code 25 sections 162.5, 162.5A, and 162.6); and a dealer, commercial 26 breeder, or public auction may elect to be issued a state 27 license or a permit. However, in order to be issued a permit, 28 the dealer, commercial breeder, or public auction must be 29 licensed under the federal Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. ch. 54) 30 by the United States department of agriculture (USDA) (Code 31 sections 162.7, 162.8, and 162.9A). 32 BACKGROUND ââ REQUIREMENTS. A registrant or state licensee 33 (registrant/state licensee) is required to maintain business 34 records (records) while a permittee may but is not required 35 -4- LSB 1906YH (3) 91 da/ns 4/ 6 H.F. 474 to maintain those records. The Code chapter requires that a 1 commercial establishment must ensure that an animal in its 2 possession or under its control is provided a minimum standard 3 of care (adequate feed, adequate water, housing facilities, 4 sanitary control, grooming, and veterinary care) (Code section 5 162.10A). A commercial establishment must comply with DALSâ 6 rules. However, the standard of care for a permittee cannot be 7 more restrictive than the federal Animal Welfare Act. 8 BACKGROUND ââ ENTERING ONTO THE BUSINESS PREMISES OF A 9 COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENT. DALS may inspect a registrant/state 10 licensee by entering onto its business premises and may inspect 11 its records (Code section 162.10B). Alternatively, DALS may 12 monitor a permittee by entering onto its business premises 13 for the limited purpose of determining whether the permittee 14 is providing for the required standard of care (Code section 15 162.10C). In order to enter onto the premises of a permittee, 16 DALS must have reasonable cause supported by an oral or written 17 complaint or a report filed by the USDA. 18 BACKGROUND ââ REGULATION OF COMMERCIAL BREEDERS. A 19 commercial establishment that possesses or controls dogs 20 or cats as a commercial breeder operates either as a 21 registrant/state licensee or permittee. A commercial breeder 22 is a person engaged in the business of breeding dogs or cats, 23 or who sells, exchanges, or leases dogs or cats, in return 24 for consideration. However, an exception applies to exclude 25 a person who owns or harbors three or fewer breeding males or 26 females (Code section 162.2). 27 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INSPECTION OR MONITORING OF COMMERCIAL 28 ESTABLISHMENTS OPERATING AS A REGISTRANT/STATE LICENSEE OR 29 PERMITTEE. The bill provides for inspecting a commercial 30 establishment operated by a registrant/state licensee, or 31 monitoring a commercial establishment operated by a permittee, 32 on both a priority and scheduled basis. DALS inspects or 33 monitors a commercial establishment on a priority basis 34 according to its criteria, which is the same process that 35 -5- LSB 1906YH (3) 91 da/ns 5/ 6 H.F. 474 exists under current law, with one exception. If DALS enters 1 onto the business premises of a commercial establishment, 2 it must determine whether the registrant/state licensee or 3 permittee is complying with the respective standard of care 4 requirements. For inspecting or monitoring a commercial 5 establishment on a scheduled basis, DALS must enter onto the 6 business premises of each commercial establishment operating 7 as a commercial breeder (state licensee or permittee) once 8 each 12-month period to determine compliance with applicable 9 standard of care requirements. There is no reasonable cause 10 requirement that must support DALSâ entry onto the permitteeâs 11 commercial establishment. 12 APPLICABLE PENALTIES. DALS is authorized to establish, 13 impose, and assess a civil penalty of not more than $500 for 14 a violation of the Code chapter by a commercial establishment 15 subject to registration/state license or permit (Code 16 section 162.12A). DALS may also suspend or revoke the 17 registration/state license or permit (Code section 162.10D). 18 -6- LSB 1906YH (3) 91 da/ns 6/ 6
