The bill also provides that such structures shall 26 be treated similarly to agricultural structures constructed 27 before January 1, 2026, when applying any equalization order 28 of the department of revenue. 29 The bill modifies the list of examples of abnormal property 30 transactions that are to be excluded from consideration or 31 adjusted to eliminate distortions of market value when valuing 32 property to include built-to-suit construction, sale-leaseback 33 transactions, leased fee sales, and instead of sales to 34 immediate family, sales between related parties. 35 -70- LSB 2982YC (1) 91 jm/md 70/ 76 H.F. _____ Code section 441.21(4) establishes the calculation for 1 assessment limitations (rollback) for residential property and 2 agricultural property. The bill strikes the calculation of 3 the residential property assessment limitation for assessment 4 years beginning on or after January 1, 2025, and strikes 5 the provision within the agricultural property assessment 6 limitation calculation that limits growth of residential or 7 agricultural property to the growth in the other classification 8 (ag-residential tie). The bill provides that residential 9 property is assessed at 100 percent of the propertyâs actual 10 value for assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 11 2025. By operation of law and through changes in the bill, 12 all other classifications of property, except for agricultural 13 property, are assessed at 100 percent of actual value for 14 assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. 15 The bill modifies provisions governing the calculation 16 of payments made to local governments under Code section 17 441.21(5)(e) that are made to replace property taxes due to the 18 application of the residential property assessment limitation 19 to certain portions of commercial and industrial property 20 valuations and eliminates the appropriation for such payments 21 for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2026, due to 22 elimination of the assessment limitations. 23 The bill also reestablishes a multiresidential property 24 classification for assessment years beginning on or after 25 January 1, 2025, that includes types of property that were 26 classified as multiresidential property for assessment years 27 beginning before January 1, 2022. Such property is included 28 within the residential property classification under current 29 law. Under the bill, for purposes of equalization under Code 30 sections 441.47 through 441.49, multiresidential property shall 31 be considered residential property. 32 This division of the bill applies retroactively to 33 assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. 34 DIVISION V ââ DISABLED VETERAN AND HOMESTEAD CREDITS AND 35 -71- LSB 2982YC (1) 91 jm/md 71/ 76 H.F. _____ EXEMPTIONS. Starting with the assessment year beginning 1 January 1, 2025, the bill replaces the homestead property 2 tax credit, other than the portion of the credit provided 3 to certain disabled veterans, with a homestead property tax 4 exemption. For assessment years beginning on or after January 5 1, 2025, the exemption amount is $50,000 in taxable value. The 6 bill specifies that the elderly homestead exemption of $6,500 7 in taxable value applies in addition to the $50,000 homestead 8 exemption established in the bill. 9 The bill moves the disabled veteran homestead credit from 10 Code section 425.15 to Code section 425.1, and makes changes 11 to the scope of the disabled veteran homestead credit for new 12 applicants. Currently, a disabled veteran with a 100 percent 13 permanent and total disability rating receives a homestead 14 credit on the entire amount of tax levied on the homestead. 15 The bill specifies that a separate application form is required 16 to claim the disabled veteran homestead credit. The bill 17 does not change the homestead credit for an eligible disabled 18 veteran who makes an application for the homestead credit 19 before July 1, 2025. For a disabled veteran who makes an 20 application for the homestead credit on or after July 1, 2025, 21 the bill changes the definition of âhomesteadâ to exclude 22 appurtenances and limits the size of the homestead credit to 23 property on one-half acre. 24 The state continues to reimburse local governments for the 25 homestead credit, which for assessment years beginning on or 26 after January 1, 2025, includes only the disabled veterans 27 homestead credit, but does not reimburse local governments for 28 the homestead exemption under current law and in the bill. 29 The bill provides that homestead owners who have filed for 30 or who are receiving homestead credits or exemptions before 31 the effective date of this division of the bill shall continue 32 to receive such credits and exemptions for which the owner is 33 eligible for assessment years beginning on or after January 34 1, 2025, without refiling, and, if the owner is eligible, 35 -72- LSB 2982YC (1) 91 jm/md 72/ 76 H.F. _____ shall receive the exemption under Code section 425.1A(1A), as 1 enacted in this division of the bill, without filing for such 2 exemption. 3 This division of the bill applies retroactively to 4 assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. 5 DIVISION VI ââ MILITARY SERVICE PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION. 6 Under current law, a veteran receives a property tax exemption 7 of $4,000 in taxable value on property owned by the veteran. 8 The bill increases the veterans property tax exemption from 9 $4,000 to the following exemption amounts: for the assessment 10 year beginning January 1, 2025, $5,000; for the assessment year 11 beginning January 1, 2026, $6,000; and for assessment years 12 beginning on or after January 1, 2027, $7,000. 13 The division applies retroactively to assessment years 14 beginning on or after January 1, 2025. 15 DIVISION VII ââ HOSPITAL AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES 16 PROPERTY TAX LEVIES. The bill provides that for fiscal years 17 beginning on or after July 1, 2026, any property tax levy 18 imposed for a county hospital under Code chapter 347 that 19 is limited by law to a specific property tax levy rate per 20 $1,000 of assessed value shall not exceed a levy rate per 21 $1,000 of assessed value that is equal to 1,000 multiplied by 22 the quotient obtained by dividing the product of the budget 23 adjustment factor multiplied by the current fiscal yearâs 24 actual property tax dollars certified for such levy by the 25 remainder of the total assessed value used to calculate such 26 taxes for the budget year minus value attributable to new 27 valuation. The bill defines âbudget adjustment factorâ, 28 âbudget yearâ, and âcurrent fiscal yearâ to mean the same as 29 defined in Code section 331.423, as amended in the bill. 30 The bill establishes similar limitations for levies imposed 31 under Code chapters 347A (county hospitals payable from 32 revenue), 357F (emergency medical services districts), 357G 33 (city emergency medical services districts), and 422D (optional 34 taxes for emergency medical services) that are limited by law 35 -73- LSB 2982YC (1) 91 jm/md 73/ 76 H.F. _____ to a specific property tax levy rate per $1,000 of assessed 1 value. 2 DIVISION VIII ââ PROPERTY TAX LEVY RATES. The bill 3 establishes a reduction for rate-limited property tax levies. 4 The bill defines ârate-limited property tax levyâ to be any ad 5 valorem property tax levy limited by law to a specific property 6 tax levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value used to calculate 7 taxes, but does not include the school district foundation 8 levy under Code section 257.3, the county general services 9 levy under Code section 331.423(1), the county rural services 10 levy under Code section 331.423(2), the city general fund levy 11 under Code section 384.1(3), the physical plant and equipment 12 levies under Code section 298.2, the school district bond 13 tax under Code section 298.18, any levy under Code chapter 14 347 or 347A, and any levy under Code chapter 357F, 357G, or 15 422D. In addition, ârate-limited property tax levyâ does not 16 include levy rates used in the calculations under Code section 17 312.2(5)(a). 18 For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2026, each 19 rate-limited property tax levy may only be imposed if the 20 governmental entity imposed such levy for the fiscal year 21 beginning July 1, 2025, and shall, by operation of the bill, 22 be limited to a levy rate that is equal to 1,000 multiplied 23 by the quotient of 102 percent of the current fiscal yearâs 24 actual property tax dollars certified for such levy divided 25 by the total assessed value used to calculate such taxes for 26 the budget year, but not less than a levy rate per $1,000 of 27 assessed value that results in an amount of actual property tax 28 dollars certified for levy for such levy equal to 100.5 percent 29 of the actual property tax dollars certified for such levy for 30 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025. 31 For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2027, and each fiscal 32 year thereafter, rate-limited property tax levies may be 33 imposed by any governmental entity otherwise authorized by law, 34 regardless of whether the governmental entity imposed the levy 35 -74- LSB 2982YC (1) 91 jm/md 74/ 76 H.F. _____ for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025, at rates not to 1 exceed those established by the general assembly by statute 2 following receipt and consideration of the report submitted by 3 the legislative interim committee requested to be established 4 by the legislative council in this division of the bill. 5 The bill also provides that, on or after July 1, 2025, a city 6 or county shall not issue bonds or other indebtedness payable 7 from an ad valorem property tax levy for the purpose of funding 8 the general operations of the city or general operations of 9 the county, as applicable, or otherwise use proceeds from the 10 sale of bonds or issuance of other indebtedness to fund general 11 operations. The bill defines âgeneral operationsâ to mean 12 services or activities generally funded from the governmental 13 entityâs general fund, which are necessary for the operation 14 of the governmental entity, including salaries and benefits, 15 or which are for the health and welfare of the governmental 16 entityâs citizens or primarily intended to benefit all 17 residents of the governmental entity, but excluding services 18 financed by statutory funds other than a debt service fund. 19 The city finance committee is required to adopt rules under 20 Code chapter 17A for cities to implement the new Code section 21 governing funding of general operations. The county finance 22 committee is required to adopt rules under Code chapter 17A for 23 counties to implement the new Code section governing funding 24 of general operations. 25 The bill updates the calculation methodologies for 26 agricultural extension levies under Code section 176A.10 and 27 reduces levy rates used to make certain calculations related to 28 the secondary road fund allocations under Code section 312.2. 29 The bill requests the legislative council to establish 30 a legislative study committee during the 2025 legislative 31 interim to examine appropriate rates of property taxation 32 imposed by governmental entities following enactment of 33 the bill. The study committee shall consist of six voting 34 members of the general assembly. Two members shall be 35 -75- LSB 2982YC (1) 91 jm/md 75/ 76 H.F. _____ appointed by the majority leader of the senate, one member 1 appointed by the minority member of the senate, two members 2 appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives, 3 and one member appointed by the minority leader of the house 4 of representatives. The study committee is required to make 5 recommendations to the general assembly by January 15, 2026. 6 DIVISION IX ââ ELDERLY PROPERTY TAXES ââ LOW INCOME. The 7 bill modifies the eligibility for the property tax credit for 8 persons ages 70 and older under Code chapter 425, subchapter 9 II. Currently, a person filing a claim for the property tax 10 credit who is at least 70 years of age and who has a household 11 income of less than 250 percent of the federal poverty level is 12 eligible to receive a specified credit amount against property 13 taxes due on the claimantâs homestead. The bill increases the 14 household income threshold for eligibility from less than 250 15 percent of the federal poverty level to less than 350 percent 16 of the federal poverty level. 17 The division applies to assessment years beginning on or 18 after January 1, 2026. 19 DIVISION X ââ BRUCELLOSIS AND TUBERCULOSIS ERADICATION FUND 20 ââ LEVY. Code section 165.18 authorizes the secretary of 21 agriculture to direct the board of supervisors of each county 22 to levy an amount sufficient to pay the expenses estimated to 23 be incurred from the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication 24 fund for the following fiscal year, subject to a maximum levy 25 of 33.75 cents per $1,000.

This division of this Act applies 2 to property taxes due and payable in fiscal years beginning on 3 or after July 1, 2025. 4 EXPLANATION 5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 6 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 7 This bill relates to local government property taxes, 8 financial authority, and budgets. 9 DIVISION I ââ COUNTY PROPERTY TAXES AND BUDGETS. Code 10 section 331.423 establishes a levy rate limitation for the 11 general county services levy and a limitation for the rural 12 county services levy. The bill modifies the general county 13 services levy rate limitation for the fiscal year beginning 14 July 1, 2026, to be a levy rate not to exceed the greater of: 15 (1) a levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value equal to 1,000 16 multiplied by the quotient of 102 percent of the current fiscal 17 yearâs (immediately preceding fiscal year) actual property tax 18 dollars certified for levy for general county services divided 19 by the remainder of the total assessed value used to calculate 20 such taxes for the budget year minus value attributable to new 21 valuation, as defined in the bill; and (2) a levy rate per 22 $1,000 of assessed value that results in an amount of actual 23 property tax dollars certified for levy for general county 24 services equal to 100.5 percent of the actual property tax 25 dollars certified for such levy for the current fiscal year. 26 For each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2027, 27 the maximum levy rate is the levy rate imposed by the county 28 for the current fiscal year unless the total assessed value, 29 excluding new valuation, used to calculate taxes for general 30 county services for the budget year is equal to or exceeds 102 31 percent of the total assessed value used to calculate taxes for 32 general county services for the current fiscal year, and for 33 the budget year beginning July 1, 2027, only, not less than 34 a levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value that results in an 35 -64- LSB 2982YC (1) 91 jm/md 64/ 76 H.F. _____ amount of actual property tax dollars certified for levy equal 1 to 100.5 percent of the actual property tax dollars certified 2 for levy for the current fiscal year. 3 If the total assessed value, excluding value attributable 4 to new valuation, used to calculate taxes for general county 5 services for the budget year is equal to or exceeds 102 percent 6 of the total assessed value used to calculate taxes for general 7 county services for the current fiscal year, the levy rate 8 imposed shall not exceed a levy rate per $1,000 of assessed 9 value that is equal to 1,000 multiplied by the quotient 10 obtained by dividing the product of the budget adjustment 11 factor, as defined in the bill and which ranges from 102 12 percent to 105 percent depending upon the amount of annual 13 increase in the consumer price index, multiplied by the current 14 fiscal yearâs actual property tax dollars certified for levy 15 by the remainder of the total assessed value used to calculate 16 such taxes for the budget year minus value attributable to new 17 valuation. 18 The bill similarly modifies the maximum levy rate for rural 19 county services for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 20 2026. 21 The division takes effect January 1, 2026, and applies to 22 county taxes and budgets for fiscal years beginning on or after 23 July 1, 2026. 24 DIVISION II ââ CITY PROPERTY TAXES AND BUDGETS. Code 25 section 384.1 establishes the city general fund levy and limits 26 on the levy rate. The bill modifies the general fund levy 27 rate limitation for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2026, 28 to be a levy rate not to exceed the greater of: (1) a levy 29 rate per $1,000 of assessed value equal to 1,000 multiplied 30 by the quotient of 102 percent of the current fiscal yearâs 31 (immediately preceding fiscal year) actual property tax dollars 32 certified for levy divided by the remainder of the total 33 assessed value used to calculate such taxes for the budget year 34 minus value attributable to new valuation, as defined in the 35 -65- LSB 2982YC (1) 91 jm/md 65/ 76 H.F. _____ bill; and (2) a levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value that 1 results in an amount of actual property tax dollars certified 2 for levy equal to 100.5 percent of the actual property tax 3 dollars certified for such levy for the current fiscal year. 4 For each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2027, the 5 maximum levy rate is the levy rate imposed by the city for the 6 current fiscal year unless the total assessed value, excluding 7 new valuation, used to calculate taxes for the budget year is 8 equal to or exceeds 102 percent of the total assessed value 9 used to calculate taxes for the current fiscal year, and for 10 the budget year beginning July 1, 2027, only, not less than 11 a levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value that results in an 12 amount of actual property tax dollars certified for levy equal 13 to 100.5 percent of the actual property tax dollars certified 14 for levy for the current fiscal year. 15 If the total assessed value, excluding value attributable 16 to new valuation, used to calculate taxes for the city general 17 fund for the budget year is equal to or exceeds 102 percent 18 of the total assessed value used to calculate taxes for the 19 current fiscal year, the levy rate imposed shall not exceed a 20 levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value that is equal to 1,000 21 multiplied by the quotient obtained by dividing the product 22 of the budget adjustment factor, as defined in the bill and 23 which ranges from 102 percent to 105 percent depending upon 24 the amount of annual increase in the consumer price index, 25 multiplied by the current fiscal yearâs actual property tax 26 dollars certified for levy by the remainder of the total 27 assessed value used to calculate such taxes for the budget year 28 minus value attributable to new valuation. 29 The bill also establishes a methodology to determine a 30 maximum levy rate for a city that is not imposing a general 31 fund levy in the current fiscal year. 32 The division takes effect January 1, 2026, and applies to 33 property taxes and budgets for fiscal years beginning on or 34 after July 1, 2026. 35 -66- LSB 2982YC (1) 91 jm/md 66/ 76 H.F. _____ DIVISION III ââ SCHOOL TAXES AND BUDGETS. As part of 1 the state school foundation program, for school budget 2 years beginning on or after July 1, 2022, Code section 257.1 3 establishes the regular program foundation base to be 88.4 4 percent of the regular program state cost per pupil. Beginning 5 with the budget year beginning July 1, 2026, the bill increases 6 that percentage to 100 percent. Similarly, the bill increases 7 the special education support services foundation base 8 percentage from 79 percent to 100 percent. 9 Code section 257.3 requires school districts to levy a 10 foundation property tax of $5.40 per $1,000 of assessed value 11 on all taxable property in the school district. The bill 12 reduces the foundation property tax levy rate to $2.97 per 13 $1,000 of assessed value for budget years beginning on or after 14 July 1, 2026. 15 Code section 257.3 provides an exception to the foundation 16 property tax levy rate of $5.40 for those school districts that 17 have recently been reorganized. Such districts are provided 18 reduced foundation property tax levy rates for three years 19 following the reorganization. The bill adjusts those reduced 20 rates for reorganizations that take effect on or after July 21 1, 2026, to reflect the reduction made in the bill to the 22 foundation property tax levy imposed by school districts that 23 are not subject to a reorganization and eliminates certain 24 supplemental aid related to such reorganized school district 25 rates for budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2026. 26 The bill eliminates certain property tax adjustment aid 27 under Code section 257.15(2) and (3) for fiscal years beginning 28 on or after July 1, 2026. 29 The bill eliminates the $24 million general fund 30 appropriation for adjusted additional property tax levy aid 31 under Code section 257.15(4) for fiscal years beginning on 32 or after July 1, 2026. The bill also eliminates the annual 33 appropriation of the balance of the property tax equity and 34 relief fund under Code section 257.16A for purposes designated 35 -67- LSB 2982YC (1) 91 jm/md 67/ 76 H.F. _____ under Code section 257.15(4) and requires remaining moneys at 1 the end of a specified fiscal year to be transferred back to 2 the funds from which they were received. 3 The bill eliminates the payment of school district property 4 tax replacement payments for fiscal years beginning on or after 5 July 1, 2026. 6 The bill eliminates the annual appropriation of moneys in 7 the foundation base supplement fund for fiscal years beginning 8 on or after July 1, 2026, and requires the remaining moneys 9 at the end of a specified fiscal year to be transferred for 10 deposit in the secure an advanced vision for education fund. 11 The bill eliminates transfers from the secure an advanced 12 vision for education fund to the property tax equity and relief 13 fund and the foundation base supplement fund for fiscal years 14 beginning on or after July 1, 2026. 15 In Code chapters 425A (family farm tax credit) and 426 16 (agricultural land tax credit), the bill replaces references 17 to the school foundation property tax levy rate ($5.40) with 18 citations to the appropriate provision of the Code section 19 establishing the foundation property tax rate. 20 The bill requires each school district with an unexpended 21 fund balance in the districtâs management levy fund under 22 Code section 298A.3 at the conclusion of the fiscal year 23 beginning July 1, 2024, that exceeds an amount equal to the 24 total expenditures from the districtâs management fund for the 25 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024, to certify such unexpended 26 fund balance and expenditure amounts, including any reserved 27 or designated amounts in the fund and the purposes therefor, 28 to the school budget review committee by November 15, 2025. 29 The committee is then required to conduct a review of the 30 unexpended fund balances and expenditures of school district 31 management levy funds certified under the bill. By February 32 1, 2026, the committee shall make recommendations to the 33 general assembly for establishing district management levy fund 34 unexpended fund balance limitations for fiscal years beginning 35 -68- LSB 2982YC (1) 91 jm/md 68/ 76 H.F. _____ on or after July 1, 2027, including recommendations for 1 limitations based on a percentage of the districtâs management 2 levy fund expenditures and recommendations for management levy 3 limitations and expenditure requirements for excess funds. 4 The bill amends several provisions relating to the state 5 school foundation program funding formula to include funding 6 for the media services funding and educational services funding 7 under Code section 257.37 to be included and funded as part of 8 foundation aid paid by the state instead of funding through a 9 school districtâs additional property tax under Code section 10 257.4 for school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 11 2026. 12 The bill reduces by 50 percent the maximum levy rates for 13 the regular and voter-approved physical plant and equipment 14 levy under Code section 298.2 and the school district bond tax 15 under Code section 298.18. The bill also repeals an obsolete 16 provision relating to levy adjustments authorized to occur 17 before June 30, 2007, in Code section 298.18A. 18 The bill also amends Code section 298.4 by providing that for 19 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2027, if a school 20 districtâs unexpended fund balance of the districtâs management 21 levy fund is equal to or exceeds a specified percentage of the 22 average annual expenditures from the districtâs management 23 levy fund for the three consecutive fiscal years immediately 24 preceding the base year, the board of directors may not certify 25 a district management levy for the fiscal year. Additionally, 26 if a school district is not prohibited from certifying a levy 27 under the bill, the maximum amount that the board of directors 28 may certify for levy under the district management levy shall 29 be an amount equal to the remainder of a specified percentage 30 of the average annual expenditures from the districtâs 31 management levy fund for the three consecutive fiscal years 32 immediately preceding the base year minus the districtâs 33 management levy fund unexpended fund balance for the fiscal 34 year preceding the base year. 35 -69- LSB 2982YC (1) 91 jm/md 69/ 76 H.F. _____ Except for the section of the division amending Code section 1 257.31, which relates to the school budget review committee, 2 this division of the bill takes effect January 1, 2026, and 3 applies to fiscal years and school budget years beginning on 4 or after July 1, 2026. 5 DIVISION IV ââ PROPERTY VALUATIONS AND ASSESSMENT 6 LIMITATIONS. Code section 441.21 provides that the actual 7 value of agricultural property shall be determined on the 8 basis of productivity and net earning capacity and that any 9 formula or method employed to determine productivity and net 10 earning capacity of property shall be adopted in full by rule 11 of the department of revenue. The bill amends that provision 12 by specifying that for assessment years beginning on or after 13 January 1, 2026, structures on agricultural land constructed on 14 or after January 1, 2026, that are not agricultural dwellings 15 shall not be included in determination of productivity and 16 net earning capacity of agricultural property and shall not 17 be allocated any portion of the total county productivity 18 value so determined. Such agricultural structures shall 19 instead be valued according to the structureâs replacement 20 cost less depreciation and obsolescence and the structureâs 21 assessed value subject to taxation prior to application of 22 any assessment limitation shall be equal to the product of 23 the structureâs value multiplied by the agricultural factor, 24 as determined in 701 IAC 102.3(2) or succeeding rule of the 25 department. The bill also provides that such structures shall 26 be treated similarly to agricultural structures constructed 27 before January 1, 2026, when applying any equalization order 28 of the department of revenue. 29 The bill modifies the list of examples of abnormal property 30 transactions that are to be excluded from consideration or 31 adjusted to eliminate distortions of market value when valuing 32 property to include built-to-suit construction, sale-leaseback 33 transactions, leased fee sales, and instead of sales to 34 immediate family, sales between related parties. 35 -70- LSB 2982YC (1) 91 jm/md 70/ 76 H.F. _____ Code section 441.21(4) establishes the calculation for 1 assessment limitations (rollback) for residential property and 2 agricultural property. The bill strikes the calculation of 3 the residential property assessment limitation for assessment 4 years beginning on or after January 1, 2025, and strikes 5 the provision within the agricultural property assessment 6 limitation calculation that limits growth of residential or 7 agricultural property to the growth in the other classification 8 (ag-residential tie). The bill provides that residential 9 property is assessed at 100 percent of the propertyâs actual 10 value for assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 11 2025. By operation of law and through changes in the bill, 12 all other classifications of property, except for agricultural 13 property, are assessed at 100 percent of actual value for 14 assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. 15 The bill modifies provisions governing the calculation 16 of payments made to local governments under Code section 17 441.21(5)(e) that are made to replace property taxes due to the 18 application of the residential property assessment limitation 19 to certain portions of commercial and industrial property 20 valuations and eliminates the appropriation for such payments 21 for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2026, due to 22 elimination of the assessment limitations. 23 The bill also reestablishes a multiresidential property 24 classification for assessment years beginning on or after 25 January 1, 2025, that includes types of property that were 26 classified as multiresidential property for assessment years 27 beginning before January 1, 2022. Such property is included 28 within the residential property classification under current 29 law. Under the bill, for purposes of equalization under Code 30 sections 441.47 through 441.49, multiresidential property shall 31 be considered residential property. 32 This division of the bill applies retroactively to 33 assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. 34 DIVISION V ââ DISABLED VETERAN AND HOMESTEAD CREDITS AND 35 -71- LSB 2982YC (1) 91 jm/md 71/ 76 H.F. _____ EXEMPTIONS. Starting with the assessment year beginning 1 January 1, 2025, the bill replaces the homestead property 2 tax credit, other than the portion of the credit provided 3 to certain disabled veterans, with a homestead property tax 4 exemption. For assessment years beginning on or after January 5 1, 2025, the exemption amount is $50,000 in taxable value. The 6 bill specifies that the elderly homestead exemption of $6,500 7 in taxable value applies in addition to the $50,000 homestead 8 exemption established in the bill. 9 The bill moves the disabled veteran homestead credit from 10 Code section 425.15 to Code section 425.1, and makes changes 11 to the scope of the disabled veteran homestead credit for new 12 applicants. Currently, a disabled veteran with a 100 percent 13 permanent and total disability rating receives a homestead 14 credit on the entire amount of tax levied on the homestead. 15 The bill specifies that a separate application form is required 16 to claim the disabled veteran homestead credit. The bill 17 does not change the homestead credit for an eligible disabled 18 veteran who makes an application for the homestead credit 19 before July 1, 2025. For a disabled veteran who makes an 20 application for the homestead credit on or after July 1, 2025, 21 the bill changes the definition of âhomesteadâ to exclude 22 appurtenances and limits the size of the homestead credit to 23 property on one-half acre. 24 The state continues to reimburse local governments for the 25 homestead credit, which for assessment years beginning on or 26 after January 1, 2025, includes only the disabled veterans 27 homestead credit, but does not reimburse local governments for 28 the homestead exemption under current law and in the bill. 29 The bill provides that homestead owners who have filed for 30 or who are receiving homestead credits or exemptions before 31 the effective date of this division of the bill shall continue 32 to receive such credits and exemptions for which the owner is 33 eligible for assessment years beginning on or after January 34 1, 2025, without refiling, and, if the owner is eligible, 35 -72- LSB 2982YC (1) 91 jm/md 72/ 76 H.F. _____ shall receive the exemption under Code section 425.1A(1A), as 1 enacted in this division of the bill, without filing for such 2 exemption. 3 This division of the bill applies retroactively to 4 assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. 5 DIVISION VI ââ MILITARY SERVICE PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION. 6 Under current law, a veteran receives a property tax exemption 7 of $4,000 in taxable value on property owned by the veteran. 8 The bill increases the veterans property tax exemption from 9 $4,000 to the following exemption amounts: for the assessment 10 year beginning January 1, 2025, $5,000; for the assessment year 11 beginning January 1, 2026, $6,000; and for assessment years 12 beginning on or after January 1, 2027, $7,000. 13 The division applies retroactively to assessment years 14 beginning on or after January 1, 2025. 15 DIVISION VII ââ HOSPITAL AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES 16 PROPERTY TAX LEVIES. The bill provides that for fiscal years 17 beginning on or after July 1, 2026, any property tax levy 18 imposed for a county hospital under Code chapter 347 that 19 is limited by law to a specific property tax levy rate per 20 $1,000 of assessed value shall not exceed a levy rate per 21 $1,000 of assessed value that is equal to 1,000 multiplied by 22 the quotient obtained by dividing the product of the budget 23 adjustment factor multiplied by the current fiscal yearâs 24 actual property tax dollars certified for such levy by the 25 remainder of the total assessed value used to calculate such 26 taxes for the budget year minus value attributable to new 27 valuation. The bill defines âbudget adjustment factorâ, 28 âbudget yearâ, and âcurrent fiscal yearâ to mean the same as 29 defined in Code section 331.423, as amended in the bill. 30 The bill establishes similar limitations for levies imposed 31 under Code chapters 347A (county hospitals payable from 32 revenue), 357F (emergency medical services districts), 357G 33 (city emergency medical services districts), and 422D (optional 34 taxes for emergency medical services) that are limited by law 35 -73- LSB 2982YC (1) 91 jm/md 73/ 76 H.F. _____ to a specific property tax levy rate per $1,000 of assessed 1 value. 2 DIVISION VIII ââ PROPERTY TAX LEVY RATES. The bill 3 establishes a reduction for rate-limited property tax levies. 4 The bill defines ârate-limited property tax levyâ to be any ad 5 valorem property tax levy limited by law to a specific property 6 tax levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value used to calculate 7 taxes, but does not include the school district foundation 8 levy under Code section 257.3, the county general services 9 levy under Code section 331.423(1), the county rural services 10 levy under Code section 331.423(2), the city general fund levy 11 under Code section 384.1(3), the physical plant and equipment 12 levies under Code section 298.2, the school district bond 13 tax under Code section 298.18, any levy under Code chapter 14 347 or 347A, and any levy under Code chapter 357F, 357G, or 15 422D. In addition, ârate-limited property tax levyâ does not 16 include levy rates used in the calculations under Code section 17 312.2(5)(a). 18 For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2026, each 19 rate-limited property tax levy may only be imposed if the 20 governmental entity imposed such levy for the fiscal year 21 beginning July 1, 2025, and shall, by operation of the bill, 22 be limited to a levy rate that is equal to 1,000 multiplied 23 by the quotient of 102 percent of the current fiscal yearâs 24 actual property tax dollars certified for such levy divided 25 by the total assessed value used to calculate such taxes for 26 the budget year, but not less than a levy rate per $1,000 of 27 assessed value that results in an amount of actual property tax 28 dollars certified for levy for such levy equal to 100.5 percent 29 of the actual property tax dollars certified for such levy for 30 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025. 31 For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2027, and each fiscal 32 year thereafter, rate-limited property tax levies may be 33 imposed by any governmental entity otherwise authorized by law, 34 regardless of whether the governmental entity imposed the levy 35 -74- LSB 2982YC (1) 91 jm/md 74/ 76 H.F. _____ for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025, at rates not to 1 exceed those established by the general assembly by statute 2 following receipt and consideration of the report submitted by 3 the legislative interim committee requested to be established 4 by the legislative council in this division of the bill. 5 The bill also provides that, on or after July 1, 2025, a city 6 or county shall not issue bonds or other indebtedness payable 7 from an ad valorem property tax levy for the purpose of funding 8 the general operations of the city or general operations of 9 the county, as applicable, or otherwise use proceeds from the 10 sale of bonds or issuance of other indebtedness to fund general 11 operations. The bill defines âgeneral operationsâ to mean 12 services or activities generally funded from the governmental 13 entityâs general fund, which are necessary for the operation 14 of the governmental entity, including salaries and benefits, 15 or which are for the health and welfare of the governmental 16 entityâs citizens or primarily intended to benefit all 17 residents of the governmental entity, but excluding services 18 financed by statutory funds other than a debt service fund. 19 The city finance committee is required to adopt rules under 20 Code chapter 17A for cities to implement the new Code section 21 governing funding of general operations. The county finance 22 committee is required to adopt rules under Code chapter 17A for 23 counties to implement the new Code section governing funding 24 of general operations. 25 The bill updates the calculation methodologies for 26 agricultural extension levies under Code section 176A.10 and 27 reduces levy rates used to make certain calculations related to 28 the secondary road fund allocations under Code section 312.2. 29 The bill requests the legislative council to establish 30 a legislative study committee during the 2025 legislative 31 interim to examine appropriate rates of property taxation 32 imposed by governmental entities following enactment of 33 the bill. The study committee shall consist of six voting 34 members of the general assembly. Two members shall be 35 -75- LSB 2982YC (1) 91 jm/md 75/ 76 H.F. _____ appointed by the majority leader of the senate, one member 1 appointed by the minority member of the senate, two members 2 appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives, 3 and one member appointed by the minority leader of the house 4 of representatives. The study committee is required to make 5 recommendations to the general assembly by January 15, 2026. 6 DIVISION IX ââ ELDERLY PROPERTY TAXES ââ LOW INCOME.
