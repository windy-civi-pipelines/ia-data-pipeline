Senate Resolution 1 - Introduced SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 1 BY COMMITTEE ON ETHICS (SUCCESSOR TO SSB 1020) A Resolution relating to the Senate Code of Ethics 1 governing the conduct of members of the Senate in 2 relation to their senatorial duties during the 3 Ninety-first General Assembly. 4 BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE, That the Senate Code 5 of Ethics for the Ninetieth Ninety-first General 6 Assembly shall be amended to read as follows: 7 SENATE CODE OF ETHICS 8 PREAMBLE. Every legislator owes a duty to uphold 9 the integrity and honor of the general assembly, to 10 encourage respect for the law and for the general 11 assembly and the members thereof, and to observe the 12 legislative code of ethics. 13 In doing so, members of the senate have a duty to 14 conduct themselves so as to reflect credit on the 15 general assembly, and to inspire the confidence, 16 respect, and trust of the public, and to strive to 17 avoid both unethical and illegal conduct and the 18 appearance of unethical and illegal conduct. 19 Recognizing that service in the Iowa general 20 assembly is a part-time endeavor and that members of 21 the general assembly are honorable individuals who 22 are active in the affairs of their localities and 23 elsewhere and that it is necessary that they maintain 24 a livelihood and source of income apart from their 25 legislative compensation, the following rules are 26 adopted pursuant to section 68B.31, to assist the 27 -1- LSB 1535SV (2) 91 th/jh 1/ 26 S.R. 1 members in the conduct of their legislative affairs. 1 1. ECONOMIC INTEREST OF SENATOR. Taking into 2 account that legislative service is part-time, a 3 senator shall not accept economic or investment 4 opportunity, under circumstances where the senator 5 knows, or should know, that there is a reasonable 6 possibility that the opportunity is being afforded the 7 senator with intent to influence the senatorâs conduct 8 in the performance of official duties. 9 2. DIVESTITURE. Where a senator learns that 10 an economic or investment opportunity previously 11 accepted was offered with the intent of influencing 12 the senatorâs conduct in the performance of official 13 duties, the senator shall take steps to divest that 14 senator of that investment or economic opportunity, and 15 shall report the facts of the situation to the senate 16 ethics committee. 17 3. CHARGES FOR SERVICES. A senator shall not 18 charge to or accept from a person, corporation, 19 partnership, or association known to have a legislative 20 interest a price, fee, compensation, or other 21 consideration for the sale or lease of any property or 22 the furnishing of services which is in excess of that 23 which the senator would charge another. 24 4. USE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. A senator in 25 order to further the senatorâs own economic or other 26 interests, or those of any other person, shall not 27 disclose or use confidential information acquired in 28 the course of official duties. 29 5. HONORARIA. A senator shall not accept an 30 -2- LSB 1535SV (2) 91 th/jh 2/ 26 S.R. 1 honorarium from a restricted donor for a speech, 1 writing for publication, or other similar activity, 2 except as otherwise provided in section 68B.23. 3 6. EMPLOYMENT. A senator shall not accept 4 employment, either directly or indirectly, from a 5 political action committee or from an organization 6 exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(4), 7 501(c)(6), or 527 of the Internal Revenue Code that 8 engages in activities related to the nomination, 9 election, or defeat of a candidate for public office. 10 A senator may accept employment from a political 11 party, but shall disclose the employment relationship 12 in writing to the secretary of the senate within ten 13 days after the beginning of each legislative session. 14 If a senator accepts employment from a political 15 party during a legislative session, the senator shall 16 disclose the employment relationship within ten days 17 after acceptance of the employment. 18 For the purpose of this rule, a political action 19 committee means a committee, but not a candidateâs 20 committee, which accepts contributions, makes 21 expenditures, or incurs indebtedness in the aggregate 22 of more than one thousand dollars in any one calendar 23 year to expressly advocate the nomination, election, or 24 defeat of a candidate for public office or to expressly 25 advocate the passage or defeat of a ballot issue or 26 influencing legislative action, or an association, 27 lodge, society, cooperative, union, fraternity, 28 sorority, educational institution, civic organization, 29 labor organization, religious organization, or 30 -3- LSB 1535SV (2) 91 th/jh 3/ 26 S.R. 1 professional organization which makes contributions in 1 the aggregate of more than one thousand dollars in any 2 one calendar year to expressly advocate the nomination, 3 election, or defeat of a candidate for public office or 4 ballot issue or influencing legislative action. 5 7. ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF LOBBYIST. With the 6 exception of exercising unfettered discretion in 7 supporting or refusing to support proposed legislation, 8 a senator shall not take action intended to affect the 9 economic interests of a lobbyist or citizen supporting 10 or opposing proposed legislation. 11 8. APPEARANCE BEFORE GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY. A 12 senator may appear before a governmental agency or 13 board in any representation case, except that the 14 senator shall not act as a lobbyist. Whenever a 15 senator appears before a governmental agency or board, 16 the senator shall carefully avoid all conduct which 17 might in any way lead members of the general public 18 to conclude that the senator is using the senatorâs 19 official position to further the senatorâs professional 20 success or personal financial interest. 21 9. CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS. In order to permit the 22 general assembly to function effectively, a senator 23 will sometimes be required to vote on bills and 24 participate in committee work which will affect the 25 senatorâs employment and other monetary interests. In 26 making a decision relative to the senatorâs activity on 27 given bills or committee work which are subject to the 28 code, the following factors shall be considered: 29 a. Whether a substantial threat to the senatorâs 30 -4- LSB 1535SV (2) 91 th/jh 4/ 26 S.R. 1 independence of judgment has been created by the 1 conflict situation. 2 b. The effect of the senatorâs participation on 3 public confidence in the integrity of the legislature. 4 c. The need for the senatorâs particular 5 contribution, such as special knowledge of the 6 subject matter, to the effective functioning of the 7 legislature. 8 10. GIFTS.

Raw Text:
Senate Resolution 1 - Introduced SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 1 BY COMMITTEE ON ETHICS (SUCCESSOR TO SSB 1020) A Resolution relating to the Senate Code of Ethics 1 governing the conduct of members of the Senate in 2 relation to their senatorial duties during the 3 Ninety-first General Assembly. 4 BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE, That the Senate Code 5 of Ethics for the Ninetieth Ninety-first General 6 Assembly shall be amended to read as follows: 7 SENATE CODE OF ETHICS 8 PREAMBLE. Every legislator owes a duty to uphold 9 the integrity and honor of the general assembly, to 10 encourage respect for the law and for the general 11 assembly and the members thereof, and to observe the 12 legislative code of ethics. 13 In doing so, members of the senate have a duty to 14 conduct themselves so as to reflect credit on the 15 general assembly, and to inspire the confidence, 16 respect, and trust of the public, and to strive to 17 avoid both unethical and illegal conduct and the 18 appearance of unethical and illegal conduct. 19 Recognizing that service in the Iowa general 20 assembly is a part-time endeavor and that members of 21 the general assembly are honorable individuals who 22 are active in the affairs of their localities and 23 elsewhere and that it is necessary that they maintain 24 a livelihood and source of income apart from their 25 legislative compensation, the following rules are 26 adopted pursuant to section 68B.31, to assist the 27 -1- LSB 1535SV (2) 91 th/jh 1/ 26 S.R. 1 members in the conduct of their legislative affairs. 1 1. ECONOMIC INTEREST OF SENATOR. Taking into 2 account that legislative service is part-time, a 3 senator shall not accept economic or investment 4 opportunity, under circumstances where the senator 5 knows, or should know, that there is a reasonable 6 possibility that the opportunity is being afforded the 7 senator with intent to influence the senatorâs conduct 8 in the performance of official duties. 9 2. DIVESTITURE. Where a senator learns that 10 an economic or investment opportunity previously 11 accepted was offered with the intent of influencing 12 the senatorâs conduct in the performance of official 13 duties, the senator shall take steps to divest that 14 senator of that investment or economic opportunity, and 15 shall report the facts of the situation to the senate 16 ethics committee. 17 3. CHARGES FOR SERVICES. A senator shall not 18 charge to or accept from a person, corporation, 19 partnership, or association known to have a legislative 20 interest a price, fee, compensation, or other 21 consideration for the sale or lease of any property or 22 the furnishing of services which is in excess of that 23 which the senator would charge another. 24 4. USE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. A senator in 25 order to further the senatorâs own economic or other 26 interests, or those of any other person, shall not 27 disclose or use confidential information acquired in 28 the course of official duties. 29 5. HONORARIA. A senator shall not accept an 30 -2- LSB 1535SV (2) 91 th/jh 2/ 26 S.R. 1 honorarium from a restricted donor for a speech, 1 writing for publication, or other similar activity, 2 except as otherwise provided in section 68B.23. 3 6. EMPLOYMENT. A senator shall not accept 4 employment, either directly or indirectly, from a 5 political action committee or from an organization 6 exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(4), 7 501(c)(6), or 527 of the Internal Revenue Code that 8 engages in activities related to the nomination, 9 election, or defeat of a candidate for public office. 10 A senator may accept employment from a political 11 party, but shall disclose the employment relationship 12 in writing to the secretary of the senate within ten 13 days after the beginning of each legislative session. 14 If a senator accepts employment from a political 15 party during a legislative session, the senator shall 16 disclose the employment relationship within ten days 17 after acceptance of the employment. 18 For the purpose of this rule, a political action 19 committee means a committee, but not a candidateâs 20 committee, which accepts contributions, makes 21 expenditures, or incurs indebtedness in the aggregate 22 of more than one thousand dollars in any one calendar 23 year to expressly advocate the nomination, election, or 24 defeat of a candidate for public office or to expressly 25 advocate the passage or defeat of a ballot issue or 26 influencing legislative action, or an association, 27 lodge, society, cooperative, union, fraternity, 28 sorority, educational institution, civic organization, 29 labor organization, religious organization, or 30 -3- LSB 1535SV (2) 91 th/jh 3/ 26 S.R. 1 professional organization which makes contributions in 1 the aggregate of more than one thousand dollars in any 2 one calendar year to expressly advocate the nomination, 3 election, or defeat of a candidate for public office or 4 ballot issue or influencing legislative action. 5 7. ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF LOBBYIST. With the 6 exception of exercising unfettered discretion in 7 supporting or refusing to support proposed legislation, 8 a senator shall not take action intended to affect the 9 economic interests of a lobbyist or citizen supporting 10 or opposing proposed legislation. 11 8. APPEARANCE BEFORE GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY. A 12 senator may appear before a governmental agency or 13 board in any representation case, except that the 14 senator shall not act as a lobbyist. Whenever a 15 senator appears before a governmental agency or board, 16 the senator shall carefully avoid all conduct which 17 might in any way lead members of the general public 18 to conclude that the senator is using the senatorâs 19 official position to further the senatorâs professional 20 success or personal financial interest. 21 9. CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS. In order to permit the 22 general assembly to function effectively, a senator 23 will sometimes be required to vote on bills and 24 participate in committee work which will affect the 25 senatorâs employment and other monetary interests. In 26 making a decision relative to the senatorâs activity on 27 given bills or committee work which are subject to the 28 code, the following factors shall be considered: 29 a. Whether a substantial threat to the senatorâs 30 -4- LSB 1535SV (2) 91 th/jh 4/ 26 S.R. 1 independence of judgment has been created by the 1 conflict situation. 2 b. The effect of the senatorâs participation on 3 public confidence in the integrity of the legislature. 4 c. The need for the senatorâs particular 5 contribution, such as special knowledge of the 6 subject matter, to the effective functioning of the 7 legislature. 8 10. GIFTS. Except as otherwise provided in section 9 68B.22, a senator, or that personâs immediate family 10 member, shall not, directly or indirectly, accept or 11 receive any gift or series of gifts from a restricted 12 donor. 13 11. DISCLOSURE REQUIRED BY SENATORS. Each senator 14 shall file with the secretary of the senate within ten 15 days after the adoption of the code of ethics by the 16 senate, and within ten days after the convening of the 17 second session of the general assembly, a financial 18 statement under section 68B.35 on forms provided by 19 the secretary of the senate setting forth the following 20 information: 21 The nature of each business in which the senator 22 is engaged and the nature of the business of each 23 company in which the senator has a financial interest. 24 A senator shall not be required to file a financial 25 statement or be assumed to have a financial interest 26 if the annual income derived from the investment 27 in stocks, bonds, bills, notes, mortgages, or other 28 securities offered for sale through recognized 29 financial brokers is less than one thousand dollars. 30 -5- LSB 1535SV (2) 91 th/jh 5/ 26 S.R. 1 Disclosures required under this rule shall be as 1 of the date filed unless provided to the contrary, 2 and shall be amended to include interests and changes 3 encompassed by this rule that occur while the general 4 assembly is in session.

The chairperson of the ethics 12 committee shall request in writing that a senator 13 who has failed to complete the financial statement or 14 appears to have filed an incomplete financial statement 15 do so within five days, and, upon the failure of the 16 senator to comply, the ethics committee shall require 17 the senator to appear before the committee. 18 11A. DISCLOSURE REQUIRED BY CANDIDATES FOR SENATE. 19 Each candidate for senate shall file with the secretary 20 of the senate within fourteen days after the deadline 21 for the filing of nomination papers or fourteen days 22 after the nominating convention, as applicable, a 23 financial statement under section 68B.35 on forms 24 provided by the secretary of the senate setting forth 25 the following information: 26 The nature of each business in which the candidate 27 for senate is engaged and the nature of the business 28 of each company in which the candidate for senate has a 29 financial interest. A candidate for senate shall not 30 -6- LSB 1535SV (2) 91 th/jh 6/ 26 S.R. 1 be required to file a financial statement or be assumed 1 to have a financial interest if the annual income 2 derived from the investment in stocks, bonds, bills, 3 notes, mortgages, or other securities offered for sale 4 through recognized financial brokers is less than one 5 thousand dollars. 6 Disclosures required under this rule shall be for 7 the year preceding the year in which the election is to 8 be held. All filings under this rule shall be open to 9 public inspection in the office of the secretary of the 10 senate at all reasonable times. 11 The secretary of the senate shall provide 12 information to persons interested in becoming 13 candidates for senate of the duty to file financial 14 statements under this rule and the applicable 15 deadlines. 16 The secretary of the senate shall inform the ethics 17 committee of the financial statements that are filed 18 and shall report to the ethics committee the names 19 of any candidates for senate who appear not to have 20 filed complete financial statements. The secretary of 21 the senate shall request that a candidate for senate 22 who has failed to complete the financial statement 23 or appears to have filed an incomplete financial 24 report to do so within five days. If a candidate for 25 senate does not file a complete financial statement 26 within five days, the candidate shall be fined fifty 27 dollars, payable to the Iowa senate for deposit in the 28 general fund, and the ethics committee may require the 29 candidate to appear before the committee. 30 -7- LSB 1535SV (2) 91 th/jh 7/ 26 S.R. 1 12.
