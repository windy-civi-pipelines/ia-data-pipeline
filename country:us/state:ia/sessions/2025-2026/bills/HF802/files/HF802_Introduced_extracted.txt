The bill amends 10 provisions relating to a manufacturerâs rights under the 11 Code chapter to also apply to eligible facilities. The bill 12 provides that a manufacturer of an investigational drug, 13 biological product, or device or a manufacturer operating 14 within, and in compliance with all requirements applicable 15 to, an eligible facility may make available, and an eligible 16 patient may request from a manufacturer of an investigational 17 drug, biological product, or device, or a manufacturer 18 operating within, and in compliance with all requirements 19 applicable to, an eligible facility, the manufacturerâs 20 investigational drug, biological product, or device, or the 21 manufacturerâs individualized investigational treatment. 22 However, the Code chapter does not require a manufacturer of 23 an individualized investigational treatment to provide or 24 otherwise make available the individualized investigational 25 treatment to an eligible patient. The bill provides that an 26 eligible facility or a manufacturer that is in compliance with 27 all applicable requirements may provide an individualized 28 investigational treatment to an eligible patient without 29 receiving compensation, or require an eligible patient to pay 30 the costs of, or the costs associated with, the manufacture of 31 the individualized investigational treatment. 32 The bill makes conforming changes in the Code chapter. 33 -9- LSB 1518HV (2) 91 lh/ko 9/ 9

This chapter shall not affect any mandatory health care 8 coverage for participation in clinical trials under Title XIII, 9 subtitle 1 . 10 EXPLANATION 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 12 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 13 This bill relates to Code chapter 144E, the right to try Act. 14 Under current law, an âeligible patientâ under the Code 15 chapter is, in part, a person who has a terminal illness. 16 Under the bill, an âeligible patientâ also includes an 17 individual who has a life-threatening or severely debilitating 18 illness, who has exhausted all other treatment options, who 19 has received a recommendation from the individualâs physician 20 for individualized investigational treatment, who has given 21 written informed consent, and who has documentation from 22 the individualâs physician that the individual meets these 23 requirements. 24 Under current law, the Code chapter applies to an 25 âinvestigational drug, biological product, or deviceâ, 26 meaning a drug, biological product, or device that has 27 successfully completed phase I of a United States food and 28 drug administration (FDA)-approved clinical trial but has not 29 yet been approved for general use by the FDA and that remains 30 under investigation in an FDA-approved clinical trial. Under 31 the bill, the Code chapter also applies to an âindividualized 32 investigational treatmentâ, meaning a drug, biological product, 33 or device that is unique to and produced exclusively for use 34 by an individual patient based on the individual patientâs 35 -8- LSB 1518HV (2) 91 lh/ko 8/ 9 H.F. 802 own genetic profile and includes individualized gene therapy, 1 antisense oligonucleotides, and individualized neoantigen 2 vaccines. 3 The bill amends the definition for âwritten informed 4 consentâ to reflect the changes made to âeligible patientâ 5 and the application of the Code chapter to individualized 6 investigational treatments. 7 âEligible facilityâ is defined as an institution that is 8 operating under a federalwide assurance for the protection 9 of human subjects pursuant to federal law. The bill amends 10 provisions relating to a manufacturerâs rights under the 11 Code chapter to also apply to eligible facilities. The bill 12 provides that a manufacturer of an investigational drug, 13 biological product, or device or a manufacturer operating 14 within, and in compliance with all requirements applicable 15 to, an eligible facility may make available, and an eligible 16 patient may request from a manufacturer of an investigational 17 drug, biological product, or device, or a manufacturer 18 operating within, and in compliance with all requirements 19 applicable to, an eligible facility, the manufacturerâs 20 investigational drug, biological product, or device, or the 21 manufacturerâs individualized investigational treatment. 22 However, the Code chapter does not require a manufacturer of 23 an individualized investigational treatment to provide or 24 otherwise make available the individualized investigational 25 treatment to an eligible patient. The bill provides that an 26 eligible facility or a manufacturer that is in compliance with 27 all applicable requirements may provide an individualized 28 investigational treatment to an eligible patient without 29 receiving compensation, or require an eligible patient to pay 30 the costs of, or the costs associated with, the manufacture of 31 the individualized investigational treatment. 32 The bill makes conforming changes in the Code chapter. 33 -9- LSB 1518HV (2) 91 lh/ko 9/ 9
