However, 33 this chapter does not apply to regular route motor carriers 34 of passengers or charter carriers, as defined under 35 -7- LSB 1352YH (2) 91 th/ns 7/ 10 H.F. 7 section 325A.12 , or a transportation network company or a 1 transportation network company driver, as defined in section 2 321N.1 , or delivery network company or a delivery network 3 driver, as defined in section 321Q.1 . 4 Sec. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act takes effect July 1, 5 2026. 6 EXPLANATION 7 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 8 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 9 This bill provides for the regulation of delivery network 10 companies (DNCs) and delivery network drivers (drivers). A 11 DNC is an entity that uses a digital network to connect DNC 12 customers to drivers who provide delivery services. The bill 13 provides that a DNC is not deemed to control, direct, or manage 14 a driver that connects to the DNCâs digital network, or the 15 driverâs personal vehicle, except as agreed to by the DNC and 16 the driver pursuant to a written contract. 17 During the delivery available and service periods, the bill 18 requires financial liability coverage to cover the driver in 19 the amount of at least $50,000 for bodily injury to or death 20 of one person in any one crash or collision, $100,000 for 21 bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in any one 22 crash or collision, and $25,000 for injury to or destruction 23 of property of others in any one crash or collision. The 24 insurance required by the bill may be maintained by the driver, 25 the DNC, or both. 26 Under the bill, if the financial liability coverage 27 maintained by a driver lapses or does not provide coverage in 28 the amounts required by the bill, insurance maintained by a 29 DNC shall provide the coverage beginning with the first dollar 30 of a claim, and the DNC is required to defend the claim. In 31 addition, insurance maintained by a DNC shall not be dependent 32 on the insurer of a driverâs personal vehicle first denying a 33 claim. 34 The financial liability coverage required by the bill must 35 -8- LSB 1352YH (2) 91 th/ns 8/ 10 H.F. 7 be provided by an insurer governed by Code chapter 515, or by a 1 surplus lines insurer governed by Code chapter 515I. 2 The bill requires a driver to carry proof of financial 3 liability coverage at all times during which the driver uses a 4 vehicle in connection with the use of a DNCâs digital network. 5 In the event of a crash or collision, the driver must provide 6 the proof of financial liability coverage, upon request, to any 7 directly interested party or insurer, and to any investigating 8 police officer. 9 The bill requires a DNC to disclose to a driver in writing 10 the types, amounts, terms, and limits of financial liability 11 coverage provided by the DNC to the driver while the driver 12 uses a personal vehicle in connection with the use of the DNCâs 13 digital network, and the fact that the driverâs own financial 14 liability coverage may not provide coverage while the driver is 15 logged on to the DNCâs digital network or is providing delivery 16 services. 17 The bill provides that an insurer may exclude coverage 18 afforded to an insured person under a policy issued to the 19 owner or operator of a personal vehicle for any injury or 20 loss that occurs while the insured is logged on to a DNCâs 21 digital network or while the insured is providing delivery 22 services. An insurer that excludes coverage in this way shall 23 not have a duty to defend or indemnify a claim so excluded from 24 a policy issued by the insurer. An insurer that defends or 25 indemnifies a claim against an insured driver that is excluded 26 under the terms of the driverâs policy has a right of action 27 for contribution or indemnity against an insurer providing 28 financial liability coverage to the driver during the period in 29 which the loss occurred. 30 In addition, the bill provides that in a claims coverage 31 investigation, any involved DNC and any insurer potentially 32 providing coverage must cooperate to facilitate the exchange 33 of relevant information with parties directly involved in the 34 claim. 35 -9- LSB 1352YH (2) 91 th/ns 9/ 10 H.F. 7 The bill exempts drivers from Code chapters 325A (motor 1 carrier authority) and 327D (regulation of carriers). 2 Under current law, a person who violates provisions relating 3 to proof of financial liability coverage (Code section 4 321.20B), including a driver under the bill, is subject to a 5 scheduled fine of $325, or $645 if the person was involved in 6 an accident, among other consequences. There are no penalties 7 set forth in the bill for DNCs that violate the provisions of 8 the bill. 9 Code chapter 321N regulates transportation network companies 10 and restricts certain persons from being eligible to operate 11 as a transportation network company driver. A driver is not 12 subject to the same exclusions while performing delivery 13 services. 14 The bill takes effect July 1, 2026. 15 -10- LSB 1352YH (2) 91 th/ns 10/ 10

EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act takes effect July 1, 5 2026. 6 EXPLANATION 7 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 8 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 9 This bill provides for the regulation of delivery network 10 companies (DNCs) and delivery network drivers (drivers). A 11 DNC is an entity that uses a digital network to connect DNC 12 customers to drivers who provide delivery services. The bill 13 provides that a DNC is not deemed to control, direct, or manage 14 a driver that connects to the DNCâs digital network, or the 15 driverâs personal vehicle, except as agreed to by the DNC and 16 the driver pursuant to a written contract. 17 During the delivery available and service periods, the bill 18 requires financial liability coverage to cover the driver in 19 the amount of at least $50,000 for bodily injury to or death 20 of one person in any one crash or collision, $100,000 for 21 bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in any one 22 crash or collision, and $25,000 for injury to or destruction 23 of property of others in any one crash or collision. The 24 insurance required by the bill may be maintained by the driver, 25 the DNC, or both. 26 Under the bill, if the financial liability coverage 27 maintained by a driver lapses or does not provide coverage in 28 the amounts required by the bill, insurance maintained by a 29 DNC shall provide the coverage beginning with the first dollar 30 of a claim, and the DNC is required to defend the claim. In 31 addition, insurance maintained by a DNC shall not be dependent 32 on the insurer of a driverâs personal vehicle first denying a 33 claim. 34 The financial liability coverage required by the bill must 35 -8- LSB 1352YH (2) 91 th/ns 8/ 10 H.F. 7 be provided by an insurer governed by Code chapter 515, or by a 1 surplus lines insurer governed by Code chapter 515I. 2 The bill requires a driver to carry proof of financial 3 liability coverage at all times during which the driver uses a 4 vehicle in connection with the use of a DNCâs digital network. 5 In the event of a crash or collision, the driver must provide 6 the proof of financial liability coverage, upon request, to any 7 directly interested party or insurer, and to any investigating 8 police officer. 9 The bill requires a DNC to disclose to a driver in writing 10 the types, amounts, terms, and limits of financial liability 11 coverage provided by the DNC to the driver while the driver 12 uses a personal vehicle in connection with the use of the DNCâs 13 digital network, and the fact that the driverâs own financial 14 liability coverage may not provide coverage while the driver is 15 logged on to the DNCâs digital network or is providing delivery 16 services. 17 The bill provides that an insurer may exclude coverage 18 afforded to an insured person under a policy issued to the 19 owner or operator of a personal vehicle for any injury or 20 loss that occurs while the insured is logged on to a DNCâs 21 digital network or while the insured is providing delivery 22 services. An insurer that excludes coverage in this way shall 23 not have a duty to defend or indemnify a claim so excluded from 24 a policy issued by the insurer. An insurer that defends or 25 indemnifies a claim against an insured driver that is excluded 26 under the terms of the driverâs policy has a right of action 27 for contribution or indemnity against an insurer providing 28 financial liability coverage to the driver during the period in 29 which the loss occurred. 30 In addition, the bill provides that in a claims coverage 31 investigation, any involved DNC and any insurer potentially 32 providing coverage must cooperate to facilitate the exchange 33 of relevant information with parties directly involved in the 34 claim. 35 -9- LSB 1352YH (2) 91 th/ns 9/ 10 H.F. 7 The bill exempts drivers from Code chapters 325A (motor 1 carrier authority) and 327D (regulation of carriers). 2 Under current law, a person who violates provisions relating 3 to proof of financial liability coverage (Code section 4 321.20B), including a driver under the bill, is subject to a 5 scheduled fine of $325, or $645 if the person was involved in 6 an accident, among other consequences. There are no penalties 7 set forth in the bill for DNCs that violate the provisions of 8 the bill. 9 Code chapter 321N regulates transportation network companies 10 and restricts certain persons from being eligible to operate 11 as a transportation network company driver. A driver is not 12 subject to the same exclusions while performing delivery 13 services. 14 The bill takes effect July 1, 2026. 15 -10- LSB 1352YH (2) 91 th/ns 10/ 10
