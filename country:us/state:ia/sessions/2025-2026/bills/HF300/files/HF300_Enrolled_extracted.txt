Section 1:
House File 300 - Enrolled House File 300 AN ACT ENACTING THE PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT LICENSURE COMPACT. BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF IOWA: Section 1. NEW SECTION . 147J.1 Physician assistant licensure compact. 1. Purpose. In order to strengthen access to medical services, and in recognition of the advances in the delivery of medical services, the participating states of the physician assistant licensure compact have allied in common purpose to develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing authority of state licensing boards to license and discipline physician assistants and seeks to enhance the portability of a license to practice as a physician assistant while safeguarding the safety of patients. This compact allows medical services to be provided by physician assistants, via the mutual recognition of the licenseeâs qualifying license by other compact participating states. This compact also adopts the prevailing standard for physician assistant licensure and affirms that the practice and delivery of medical services by the physician assistant occurs where the patient is located at the time of the patient encounter, and therefore requires the physician assistant to be under the jurisdiction of the state licensing board where the patient is located. State licensing boards that participate in this compact retain the jurisdiction to impose adverse action against a compact privilege in that state issued to a physician assistant through the procedures House File 300, p. 2 of this compact. The physician assistant licensure compact will alleviate burdens for military families by allowing active duty military personnel and their spouses to obtain a compact privilege based on having an unrestricted license in good standing from a participating state. 2.

The rules of the commission shall have the force of law in each participating state, provided however that where the rules of the commission conflict with the laws of the participating state that establish the medical services a physician assistant may perform in the participating state, as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the commission shall be ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict. d. If a majority of the legislatures of the participating states rejects a commission rule by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt this compact within four years of the date of adoption of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any participating state or to any state applying to participate in the compact. e. Commission rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission. f.

The commission or an authorized committee of the commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted commission rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the internet site of the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule.

(1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each participating state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the compact. (2) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings.

Default, technical assistance, and termination. (1) If the commission determines that a participating state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the commission rules, the commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting state and other participating states. The notice shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the commission may take and shall offer remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default. (2) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from this compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the participating states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact upon such state may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default. (3) Termination of participation in this compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting stateâs legislature, and to the licensing boards of each of the participating states. (4) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.

(6) The defaulting state may appeal its termination from the compact by the commission by petitioning the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices. House File 300, p. 23 The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. (7) Upon the termination of a stateâs participation in the compact, the state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state of such termination. (a) Licensees who have been granted a compact privilege in that state shall retain the compact privilege for one hundred eighty days following the effective date of such termination. (b) Licensees who are licensed in that state who have been granted a compact privilege in a participating state shall retain the compact privilege for one hundred eighty days unless the licensee also has a qualifying license in a participating state or obtains a qualifying license in a participating state before the one-hundred-eighty-day period ends, in which case the compact privilege shall continue. c. Dispute resolution. (1) Upon request by a participating state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to this compact that arise among participating states and between participating and nonparticipating states. (2) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate. d. Enforcement. (1) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this compact and rules of the commission. (2) If compliance is not secured after all means to secure compliance have been exhausted, by majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices, against a participating state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of this compact and the commissionâs promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. House File 300, p. 24 (3) The remedies in subparagraph (2) shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law. e. Legal action against the commission. (1) A participating state may initiate legal action against the commission in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its rules.

In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. (2) No person other than a participating state shall enforce this compact against the commission. 11. Date of implementation of the physician assistant licensure compact commission. a. This compact shall come into effect on the date on which this compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh participating state. (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the states that enacted the compact prior to the commission convening, the charter participating states, to determine if the statute enacted by each such charter participating state is materially different than the model compact. (a) A charter participating state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model compact shall be entitled to the default process set forth in subsection 10, paragraph âbâ . (b) If any participating state later withdraws from the compact or its participation is terminated, the commission shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if the number of participating states should be less than seven. Participating states enacting the compact subsequent to the commission convening shall be subject to the process set forth in subsection 7, paragraph âcâ , subparagraph (21), to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model compact and whether they qualify for House File 300, p. 25 participation in the compact. (2) Participating states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven initial charter participating states shall be subject to the process set forth in subsection 7, paragraph âcâ , subparagraph (21), to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model compact and whether they qualify for participation in the compact. (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically repudiated by the commission. b. Any state that joins this compact shall be subject to the commissionâs rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which this compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day this compact becomes law in that state. c. Any participating state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same. (1) A participating stateâs withdrawal shall not take effect until one hundred eighty days after enactment of the repealing statute. During this one-hundred-eighty-day period, all compact privileges that were in effect in the withdrawing state and were granted to licensees licensed in the withdrawing state shall remain in effect. If any licensee licensed in the withdrawing state is also licensed in another participating state or obtains a license in another participating state within the one hundred eighty days, the licenseeâs compact privileges in other participating states shall not be affected by the passage of the one hundred eighty days. (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the state licensing board of the withdrawing state to comply with the investigative, and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal. (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing a state from this compact, the state shall immediately provide notice House File 300, p. 26 of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of one hundred eighty days after the date of such notice of withdrawal. d. Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any physician assistant licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between participating states and between a participating state and nonparticipating state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact. e. This compact may be amended by the participating states. No amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any participating state until it is enacted materially in the same manner into the laws of all participating states as determined by the commission. 12. Construction and severability. a. This compact and the commissionâs rulemaking authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit the commissionâs rulemaking authority solely for those purposes. b. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. c. Notwithstanding paragraph âbâ or this subsection 12, the commission may deny a stateâs participation in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of subsection 10, paragraph âbâ , terminate a participating stateâs participation in the compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a participating state is, or would be with respect to a state seeking to participate in the compact, a material departure House File 300, p. 27 from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining participating states and in full force and effect as to the participating state affected as to all severable matters. 13. Binding effect of compact. a. Nothing in this compact prevents the enforcement of any other law of a participating state that is not inconsistent with this compact. b. Any laws in a participating state in conflict with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict. c. All agreements between the commission and the participating states are binding in accordance with their terms. ______________________________ PAT GRASSLEY Speaker of the House ______________________________ AMY SINCLAIR President of the Senate I hereby certify that this bill originated in the House and is known as House File 300, Ninety-first General Assembly. ______________________________ MEGHAN NELSON Chief Clerk of the House Approved _______________, 2025 ______________________________ KIM REYNOLDS Governor

House File 300 - Enrolled House File 300 AN ACT ENACTING THE PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT LICENSURE COMPACT. BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF IOWA: Section 1. NEW SECTION . 147J.1 Physician assistant licensure compact. 1. Purpose. In order to strengthen access to medical services, and in recognition of the advances in the delivery of medical services, the participating states of the physician assistant licensure compact have allied in common purpose to develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing authority of state licensing boards to license and discipline physician assistants and seeks to enhance the portability of a license to practice as a physician assistant while safeguarding the safety of patients. This compact allows medical services to be provided by physician assistants, via the mutual recognition of the licenseeâs qualifying license by other compact participating states. This compact also adopts the prevailing standard for physician assistant licensure and affirms that the practice and delivery of medical services by the physician assistant occurs where the patient is located at the time of the patient encounter, and therefore requires the physician assistant to be under the jurisdiction of the state licensing board where the patient is located. State licensing boards that participate in this compact retain the jurisdiction to impose adverse action against a compact privilege in that state issued to a physician assistant through the procedures House File 300, p. 2 of this compact. The physician assistant licensure compact will alleviate burdens for military families by allowing active duty military personnel and their spouses to obtain a compact privilege based on having an unrestricted license in good standing from a participating state. 2. Definitions. In this compact: a. âAdverse actionâ means any administrative, civil, equitable, or criminal action permitted by a stateâs laws which is imposed by a licensing board or other authority against a physician assistant license or license application or compact privilege such as license denial, censure, revocation, suspension, probation, monitoring of the licensee, or restriction on the licenseeâs practice. b. âCompact privilegeâ means the authorization granted by a remote state to allow a licensee from another participating state to practice as a physician assistant to provide medical services and other licensed activity to a patient located in the remote state under the remote stateâs laws and regulations. c. âConvictionâ means a finding by a court that an individual is guilty of a felony or misdemeanor offense through adjudication or entry of a plea of guilt or no contest to the charge by the offender. d. âCriminal background checkâ means the submission of fingerprints or other biometric-based information for a license applicant for the purpose of obtaining that applicantâs criminal history record information, as defined in 28 C.F.R.

(b) If the licensee terminates the qualifying license through which the licensee applied for the compact privilege before its scheduled expiration, and the licensee has a qualifying license in another participating state, the licensee shall inform the commission that it is changing to that participating state the participating state through which it applies for a compact privilege and pay to the commission any compact privilege fee required by commission rule. (4) The commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the commission pledge the credit of any of the participating states, except by and with the authority of the participating state.

The procurement of insurance of any type by the commission shall not in any way compromise or limit the immunity granted hereunder. (2) The commission shall defend any member, officer, executive director, employee, and representative of the commission in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or as determined by the commission that the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to prohibit that person from retaining counsel at the personâs own expense; and provided further, that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from that personâs intentional or willful or wanton misconduct.

(5) Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on the liability of any licensee for professional malpractice or misconduct, which shall be governed solely by any other applicable state laws. (6) Nothing herein shall be construed to designate the venue or jurisdiction to bring actions for alleged acts of malpractice, professional misconduct, negligence, or other such civil action pertaining to the practice of a physician assistant. All such matters shall be determined exclusively by state law other than this compact. (7) Nothing in this compact shall be interpreted to waive or otherwise abrogate a participating stateâs state action immunity or state action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims under the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, or any other state or federal antitrust or anticompetitive law or regulation. (8) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to be a waiver of sovereign immunity by the participating states or by the commission. 8. Data system. a. The commission shall provide for the development, maintenance, operation, and utilization of a coordinated data and reporting system containing licensure, adverse action, and House File 300, p. 17 the reporting of the existence of significant investigative information on all licensed physician assistants and applicants denied a license in participating states. b. Notwithstanding any other state law to the contrary, a participating state shall submit a uniform data set to the data system on all physician assistants to whom this compact is applicable, utilizing a unique identifier, as required by the rules of the commission, including: (1) Identifying information. (2) Licensure data. (3) Adverse actions against a license or compact privilege. (4) Any denial of application for licensure, and the reason for such denial, excluding the reporting of any criminal history record information where prohibited by law. (5) The existence of significant investigative information. (6) Other information that may facilitate the administration of this compact, as determined by the rules of the commission. c. Significant investigative information pertaining to a licensee in any participating state shall only be available to other participating states. d. The commission shall promptly notify all participating states of any adverse action taken against a licensee or an individual applying for a license that has been reported to it. This adverse action information shall be available to any other participating state. e. Participating states contributing information to the data system may, in accordance with state or federal law, designate information that may not be shared with the public without the express permission of the contributing state. Notwithstanding any such designation, such information shall be reported to the commission through the data system. f. Any information submitted to the data system that is subsequently expunged pursuant to federal law or the laws of the participating state contributing the information shall be removed from the data system upon reporting of such by the participating state to the commission. g. The records and information provided to a participating state pursuant to this compact or through the data system, House File 300, p. 18 when certified by the commission or an agent thereof, shall constitute the authenticated business records of the commission, and shall be entitled to any associated hearsay exception in any relevant judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative proceedings in a participating state. 9. Rulemaking. a. The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this subsection and the rules adopted thereunder. Commission rules shall become binding as of the date specified by the commission for each rule. b. The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer this compact and achieve its purposes. A commission rule shall be invalid and not have force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because the commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this compact, or the powers granted in this subsection, or based upon another applicable standard of review. c. The rules of the commission shall have the force of law in each participating state, provided however that where the rules of the commission conflict with the laws of the participating state that establish the medical services a physician assistant may perform in the participating state, as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the commission shall be ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict. d. If a majority of the legislatures of the participating states rejects a commission rule by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt this compact within four years of the date of adoption of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any participating state or to any state applying to participate in the compact. e. Commission rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission. f. Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the commission, and at least thirty days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered and voted House File 300, p. 19 upon, the commission shall file a notice of proposed rulemaking using all of the following methods: (1) On the internet site of the commission or other publicly accessible platform. (2) To persons who have requested notice of the commissionâs notices of proposed rulemaking. (3) In such other ways as the commission may by rule specify. g. The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include all of the following: (1) The time, date, and location of the public hearing on the proposed rule and the proposed time, date, and location of the meeting in which the proposed rule will be considered and voted upon. (2) The text of the proposed rule and the reason for the proposed rule. (3) A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person and the date by which written comments must be received.

If the hearing is to be held via electronic means, the commission shall publish the mechanism for access to the electronic hearing. (1) All persons wishing to be heard at the hearing shall as directed in the notice of proposed rulemaking, not less than five business days before the scheduled date of the hearing, notify the commission of their desire to appear and testify at the hearing. (2) Hearings shall be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing. (3) All hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the recording and the written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments received in response to the proposed rulemaking shall be made House File 300, p. 20 available to a person upon request. (4) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each proposed rule. Proposed rules may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this section. j. Following the public hearing the commission shall consider all written and oral comments timely received. k. The commission shall, by majority vote of all delegates, take final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if adopted, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule. (1) If adopted, the rule shall be posted on the commissionâs internet site. (2) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule. (3) The commission shall provide on its internet site an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters. (4) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in paragraph âlâ , the effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than thirty days after the commission issued the notice that it adopted the rule. l. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule with twenty-four hours prior notice, without the opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in this compact and in this subsection shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this paragraph, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately by the commission in order to do any of the following: (1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare. (2) Prevent a loss of commission or participating state House File 300, p. 21 funds. (3) Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a commission rule that is established by federal law or rule. (4) Protect public health and safety. m. The commission or an authorized committee of the commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted commission rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the internet site of the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made as set forth in the notice of revisions and delivered to the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission. n. No participating stateâs rulemaking requirements shall apply under this compact. 10. Oversight, dispute resolution, and enforcement. a. Oversight. (1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each participating state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the compact. (2) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter. (3) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact or the commissionâs rules and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all House File 300, p. 22 purposes. Failure to provide the commission with service of process shall render a judgment or order in such proceeding void as to the commission, this compact, or commission rules. b. Default, technical assistance, and termination. (1) If the commission determines that a participating state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the commission rules, the commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting state and other participating states. The notice shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the commission may take and shall offer remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default. (2) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from this compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the participating states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact upon such state may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default. (3) Termination of participation in this compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting stateâs legislature, and to the licensing boards of each of the participating states. (4) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination. (5) The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from this compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state. (6) The defaulting state may appeal its termination from the compact by the commission by petitioning the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices. House File 300, p. 23 The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. (7) Upon the termination of a stateâs participation in the compact, the state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state of such termination. (a) Licensees who have been granted a compact privilege in that state shall retain the compact privilege for one hundred eighty days following the effective date of such termination. (b) Licensees who are licensed in that state who have been granted a compact privilege in a participating state shall retain the compact privilege for one hundred eighty days unless the licensee also has a qualifying license in a participating state or obtains a qualifying license in a participating state before the one-hundred-eighty-day period ends, in which case the compact privilege shall continue. c. Dispute resolution. (1) Upon request by a participating state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to this compact that arise among participating states and between participating and nonparticipating states. (2) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate. d. Enforcement. (1) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this compact and rules of the commission. (2) If compliance is not secured after all means to secure compliance have been exhausted, by majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices, against a participating state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of this compact and the commissionâs promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. House File 300, p. 24 (3) The remedies in subparagraph (2) shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law. e. Legal action against the commission. (1) A participating state may initiate legal action against the commission in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. (2) No person other than a participating state shall enforce this compact against the commission. 11. Date of implementation of the physician assistant licensure compact commission. a. This compact shall come into effect on the date on which this compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh participating state. (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the states that enacted the compact prior to the commission convening, the charter participating states, to determine if the statute enacted by each such charter participating state is materially different than the model compact. (a) A charter participating state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model compact shall be entitled to the default process set forth in subsection 10, paragraph âbâ . (b) If any participating state later withdraws from the compact or its participation is terminated, the commission shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if the number of participating states should be less than seven. Participating states enacting the compact subsequent to the commission convening shall be subject to the process set forth in subsection 7, paragraph âcâ , subparagraph (21), to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model compact and whether they qualify for House File 300, p. 25 participation in the compact. (2) Participating states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven initial charter participating states shall be subject to the process set forth in subsection 7, paragraph âcâ , subparagraph (21), to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model compact and whether they qualify for participation in the compact. (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically repudiated by the commission. b. Any state that joins this compact shall be subject to the commissionâs rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which this compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day this compact becomes law in that state. c. Any participating state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same. (1) A participating stateâs withdrawal shall not take effect until one hundred eighty days after enactment of the repealing statute. During this one-hundred-eighty-day period, all compact privileges that were in effect in the withdrawing state and were granted to licensees licensed in the withdrawing state shall remain in effect. If any licensee licensed in the withdrawing state is also licensed in another participating state or obtains a license in another participating state within the one hundred eighty days, the licenseeâs compact privileges in other participating states shall not be affected by the passage of the one hundred eighty days. (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the state licensing board of the withdrawing state to comply with the investigative, and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal. (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing a state from this compact, the state shall immediately provide notice House File 300, p. 26 of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of one hundred eighty days after the date of such notice of withdrawal. d. Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any physician assistant licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between participating states and between a participating state and nonparticipating state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact. e. This compact may be amended by the participating states. No amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any participating state until it is enacted materially in the same manner into the laws of all participating states as determined by the commission. 12. Construction and severability. a. This compact and the commissionâs rulemaking authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit the commissionâs rulemaking authority solely for those purposes. b. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. c. Notwithstanding paragraph âbâ or this subsection 12, the commission may deny a stateâs participation in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of subsection 10, paragraph âbâ , terminate a participating stateâs participation in the compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a participating state is, or would be with respect to a state seeking to participate in the compact, a material departure House File 300, p. 27 from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining participating states and in full force and effect as to the participating state affected as to all severable matters. 13. Binding effect of compact. a. Nothing in this compact prevents the enforcement of any other law of a participating state that is not inconsistent with this compact. b. Any laws in a participating state in conflict with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict. c. All agreements between the commission and the participating states are binding in accordance with their terms. ______________________________ PAT GRASSLEY Speaker of the House ______________________________ AMY SINCLAIR President of the Senate I hereby certify that this bill originated in the House and is known as House File 300, Ninety-first General Assembly. ______________________________ MEGHAN NELSON Chief Clerk of the House Approved _______________, 2025 ______________________________ KIM REYNOLDS Governor
