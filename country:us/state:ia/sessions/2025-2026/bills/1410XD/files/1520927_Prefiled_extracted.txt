10 EXPLANATION
11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
12 the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
13 This bill relates to matters under the purview of the
14 economic development authority and the Iowa finance authority
15 including the strategic infrastructure program, brownfield,
16 grayfield, and redevelopment tax credits, community attraction
17 and tourism, vision Iowa, sports tourism marketing, the
18 historic preservation tax credit, homelessness, the title
19 guaranty board, and arts and culture.
20 Division I eliminates the requirement that the Iowa
21 innovation council review and make recommendations on all
22 applications received by the Iowa economic development
23 authority (IEDA) for financial assistance under the Iowa
24 strategic infrastructure program, and instead requires a
25 committee appointed by the IEDA director to conduct a review
26 and make recommendations.
27 Division II repeals the brownfield redevelopment program,
28 fund, and advisory council (council).
29 The bill requires that the amount of a redevelopment tax
30 credit be determined by members of the IEDA appointed by the
31 governor (the board), rather than determined by the board
32 in conjunction with the council as required under current
33 law. The IEDA shall accept and review applications for the
34 redevelopment tax credit and make award recommendations to
35 the board, rather than accept and review applications in
LSB 1410XD (12) 91
-16- nls/ko 16/21
S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 conjunction with the council as required under current law.
2 IEDA may engage outside experts to complete a technical,
3 financial, or other review. The bill makes conforming changes
4 related to elimination of the council.
5 Under current law, upon completion of a registered project
6 for redevelopment tax credits, an audit of the project
7 completed by an independent certified public accountant (CPA)
8 shall be submitted to the IEDA. Under the bill, the investor
9 shall engage a CPA to conduct an examination of the project
10 and submit the examination, and a statement of the amount of
11 final qualifying investments, to the IEDA. Upon review of the
12 examination and statement, the IEDA may issue a tax credit
13 certificate to the investor.
14 On the effective date of the bill, all unencumbered and
15 unobligated moneys remaining in the brownfield redevelopment
16 fund are transferred to a fund or funds established pursuant to
17 Code section 15.335B, as determined by the IEDA.
18 Division III eliminates the requirement that an applicant
19 awarded financial assistance under both the vision Iowa program
20 and the community attraction and tourism program provide and
21 pay at least 50 percent of the cost of a standard medical
22 insurance plan for all full-time employees after the completion
23 of the project for which financial assistance was received.
24 This division applies to applicants awarded financial
25 assistance under both programs on or after the effective date
26 of the bill, and applies retroactively to applicants awarded
27 financial assistance under both programs prior to the effective
28 date of the bill.
29 Under division IV, the director of the IEDA shall appoint a
30 review committee composed of members with relevant expertise to
31 review community attraction and tourism program applications
32 and sports tourism marketing and infrastructure program
33 applications. Under current law, the review committee is
34 composed of five members of the IEDA board.
35 Division V requires, in addition to existing requirements
LSB 1410XD (12) 91
-17- nls/ko 17/21
S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 for the historic preservation tax credit program (historic
2 tax program) under current law, for a project for the
3 rehabilitation of property to be considered a “qualified
4 rehabilitation project” (project), that the property not be a
5 single-family dwelling unit, unless the project will result
6 in two or more new single-family dwelling units that were
7 not available for occupancy for at least six months prior to
8 the project, and the dwelling units are located in the same
9 neighborhood as confirmed by the IEDA. The single-family
10 dwelling units must be made available for occupancy as a result
11 of the project. The IEDA may promulgate rules that specify the
12 criteria used to determine if a property is a single-family
13 dwelling unit, and to determine if a property is a qualified
14 rehabilitation project.
15 Under current law, upon successful registration of a
16 project under the historic tax program, the eligible taxpayer
17 (taxpayer) shall enter into an agreement with the IEDA that
18 contains mutually agreeable terms and conditions including the
19 commencement date of the project, which shall not be later than
20 the end of the fiscal year in which the agreement is entered
21 into, and the completion date of the project, which shall be
22 within 36 months of the commencement date. Under the bill,
23 the date by which the project must commence shall be no later
24 than one calendar year from the registration date, except
25 that upon application of the taxpayer the IEDA may extend the
26 date of commencement up to 12 additional months. The date by
27 which the project must be completed shall be no later than
28 three consecutive calendar years from the registration date,
29 except that upon application of the taxpayer, the IEDA may
30 extend the date of commencement up to another 12 months. The
31 project is complete as of the date the property is placed in
32 service. Upon application of the taxpayer made prior to the
33 expiration of the 12-month extension, the IEDA may extend the
34 date by which the project must be completed up to an additional
35 12 months. The taxpayer must substantiate that the requested
LSB 1410XD (12) 91
-18- nls/ko 18/21
S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 extension is warranted due to extenuating circumstances.
2 Under the bill, the IEDA may grant historic preservation
3 tax credits beyond the aggregate tax credit award limit in one
4 fiscal year if, during that fiscal year, the IEDA receives an
5 application for a project that has qualified rehabilitation
6 expenditures that, if registered, would make the taxpayer
7 eligible for tax credits of $10 million or more. The IEDA is
8 then permitted to award tax credits during that fiscal year not
9 to exceed 20 percent more than the maximum aggregate tax credit
10 award limit. Such tax credits awarded shall be considered for
11 purposes of calculating the maximum aggregate tax credit award
12 limit in the immediately succeeding fiscal year.
13 Under division VI, the Iowa finance authority (IFA)
14 may adopt rules to carry out the duties of IFA related to
15 homelessness, and may establish internal rules of procedure,
16 consistent with the requirements of the federal McKinney-Vento
17 Homeless Assistance Act. Under current law, IFA must adopt
18 rules.
19 Division VII eliminates the title guaranty division board.
20 The powers of the title guaranty division relating to the
21 issuance of title guaranties are vested in the IFA board of
22 directors. The director of the IFA shall appoint an attorney
23 as director of the division, and the division director’s
24 appointment and compensation shall be exempt from the merit
25 system. The bill makes conforming changes to Code sections
26 16.1A, 16.91, 16.92, and 16.93.
27 Division VIII is related to arts and culture. Under current
28 law, the IEDA is responsible for the Iowa cultural trust,
29 including the issuance of trust fund credits for the promotion
30 of the arts, history, or the sciences and humanities; the
31 issuance of grants for qualified organizations; developing and
32 implementing fee-based educational programming opportunities;
33 conducting surveys of existing art and cultural programs
34 and activities within the state; and the establishment and
35 administration of a film office. The bill maintains the

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 responsibility for the IEDA to accept, receive, and administer
2 grants or other funds or gifts from public or private agencies;
3 to design and carry out a comprehensive, statewide, long-range
4 plan (plan) with the assistance of the Iowa arts council to
5 develop the arts in Iowa; and to establish advisory groups for
6 the receipt of federal funds or grants or the administration
7 of the IEDA’s programs. Under the bill, the IEDA is no longer
8 required to establish and administer a film office. Instead,
9 the IEDA is responsible for providing technical assistance for
10 the production of film, television, and video projects in the
11 state.
12 The bill eliminates certified cultural and entertainment
13 districts. The bill eliminates the cultural grant programs
14 under current law, which requires the IEDA to establish
15 a grant program for cities and nonprofit, tax-exempt
16 community organizations for the development of community
17 programs that provide local jobs for Iowa residents and
18 promote Iowa’s historic, ethnic, and cultural heritages
19 through the development of festivals, music, drama, cultural
20 programs, or tourist attractions. Additionally, the IEDA
21 is required to establish a grant program which provides
22 general operating budget support to major, multidisciplinary
23 cultural organizations that demonstrate cultural and managerial
24 excellence on a continuing basis to the citizens of Iowa.
25 Instead, the bill creates the arts and culture enhancement
26 fund (enhancement fund), under which the IEDA shall allocate
27 moneys to the fund to provide support to municipal and
28 nonprofit arts and cultural organizations that serve as
29 significant attractions or community resources; to support
30 artists and entities that foster artistic and cultural
31 expression, promote lifelong learning and engagement in the
32 arts, advance community development goals, or emphasize Iowa’s
33 diverse heritage through artwork; to increase access to arts
34 and culture in rural and underserved communities; for the
35 promotion of and investment in film, television, and video
LSB 1410XD (12) 91
-20- nls/ko 20/21
S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 projects produced in the state; and to address other goals and
2 priorities in the plan designed by the IEDA. The enhancement
3 fund consists of moneys appropriated by the general assembly
4 and any other moneys that are lawfully available to the IEDA.
5 Each fiscal year, $520,000 is appropriated from gambling
6 and sports wagering taxes to the IEDA for deposit in the
7 enhancement fund. The IEDA may establish and adopt by rule
8 eligibility and priority criteria for allocation of moneys in
9 the enhancement fund.
10 The Iowa arts council (arts council) may elect a chairperson
11 and vice chairperson from the members of the arts council,
12 rather than being designated by the governor under current law.
13 In addition to duties under current law, the arts council is
14 required to recommend programs to ensure that Iowa citizens and
15 communities have access to the cultural, civic, economic, and
16 educational benefits of the arts.
17 The bill repeals Code sections 15.437 through 15.441, 15.476
18 through 15.479, 15.481, and 15.482, eliminating the Iowa
19 cultural trust Act, including the Iowa cultural trust, trust
20 fund, grant account, and board of trustees, and eliminates the
21 arts and cultural conferences and caucuses, the cultural and
22 entertainment districts, the Iowa great places program and
23 fund, and the culture, history, and arts teams program.
24 On the effective date of this division of the bill, all
25 unencumbered and unobligated moneys remaining in the Iowa
26 great places program fund, Iowa cultural trust fund, and Iowa
27 cultural trust grant account are transferred to the arts and
28 culture enhancement fund established in the bill.
29 Division IX makes conforming changes to Code sections 16.6
30 and 16.64.

20 Division I eliminates the requirement that the Iowa
21 innovation council review and make recommendations on all
22 applications received by the Iowa economic development

6 in two or more new single-family dwelling units that were
7 not available for occupancy for at least six months prior to
8 the project, and the dwelling units are located in the same
9 neighborhood as confirmed by the IEDA. The single-family
10 dwelling units must be made available for occupancy as a result
11 of the project. The IEDA may promulgate rules that specify the
12 criteria used to determine if a property is a single-family
13 dwelling unit, and to determine if a property is a qualified
14 rehabilitation project.
15 Under current law, upon successful registration of a
16 project under the historic tax program, the eligible taxpayer
17 (taxpayer) shall enter into an agreement with the IEDA that
18 contains mutually agreeable terms and conditions including the
19 commencement date of the project, which shall not be later than
20 the end of the fiscal year in which the agreement is entered

28 three consecutive calendar years from the registration date,
29 except that upon application of the taxpayer, the IEDA may
30 extend the date of commencement up to another 12 months. The

4 fiscal year if, during that fiscal year, the IEDA receives an
5 application for a project that has qualified rehabilitation
6 expenditures that, if registered, would make the taxpayer
7 eligible for tax credits of $10 million or more. The IEDA is
8 then permitted to award tax credits during that fiscal year not
9 to exceed 20 percent more than the maximum aggregate tax credit
10 award limit. Such tax credits awarded shall be considered for
11 purposes of calculating the maximum aggregate tax credit award
12 limit in the immediately succeeding fiscal year.

14 may adopt rules to carry out the duties of IFA related to
15 homelessness, and may establish internal rules of procedure,

18 rules.
19 Division VII eliminates the title guaranty division board.
20 The powers of the title guaranty division relating to the
21 issuance of title guaranties are vested in the IFA board of
22 directors. The director of the IFA shall appoint an attorney
23 as director of the division, and the division director’s
24 appointment and compensation shall be exempt from the merit
25 system. The bill makes conforming changes to Code sections

27 Division VIII is related to arts and culture. Under current
28 law, the IEDA is responsible for the Iowa cultural trust,
29 including the issuance of trust fund credits for the promotion
30 of the arts, history, or the sciences and humanities; the
31 issuance of grants for qualified organizations; developing and
32 implementing fee-based educational programming opportunities;

5 develop the arts in Iowa; and to establish advisory groups for
6 the receipt of federal funds or grants or the administration

8 required to establish and administer a film office. Instead,
9 the IEDA is responsible for providing technical assistance for
10 the production of film, television, and video projects in the
11 state.
12 The bill eliminates certified cultural and entertainment
13 districts. The bill eliminates the cultural grant programs
14 under current law, which requires the IEDA to establish
15 a grant program for cities and nonprofit, tax-exempt
16 community organizations for the development of community
17 programs that provide local jobs for Iowa residents and
18 promote Iowa’s historic, ethnic, and cultural heritages
19 through the development of festivals, music, drama, cultural

21 is required to establish a grant program which provides
22 general operating budget support to major, multidisciplinary
23 cultural organizations that demonstrate cultural and managerial
24 excellence on a continuing basis to the citizens of Iowa.
25 Instead, the bill creates the arts and culture enhancement

29 significant attractions or community resources; to support

31 expression, promote lifelong learning and engagement in the

1 projects produced in the state; and to address other goals and
2 priorities in the plan designed by the IEDA. The enhancement
3 fund consists of moneys appropriated by the general assembly
4 and any other moneys that are lawfully available to the IEDA.
5 Each fiscal year, $520,000 is appropriated from gambling
6 and sports wagering taxes to the IEDA for deposit in the
7 enhancement fund. The IEDA may establish and adopt by rule
8 eligibility and priority criteria for allocation of moneys in
9 the enhancement fund.
10 The Iowa arts council (arts council) may elect a chairperson
11 and vice chairperson from the members of the arts council,
12 rather than being designated by the governor under current law.
13 In addition to duties under current law, the arts council is
14 required to recommend programs to ensure that Iowa citizens and
15 communities have access to the cultural, civic, economic, and
16 educational benefits of the arts.
17 The bill repeals Code sections 15.437 through 15.441, 15.476
18 through 15.479, 15.481, and 15.482, eliminating the Iowa
19 cultural trust Act, including the Iowa cultural trust, trust
20 fund, grant account, and board of trustees, and eliminates the
21 arts and cultural conferences and caucuses, the cultural and
22 entertainment districts, the Iowa great places program and
23 fund, and the culture, history, and arts teams program.
24 On the effective date of this division of the bill, all
25 unencumbered and unobligated moneys remaining in the Iowa
26 great places program fund, Iowa cultural trust fund, and Iowa
27 cultural trust grant account are transferred to the arts and
28 culture enhancement fund established in the bill.
29 Division IX makes conforming changes to Code sections 16.6
30 and 16.64.
