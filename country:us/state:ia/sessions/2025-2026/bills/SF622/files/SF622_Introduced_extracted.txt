For districts approved before July 1, 2018, the area 21 consists of contiguous parcels and does not exceed twenty-five 22 acres in total. For districts approved on or after July 1, 23 2020, the area consists of contiguous parcels and does not 24 exceed seventy-five one hundred twenty-five acres in total. 25 Sec. 45. RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY. This division of this 26 Act applies retroactively to July 1, 2020. 27 EXPLANATION 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 29 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 30 This bill relates to matters under the purview of the 31 economic development authority and the Iowa finance authority 32 including the strategic infrastructure program, brownfield, 33 grayfield, and redevelopment tax credits, community attraction 34 and tourism, vision Iowa, sports tourism marketing, the 35 -17- LSB 1410SZ (2) 91 nls/ko 17/ 23 S.F. 622 historic preservation tax credit, homelessness, the title 1 guaranty board, arts and culture, and the Iowa reinvestment 2 Act. 3 Division I eliminates the requirement that the Iowa 4 innovation council review and make recommendations on all 5 applications received by the Iowa economic development 6 authority (IEDA) for financial assistance under the Iowa 7 strategic infrastructure program, and instead requires a 8 committee appointed by the IEDA director to conduct a review 9 and make recommendations. 10 Division II repeals the brownfield redevelopment program, 11 fund, and advisory council (council). 12 The bill requires that the amount of a redevelopment tax 13 credit be determined by members of the IEDA appointed by the 14 governor (the board), rather than determined by the board 15 in conjunction with the council as required under current 16 law. The IEDA shall accept and review applications for the 17 redevelopment tax credit and make award recommendations to 18 the board, rather than accept and review applications in 19 conjunction with the council as required under current law. 20 IEDA may engage outside experts to complete a technical, 21 financial, or other review. The bill makes conforming changes 22 related to elimination of the council. 23 Under current law, upon completion of a registered project 24 for redevelopment tax credits, an audit of the project 25 completed by an independent certified public accountant (CPA) 26 shall be submitted to the IEDA. Under the bill, the investor 27 shall engage a CPA to conduct an examination of the project 28 and submit the examination, and a statement of the amount of 29 final qualifying investments, to the IEDA. Upon review of the 30 examination and statement, the IEDA may issue a tax credit 31 certificate to the investor. 32 On the effective date of the bill, all unencumbered and 33 unobligated moneys remaining in the brownfield redevelopment 34 fund are transferred to a fund or funds established pursuant to 35 -18- LSB 1410SZ (2) 91 nls/ko 18/ 23 S.F. 622 Code section 15.335B, as determined by the IEDA. 1 Division III eliminates the requirement that an applicant 2 awarded financial assistance under both the vision Iowa program 3 and the community attraction and tourism program provide and 4 pay at least 50 percent of the cost of a standard medical 5 insurance plan for all full-time employees after the completion 6 of the project for which financial assistance was received. 7 This division applies to applicants awarded financial 8 assistance under both programs on or after the effective date 9 of the bill, and applies retroactively to applicants awarded 10 financial assistance under both programs prior to the effective 11 date of the bill. 12 Under division IV, the director of the IEDA shall appoint a 13 review committee composed of members with relevant expertise to 14 review community attraction and tourism program applications 15 and sports tourism marketing and infrastructure program 16 applications. Under current law, the review committee is 17 composed of five members of the IEDA board. 18 Division V requires, in addition to existing requirements 19 for the historic preservation tax credit program (historic 20 tax program) under current law, for a project for the 21 rehabilitation of property to be considered a âqualified 22 rehabilitation projectâ (project), that the property not be a 23 single-family dwelling unit, unless the project will result 24 in two or more new single-family dwelling units that were 25 not available for occupancy for at least six months prior to 26 the project, and the dwelling units are located in the same 27 neighborhood as confirmed by the IEDA. The single-family 28 dwelling units must be made available for occupancy as a result 29 of the project. The IEDA may promulgate rules that specify the 30 criteria used to determine if a property is a single-family 31 dwelling unit, and to determine if a property is a qualified 32 rehabilitation project. 33 Currently, the refundability of a historic preservation tax 34 credit in excess of tax liability is gradually reduced until 35 -19- LSB 1410SZ (2) 91 nls/ko 19/ 23 S.F. 622 the tax credit is 75 percent refundable for tax years beginning 1 on or after January 1, 2027. The bill strikes the gradual 2 reduction of the tax credit refundability and makes the tax 3 credit 100 percent refundable for tax years beginning on or 4 after January 1, 2026. The historic preservation tax credit 5 certificate is also currently transferable to another taxpayer. 6 The bill prohibits such a transfer to another taxpayer on or 7 after January 1, 2026. 8 Under current law, upon successful registration of a 9 project under the historic tax program, the eligible taxpayer 10 (taxpayer) shall enter into an agreement with the IEDA that 11 contains mutually agreeable terms and conditions including the 12 commencement date of the project, which shall not be later than 13 the end of the fiscal year in which the agreement is entered 14 into, and the completion date of the project, which shall be 15 within 36 months of the commencement date. Under the bill, 16 the date by which the project must commence shall be no later 17 than one calendar year from the registration date, except 18 that upon application of the taxpayer the IEDA may extend the 19 date of commencement up to 12 additional months. The date by 20 which the project must be completed shall be no later than 21 three consecutive calendar years from the registration date, 22 except that upon application of the taxpayer, the IEDA may 23 extend the date of commencement up to another 12 months. The 24 project is complete as of the date the property is placed in 25 service. Upon application of the taxpayer made prior to the 26 expiration of the 12-month extension, the IEDA may extend the 27 date by which the project must be completed up to an additional 28 12 months. The taxpayer must substantiate that the requested 29 extension is warranted due to extenuating circumstances. 30 Under the bill, the IEDA may grant historic preservation 31 tax credits beyond the aggregate tax credit award limit in one 32 fiscal year if, during that fiscal year, the IEDA receives an 33 application for a project that has qualified rehabilitation 34 expenditures that, if registered, would make the taxpayer 35 -20- LSB 1410SZ (2) 91 nls/ko 20/ 23 S.F. 622 eligible for tax credits of $10 million or more. The IEDA is 1 then permitted to award tax credits during that fiscal year not 2 to exceed 20 percent more than the maximum aggregate tax credit 3 award limit. Such tax credits awarded shall be considered for 4 purposes of calculating the maximum aggregate tax credit award 5 limit in the immediately succeeding fiscal year. 6 Under division VI, the Iowa finance authority (IFA) 7 may adopt rules to carry out the duties of IFA related to 8 homelessness, and may establish internal rules of procedure, 9 consistent with the requirements of the federal McKinney-Vento 10 Homeless Assistance Act. Under current law, IFA must adopt 11 rules. 12 Division VII eliminates the title guaranty division board. 13 The powers of the title guaranty division relating to the 14 issuance of title guaranties are vested in the IFA board of 15 directors. The director of the IFA shall appoint an attorney 16 as director of the division, and the division directorâs 17 appointment and compensation shall be exempt from the merit 18 system. The bill makes conforming changes to Code sections 19 16.1A, 16.91, 16.92, and 16.93. 20 Division VIII is related to arts and culture. Under current 21 law, the IEDA is responsible for the Iowa cultural trust, 22 including the issuance of trust fund credits for the promotion 23 of the arts, history, or the sciences and humanities; the 24 issuance of grants for qualified organizations; developing and 25 implementing fee-based educational programming opportunities; 26 conducting surveys of existing art and cultural programs 27 and activities within the state; and the establishment and 28 administration of a film office. The bill maintains the 29 responsibility for the IEDA to accept, receive, and administer 30 grants or other funds or gifts from public or private agencies; 31 to design and carry out a comprehensive, statewide, long-range 32 plan (plan) with the assistance of the Iowa arts council to 33 develop the arts in Iowa; and to establish advisory groups for 34 the receipt of federal funds or grants or the administration 35 -21- LSB 1410SZ (2) 91 nls/ko 21/ 23 S.F. 622 of the IEDAâs programs. Under the bill, the IEDA is no longer 1 required to establish and administer a film office. Instead, 2 the IEDA is responsible for providing technical assistance for 3 the production of film, television, and video projects in the 4 state. 5 The bill eliminates certified cultural and entertainment 6 districts. The bill eliminates the cultural grant programs 7 under current law, which requires the IEDA to establish 8 a grant program for cities and nonprofit, tax-exempt 9 community organizations for the development of community 10 programs that provide local jobs for Iowa residents and 11 promote Iowaâs historic, ethnic, and cultural heritages 12 through the development of festivals, music, drama, cultural 13 programs, or tourist attractions. Additionally, the IEDA 14 is required to establish a grant program which provides 15 general operating budget support to major, multidisciplinary 16 cultural organizations that demonstrate cultural and managerial 17 excellence on a continuing basis to the citizens of Iowa. 18 Instead, the bill creates the arts and culture enhancement 19 fund (enhancement fund), under which the IEDA shall allocate 20 moneys to the fund to provide support to municipal and 21 nonprofit arts and cultural organizations that serve as 22 significant attractions or community resources; to support 23 artists and entities that foster artistic and cultural 24 expression, promote lifelong learning and engagement in the 25 arts, advance community development goals, or emphasize Iowaâs 26 diverse heritage through artwork; to increase access to arts 27 and culture in rural and underserved communities; for the 28 promotion of and investment in film, television, and video 29 projects produced in the state; and to address other goals and 30 priorities in the plan designed by the IEDA. The enhancement 31 fund consists of moneys appropriated by the general assembly 32 and any other moneys that are lawfully available to the IEDA. 33 Each fiscal year, $520,000 is appropriated from gambling 34 and sports wagering taxes to the IEDA for deposit in the 35 -22- LSB 1410SZ (2) 91 nls/ko 22/ 23 S.F. 622 enhancement fund. The IEDA may establish and adopt by rule 1 eligibility and priority criteria for allocation of moneys in 2 the enhancement fund. 3 The Iowa arts council (arts council) may elect a chairperson 4 and vice chairperson from the members of the arts council, 5 rather than being designated by the governor under current law. 6 In addition to duties under current law, the arts council is 7 required to recommend programs to ensure that Iowa citizens and 8 communities have access to the cultural, civic, economic, and 9 educational benefits of the arts. 10 The bill repeals Code sections 15.437 through 15.441, 15.476 11 through 15.479, 15.481, and 15.482, eliminating the Iowa 12 cultural trust Act, including the Iowa cultural trust, trust 13 fund, grant account, and board of trustees, and eliminates the 14 arts and cultural conferences and caucuses, the cultural and 15 entertainment districts, the Iowa great places program and 16 fund, and the culture, history, and arts teams program. 17 On the effective date of this division of the bill, all 18 unencumbered and unobligated moneys remaining in the Iowa 19 great places program fund, Iowa cultural trust fund, and Iowa 20 cultural trust grant account are transferred to the arts and 21 culture enhancement fund established in the bill. 22 Division IX makes conforming changes to Code sections 16.6 23 and 16.64. 24 Under division X, if in addition to meeting the other 25 requirements under current law, a district approved on or after 26 July 1, 2020, consists of contiguous parcels and no more than 27 125 acres, the district may be eligible to be designated as 28 a reinvestment district. This division of the bill applies 29 retroactively to July 1, 2020. 30 -23- LSB 1410SZ (2) 91 nls/ko 23/ 23

RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY. This division of this 26 Act applies retroactively to July 1, 2020. 27 EXPLANATION 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 29 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 30 This bill relates to matters under the purview of the 31 economic development authority and the Iowa finance authority 32 including the strategic infrastructure program, brownfield, 33 grayfield, and redevelopment tax credits, community attraction 34 and tourism, vision Iowa, sports tourism marketing, the 35 -17- LSB 1410SZ (2) 91 nls/ko 17/ 23 S.F. 622 historic preservation tax credit, homelessness, the title 1 guaranty board, arts and culture, and the Iowa reinvestment 2 Act. 3 Division I eliminates the requirement that the Iowa 4 innovation council review and make recommendations on all 5 applications received by the Iowa economic development 6 authority (IEDA) for financial assistance under the Iowa 7 strategic infrastructure program, and instead requires a 8 committee appointed by the IEDA director to conduct a review 9 and make recommendations. 10 Division II repeals the brownfield redevelopment program, 11 fund, and advisory council (council). 12 The bill requires that the amount of a redevelopment tax 13 credit be determined by members of the IEDA appointed by the 14 governor (the board), rather than determined by the board 15 in conjunction with the council as required under current 16 law. The IEDA shall accept and review applications for the 17 redevelopment tax credit and make award recommendations to 18 the board, rather than accept and review applications in 19 conjunction with the council as required under current law. 20 IEDA may engage outside experts to complete a technical, 21 financial, or other review. The bill makes conforming changes 22 related to elimination of the council. 23 Under current law, upon completion of a registered project 24 for redevelopment tax credits, an audit of the project 25 completed by an independent certified public accountant (CPA) 26 shall be submitted to the IEDA. Under the bill, the investor 27 shall engage a CPA to conduct an examination of the project 28 and submit the examination, and a statement of the amount of 29 final qualifying investments, to the IEDA. Upon review of the 30 examination and statement, the IEDA may issue a tax credit 31 certificate to the investor. 32 On the effective date of the bill, all unencumbered and 33 unobligated moneys remaining in the brownfield redevelopment 34 fund are transferred to a fund or funds established pursuant to 35 -18- LSB 1410SZ (2) 91 nls/ko 18/ 23 S.F. 622 Code section 15.335B, as determined by the IEDA. 1 Division III eliminates the requirement that an applicant 2 awarded financial assistance under both the vision Iowa program 3 and the community attraction and tourism program provide and 4 pay at least 50 percent of the cost of a standard medical 5 insurance plan for all full-time employees after the completion 6 of the project for which financial assistance was received. 7 This division applies to applicants awarded financial 8 assistance under both programs on or after the effective date 9 of the bill, and applies retroactively to applicants awarded 10 financial assistance under both programs prior to the effective 11 date of the bill. 12 Under division IV, the director of the IEDA shall appoint a 13 review committee composed of members with relevant expertise to 14 review community attraction and tourism program applications 15 and sports tourism marketing and infrastructure program 16 applications. Under current law, the review committee is 17 composed of five members of the IEDA board. 18 Division V requires, in addition to existing requirements 19 for the historic preservation tax credit program (historic 20 tax program) under current law, for a project for the 21 rehabilitation of property to be considered a âqualified 22 rehabilitation projectâ (project), that the property not be a 23 single-family dwelling unit, unless the project will result 24 in two or more new single-family dwelling units that were 25 not available for occupancy for at least six months prior to 26 the project, and the dwelling units are located in the same 27 neighborhood as confirmed by the IEDA. The single-family 28 dwelling units must be made available for occupancy as a result 29 of the project. The IEDA may promulgate rules that specify the 30 criteria used to determine if a property is a single-family 31 dwelling unit, and to determine if a property is a qualified 32 rehabilitation project. 33 Currently, the refundability of a historic preservation tax 34 credit in excess of tax liability is gradually reduced until 35 -19- LSB 1410SZ (2) 91 nls/ko 19/ 23 S.F. 622 the tax credit is 75 percent refundable for tax years beginning 1 on or after January 1, 2027. The bill strikes the gradual 2 reduction of the tax credit refundability and makes the tax 3 credit 100 percent refundable for tax years beginning on or 4 after January 1, 2026. The historic preservation tax credit 5 certificate is also currently transferable to another taxpayer. 6 The bill prohibits such a transfer to another taxpayer on or 7 after January 1, 2026. 8 Under current law, upon successful registration of a 9 project under the historic tax program, the eligible taxpayer 10 (taxpayer) shall enter into an agreement with the IEDA that 11 contains mutually agreeable terms and conditions including the 12 commencement date of the project, which shall not be later than 13 the end of the fiscal year in which the agreement is entered 14 into, and the completion date of the project, which shall be 15 within 36 months of the commencement date.

The taxpayer must substantiate that the requested 29 extension is warranted due to extenuating circumstances. 30 Under the bill, the IEDA may grant historic preservation 31 tax credits beyond the aggregate tax credit award limit in one 32 fiscal year if, during that fiscal year, the IEDA receives an 33 application for a project that has qualified rehabilitation 34 expenditures that, if registered, would make the taxpayer 35 -20- LSB 1410SZ (2) 91 nls/ko 20/ 23 S.F. 622 eligible for tax credits of $10 million or more. The IEDA is 1 then permitted to award tax credits during that fiscal year not 2 to exceed 20 percent more than the maximum aggregate tax credit 3 award limit.

The bill maintains the 29 responsibility for the IEDA to accept, receive, and administer 30 grants or other funds or gifts from public or private agencies; 31 to design and carry out a comprehensive, statewide, long-range 32 plan (plan) with the assistance of the Iowa arts council to 33 develop the arts in Iowa; and to establish advisory groups for 34 the receipt of federal funds or grants or the administration 35 -21- LSB 1410SZ (2) 91 nls/ko 21/ 23 S.F. 622 of the IEDAâs programs.

Additionally, the IEDA 14 is required to establish a grant program which provides 15 general operating budget support to major, multidisciplinary 16 cultural organizations that demonstrate cultural and managerial 17 excellence on a continuing basis to the citizens of Iowa. 18 Instead, the bill creates the arts and culture enhancement 19 fund (enhancement fund), under which the IEDA shall allocate 20 moneys to the fund to provide support to municipal and 21 nonprofit arts and cultural organizations that serve as 22 significant attractions or community resources; to support 23 artists and entities that foster artistic and cultural 24 expression, promote lifelong learning and engagement in the 25 arts, advance community development goals, or emphasize Iowaâs 26 diverse heritage through artwork; to increase access to arts 27 and culture in rural and underserved communities; for the 28 promotion of and investment in film, television, and video 29 projects produced in the state; and to address other goals and 30 priorities in the plan designed by the IEDA. The enhancement 31 fund consists of moneys appropriated by the general assembly 32 and any other moneys that are lawfully available to the IEDA. 33 Each fiscal year, $520,000 is appropriated from gambling 34 and sports wagering taxes to the IEDA for deposit in the 35 -22- LSB 1410SZ (2) 91 nls/ko 22/ 23 S.F. 622 enhancement fund. The IEDA may establish and adopt by rule 1 eligibility and priority criteria for allocation of moneys in 2 the enhancement fund. 3 The Iowa arts council (arts council) may elect a chairperson 4 and vice chairperson from the members of the arts council, 5 rather than being designated by the governor under current law. 6 In addition to duties under current law, the arts council is 7 required to recommend programs to ensure that Iowa citizens and 8 communities have access to the cultural, civic, economic, and 9 educational benefits of the arts. 10 The bill repeals Code sections 15.437 through 15.441, 15.476 11 through 15.479, 15.481, and 15.482, eliminating the Iowa 12 cultural trust Act, including the Iowa cultural trust, trust 13 fund, grant account, and board of trustees, and eliminates the 14 arts and cultural conferences and caucuses, the cultural and 15 entertainment districts, the Iowa great places program and 16 fund, and the culture, history, and arts teams program. 17 On the effective date of this division of the bill, all 18 unencumbered and unobligated moneys remaining in the Iowa 19 great places program fund, Iowa cultural trust fund, and Iowa 20 cultural trust grant account are transferred to the arts and 21 culture enhancement fund established in the bill. 22 Division IX makes conforming changes to Code sections 16.6 23 and 16.64. 24 Under division X, if in addition to meeting the other 25 requirements under current law, a district approved on or after 26 July 1, 2020, consists of contiguous parcels and no more than 27 125 acres, the district may be eligible to be designated as 28 a reinvestment district.
