The term âequalâ does not mean âsameâ or âidenticalâ. 3 7. Separate accommodations are not inherently unequal. 4 8. A person born with a medically verifiable diagnosis of 5 disorder or difference of sex development shall be provided the 6 legal protections and accommodations afforded under the federal 7 Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and applicable state 8 law. 9 Additionally, under the bill, any state law, policy, 10 or program that prohibits discrimination on the basis of 11 sex shall be construed to forbid unfair or discriminatory 12 practices against females or males in relation to similarly 13 situated members of the opposite sex. Notwithstanding any 14 provision of state law to the contrary, distinctions based 15 on sex in various contexts where health, safety, or privacy 16 are implicated resulting in separate accommodations, are 17 substantially related to the important government objectives of 18 protecting the health, safety, and privacy of the persons in 19 these contexts. In addition, any state department or subunit 20 of a department, or any political subdivision of the state 21 including a city, county, township, or school district that 22 collects vital statistics for the purpose of complying with 23 state antidiscrimination laws or for the purpose of gathering 24 accurate state public health, crime, economic, or other data, 25 shall identify the sex of each person included in the collected 26 data as either male or female. 27 The bill defines âstate lawâ for the purposes of new Code 28 section 4.1A. 29 The bill also amends provisions under Code chapter 144 30 (vital statistics). The bill requires that an original 31 certificate of birth include a designation of the sex of the 32 person as defined in new Code section 4.1A. With regard to 33 a new certificate of birth, if a new certificate of birth is 34 established after the state registrar receives an adoption 35 -15- LSB 2312HV (2) 91 cm/jh 15/ 16 H.F. 583 report or a certified copy of an adoption decree or following a 1 determination of paternity, the new certificate of birth must 2 include a designation of sex of the person at birth. Current 3 law requires the state registrar to establish a new certificate 4 of birth for a person upon receiving a notarized affidavit by a 5 licensed physician stating that by reason of surgery or other 6 treatment the personâs sex designation has changed. The bill 7 repeals this provision. 8 Under current law, Code chapter 216 prohibits discrimination 9 in employment, wages, public accommodations, housing, 10 education, and credit practices based upon certain 11 characteristics of a person, including gender identity. 12 A person who claims to be aggrieved by an unfair or 13 discriminatory practice prohibited by Code chapter 216 may 14 file a complaint with the Iowa civil rights commission. Code 15 chapter 216 provides various remedies for such practices. Code 16 chapter 216 defines âgender identityâ as the gender-related 17 identity of a person, regardless of the personâs assigned sex 18 at birth. 19 For purposes of Code chapter 216, the bill removes 20 gender identity as a protected class. The bill also removes 21 gender identity as a protected class in the prohibition of 22 discrimination under federal, state, and local law for charter 23 schools and innovation schools. 24 Under current Code section 279.80, school districts, 25 accredited nonpublic schools, charter schools, and innovation 26 zone schools are prohibited from providing instruction related 27 to gender identity and sexual orientation to students in 28 kindergarten through grade six. The bill replaces the term 29 âgender identityâ with the term âgender theoryâ and defines 30 âgender theoryâ. 31 The bill makes conforming changes related to the strike of 32 the definition of gender identity in the Code. 33 The bill provides that its provisions are severable pursuant 34 to Code section 4.12. 35 -16- LSB 2312HV (2) 91 cm/jh 16/ 16

SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act is 32 held invalid, the invalidity shall not affect other provisions 33 or applications of this Act which can be given effect without 34 the invalid provision or application, and to this end the 35 -13- LSB 2312HV (2) 91 cm/jh 13/ 16 H.F. 583 provisions of this Act are severable as provided in section 1 4.12. 2 EXPLANATION 3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 4 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 5 This bill relates to sex and gender, including those 6 and related terms for purposes of statutory construction, 7 indications of a personâs sex on certain vital records, gender 8 identity under the Iowa civil rights Act, and school curricula 9 related to gender theory. 10 The bill creates a new Code section 4.1A (statutory 11 construction ââ sex and related terms). The bill provides 12 that certain rules of statutory construction shall be observed 13 with regard to a personâs sex. These rules with regard to a 14 personâs sex include: 15 1. The term âsexâ, when used to classify or describe a 16 natural person, means the state of being either male or female 17 as observed or clinically verified at birth. 18 2. When used in reference to a natural person, the term 19 âfemaleâ means an individual who has, had, will have through 20 the course of normal development, or would have but for 21 a developmental anomaly, genetic anomaly, or accident, a 22 reproductive system that at some point produces ova, and 23 the term âmaleâ means an individual who has, had, will have 24 through the course of normal development, or would have but 25 for a developmental anomaly, genetic anomaly, or accident a 26 reproductive system that at some point produces sperm. 27 3. The term âwomanâ or âgirlâ refers to a female and the 28 term âmanâ or âboyâ refers to a male. 29 4. The term âmotherâ means a parent who is female and the 30 term âfatherâ means a parent who is male. 31 5. The term âgenderâ, when used alone in reference to 32 males, females, or the natural differences between males and 33 females shall be considered a synonym for sex and shall not 34 be considered a synonym or shorthand expression for gender 35 -14- LSB 2312HV (2) 91 cm/jh 14/ 16 H.F. 583 identity, experienced gender, gender expression, or gender 1 role. 2 6. The term âequalâ does not mean âsameâ or âidenticalâ. 3 7. Separate accommodations are not inherently unequal. 4 8. A person born with a medically verifiable diagnosis of 5 disorder or difference of sex development shall be provided the 6 legal protections and accommodations afforded under the federal 7 Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and applicable state 8 law. 9 Additionally, under the bill, any state law, policy, 10 or program that prohibits discrimination on the basis of 11 sex shall be construed to forbid unfair or discriminatory 12 practices against females or males in relation to similarly 13 situated members of the opposite sex. Notwithstanding any 14 provision of state law to the contrary, distinctions based 15 on sex in various contexts where health, safety, or privacy 16 are implicated resulting in separate accommodations, are 17 substantially related to the important government objectives of 18 protecting the health, safety, and privacy of the persons in 19 these contexts. In addition, any state department or subunit 20 of a department, or any political subdivision of the state 21 including a city, county, township, or school district that 22 collects vital statistics for the purpose of complying with 23 state antidiscrimination laws or for the purpose of gathering 24 accurate state public health, crime, economic, or other data, 25 shall identify the sex of each person included in the collected 26 data as either male or female. 27 The bill defines âstate lawâ for the purposes of new Code 28 section 4.1A. 29 The bill also amends provisions under Code chapter 144 30 (vital statistics). The bill requires that an original 31 certificate of birth include a designation of the sex of the 32 person as defined in new Code section 4.1A. With regard to 33 a new certificate of birth, if a new certificate of birth is 34 established after the state registrar receives an adoption 35 -15- LSB 2312HV (2) 91 cm/jh 15/ 16 H.F. 583 report or a certified copy of an adoption decree or following a 1 determination of paternity, the new certificate of birth must 2 include a designation of sex of the person at birth. Current 3 law requires the state registrar to establish a new certificate 4 of birth for a person upon receiving a notarized affidavit by a 5 licensed physician stating that by reason of surgery or other 6 treatment the personâs sex designation has changed. The bill 7 repeals this provision. 8 Under current law, Code chapter 216 prohibits discrimination 9 in employment, wages, public accommodations, housing, 10 education, and credit practices based upon certain 11 characteristics of a person, including gender identity. 12 A person who claims to be aggrieved by an unfair or 13 discriminatory practice prohibited by Code chapter 216 may 14 file a complaint with the Iowa civil rights commission. Code 15 chapter 216 provides various remedies for such practices. Code 16 chapter 216 defines âgender identityâ as the gender-related 17 identity of a person, regardless of the personâs assigned sex 18 at birth. 19 For purposes of Code chapter 216, the bill removes 20 gender identity as a protected class. The bill also removes 21 gender identity as a protected class in the prohibition of 22 discrimination under federal, state, and local law for charter 23 schools and innovation schools. 24 Under current Code section 279.80, school districts, 25 accredited nonpublic schools, charter schools, and innovation 26 zone schools are prohibited from providing instruction related 27 to gender identity and sexual orientation to students in 28 kindergarten through grade six. The bill replaces the term 29 âgender identityâ with the term âgender theoryâ and defines 30 âgender theoryâ. 31 The bill makes conforming changes related to the strike of 32 the definition of gender identity in the Code. 33 The bill provides that its provisions are severable pursuant 34 to Code section 4.12. 35 -16- LSB 2312HV (2) 91 cm/jh 16/ 16
