This bill provides for the regulation of animal 32 feeding operations by the department of natural resources 33 (DNR), including the storage and application of manure 34 originating from such operations (Code chapter 459). An animal 35 -17- LSB 2913YC (4) 91 da/ns 17/ 23 H.F. _____ feeding operation is an area or building in which agricultural 1 animals (cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys, or 2 fish) are confined for 45 days or more in any 12-month period, 3 and all associated structures used for the storage of manure. 4 A confinement feeding operation is an animal feeding operation 5 in which animals are confined to areas which are totally 6 roofed. Another form of animal feeding operation is an open 7 feedlot operation which confines animals without a roof or a 8 partial roof regulated by DNR (Code chapter 459A) and a dry 9 bedded confinement feeding operation which confines animals in 10 so-called hooped buildings (Code chapter 459B). 11 BACKGROUND ââ REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. Regulatory 12 requirements that apply to an animal feeding operation include 13 a number of requirements governing associated structures 14 including a confinement building housing agricultural animals, 15 and various types of structures storing manure which may be 16 made of material like concrete (formed) or that are primarily 17 earthen (unformed) and which may or may not be covered. The 18 regulations apply to manure in both a solid and liquid state. 19 The regulations also apply to certain manure storage structures 20 that are anaerobic in which liquid manure is stored in a manner 21 that utilizes bacteria to break down organic matter in the 22 absence of oxygen. This process creates a biogas which is 23 a type of renewable fuel as well as a digestate which is a 24 rich source of nutrients for application on cropland. Code 25 chapter 459 includes a number of subchapters, including those 26 that regulate air quality and water quality. In both cases, 27 the regulations require separation distance requirements 28 between an animal feeding operation structure, including a 29 manure storage structure, and certain objects and locations. 30 For purposes of air quality regulations, these objects or 31 locations include a residence, commercial enterprise, a bona 32 fide religious institution, an educational institution, or 33 public road. Air quality regulations also impose greater 34 separation distance requirements based on the date of initial 35 -18- LSB 2913YC (4) 91 da/ns 18/ 23 H.F. _____ construction and size of the confinement feeding operation. 1 Water quality regulations include requirements for the issuance 2 of construction permits, and construction design standards for 3 manure storage structures. Water quality requirements also 4 impose separation distances between animal feeding operation 5 structures or dry manure stockpiles and certain water sources. 6 A person applying manure originating from an animal feeding 7 operation must file a plan with DNR that demonstrates how 8 manure is to be applied in a manner that preserves water 9 quality. For confinement feeding operations, the plan is 10 referred to as a manure management plan (MMP) and for open 11 feedlots the plan is referred to as a nutrient management plan 12 (NMP). 13 BACKGROUND ââ CIVIL PENALTIES. A person who violates an air 14 quality regulation or water quality regulation is subject to a 15 civil penalty based on a schedule established by DNR rule. The 16 civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000 per violation. The civil 17 penalty for a water quality violation may also be subject to 18 a judicial civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each day of 19 such violation. 20 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ GENERAL. The bill provides for the 21 regulation of an anaerobic digester system which must include a 22 digestate processing structure that primarily processes manure 23 but may also process other organic feedstocks, referred to as 24 digester feedstock. The structure is used to produce a biogas 25 which is a source of renewable fuel and a digestate which is a 26 nutrient-rich material that may be applied to cropland in a dry 27 or liquid state. 28 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ ANAEROBIC DIGESTER SYSTEM. An 29 anaerobic digester system is comprised of three steps. The 30 first step involves the storing of organic material (manure 31 and other organic feedstock) in a dry or liquid state awaiting 32 digestion. Manure is stored in a manure storage structure 33 unless it is dry and temporarily stored as a stockpile. Liquid 34 digester feedstock is stored in a digester feedstock storage 35 -19- LSB 2913YC (4) 91 da/ns 19/ 23 H.F. _____ structure. All nonfarm digester feedstock must be stored in a 1 digester feedstock storage structure. The second step involves 2 digesting the organic material in a structure designed for 3 that purpose. The third step involves storing and applying 4 the processed organic material referred to as digestate. Dry 5 digestate may be stockpiled and liquid digestate must be 6 contained in a liquid digestate storage structure. The scope 7 of the bill is limited to the on-farm construction, including 8 expansion, of these structures, the on-farm use of stockpiles, 9 and the on-farm application of digestates. 10 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ TERMINOLOGY. The bill provides that 11 an anaerobic digester system must be identified with an animal 12 feeding operation. Identification occurs only if the anaerobic 13 digester system and the animal feeding operation are either (1) 14 under common ownership or management or (2) adjacent. In order 15 for an enforcement action to proceed against the anaerobic 16 digester system and its identified animal feeding operation 17 for the same violation, the anaerobic digester system and 18 the identified animal feeding operation must be under common 19 ownership or management and be adjacent. Any reference in the 20 bill to a digester structure means a covered digester feedstock 21 storage structure, a covered digestate processing structure, or 22 a covered liquid digestate storage structure. Any reference 23 to a digester stockpile refers to a dry digester feedstock 24 stockpile or a dry digestate stockpile. Any reference to 25 manure includes manure stored and discharged from a confinement 26 feeding operation and effluent stored and discharged from an 27 open feeding operation structure. A digester feedstock or 28 digestate is classified as dry only if digester feedstock or 29 digestate does not flow perceptibly under pressure, is not 30 capable of being transported through a mechanical pumping 31 device designed to move a liquid, and consists of molecules 32 that do not flow freely among themselves. A digestate 33 processing structure must process manure as its primary source. 34 A digestate is not to be regulated as manure, unless it is 35 -20- LSB 2913YC (4) 91 da/ns 20/ 23 H.F. _____ combined with manure. 1 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ CONSTRUCTION OF STRUCTURES. The 2 bill provides that a construction permit must be issued by 3 DNR prior to the construction of a digester structure. The 4 requirements are based on construction permit requirements 5 for manure storage structures. The application must include 6 an engineering report, construction plans, and specifications 7 prepared by a professional engineer or the natural resources 8 conservation service of the United States department of 9 agriculture. An application for a digester feedstock storage 10 structure must include information regarding the digester 11 feedstock to be stored and the digestate processing structure. 12 An application for the digestate processing structure must 13 include information regarding the ownership or management 14 of its identified animal feeding operation, and the legal 15 relationship between the two entities. It must also include 16 information regarding how digestate is to be applied, and how 17 records are to be maintained for DNR inspection. The bill 18 also provides for construction design standards for a formed 19 or unformed digester structure. The construction design 20 standards must be based on uniform standards such as available 21 standards promulgated by ASTM (American society for testing and 22 materials) international. The design standards for unformed 23 digester feedstock storage structures must account for the use 24 of linings and erosion controls. 25 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ AIR QUALITY ââ SEPARATION DISTANCE 26 REQUIREMENTS. The bill provides separation distance 27 requirements as part of air quality and water quality 28 standards. For air quality standards, the separation distance 29 requirements assume the anaerobic digester system and the 30 identified confinement feeding operation are part of a single 31 confinement feeding operation. The separation distance is 32 determined according to the date that the digester structure 33 was constructed or expanded subject to provisions allowing the 34 expansion of prior constructed confinement feeding operations 35 -21- LSB 2913YC (4) 91 da/ns 21/ 23 H.F. _____ and exceptions to those separation distance requirements. 1 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ WATER QUALITY ââ MANURE MANAGEMENT. 2 The bill provides that if digestate is applied on land subject 3 to an MMP or NMP, such plan must be attached with a second 4 document referred to as a digestate management supplement. 5 The digestate management supplement must include information 6 necessary to determine the land area required for the 7 application of the digestate and the nutrient concentrations 8 of the digestate. 9 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ WATER QUALITY ââ SEPARATION DISTANCE 10 REQUIREMENTS. The bill provides that the separation distance 11 requirements and exceptions to those separation distance 12 requirements that apply to a confinement feeding operation 13 structure and an object or location also apply to a digester 14 structure and that same object or location. The bill allows a 15 person to stockpile dry digester feedstocks or dry digestate 16 in the same manner as manure, subject to the same separation 17 distance requirements as manure. The bill requires that a 18 person must remove stockpiled dry digestate and apply it in the 19 same manner as manure. 20 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ WATER QUALITY ââ SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS. 21 The bill includes special requirements for stockpiling dry 22 digestate on certain karst terrain that are the same as 23 requirements for stockpiling dry manure. The bill also 24 provides for applying dry digestate on snow-covered or frozen 25 ground in compliance with state and federal water quality 26 standards. 27 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ EFFECTIVE DATE. The bill takes effect 28 upon enactment. 29 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ APPLICABILITY OF REGULATORY PRACTICE. 30 The bill requires DNR to regulate activities related to the 31 construction, expansion, and operation of anaerobic digester 32 systems in substantially the same manner DNR regulated 33 those activities on March 1, 2025, until the director of DNR 34 publishes a statement in the Iowa administrative bulletin 35 -22- LSB 2913YC (4) 91 da/ns 22/ 23 H.F. _____ stating that all rules required to effectively administer and 1 enforce the provisions of the bill have been adopted. 2 -23- LSB 2913YC (4) 91 da/ns 23/ 23

This bill provides for the regulation of animal 32 feeding operations by the department of natural resources 33 (DNR), including the storage and application of manure 34 originating from such operations (Code chapter 459). An animal 35 -17- LSB 2913YC (4) 91 da/ns 17/ 23 H.F. _____ feeding operation is an area or building in which agricultural 1 animals (cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys, or 2 fish) are confined for 45 days or more in any 12-month period, 3 and all associated structures used for the storage of manure. 4 A confinement feeding operation is an animal feeding operation 5 in which animals are confined to areas which are totally 6 roofed. Another form of animal feeding operation is an open 7 feedlot operation which confines animals without a roof or a 8 partial roof regulated by DNR (Code chapter 459A) and a dry 9 bedded confinement feeding operation which confines animals in 10 so-called hooped buildings (Code chapter 459B). 11 BACKGROUND ââ REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. Regulatory 12 requirements that apply to an animal feeding operation include 13 a number of requirements governing associated structures 14 including a confinement building housing agricultural animals, 15 and various types of structures storing manure which may be 16 made of material like concrete (formed) or that are primarily 17 earthen (unformed) and which may or may not be covered. The 18 regulations apply to manure in both a solid and liquid state. 19 The regulations also apply to certain manure storage structures 20 that are anaerobic in which liquid manure is stored in a manner 21 that utilizes bacteria to break down organic matter in the 22 absence of oxygen. This process creates a biogas which is 23 a type of renewable fuel as well as a digestate which is a 24 rich source of nutrients for application on cropland. Code 25 chapter 459 includes a number of subchapters, including those 26 that regulate air quality and water quality. In both cases, 27 the regulations require separation distance requirements 28 between an animal feeding operation structure, including a 29 manure storage structure, and certain objects and locations. 30 For purposes of air quality regulations, these objects or 31 locations include a residence, commercial enterprise, a bona 32 fide religious institution, an educational institution, or 33 public road. Air quality regulations also impose greater 34 separation distance requirements based on the date of initial 35 -18- LSB 2913YC (4) 91 da/ns 18/ 23 H.F. _____ construction and size of the confinement feeding operation. 1 Water quality regulations include requirements for the issuance 2 of construction permits, and construction design standards for 3 manure storage structures. Water quality requirements also 4 impose separation distances between animal feeding operation 5 structures or dry manure stockpiles and certain water sources. 6 A person applying manure originating from an animal feeding 7 operation must file a plan with DNR that demonstrates how 8 manure is to be applied in a manner that preserves water 9 quality. For confinement feeding operations, the plan is 10 referred to as a manure management plan (MMP) and for open 11 feedlots the plan is referred to as a nutrient management plan 12 (NMP). 13 BACKGROUND ââ CIVIL PENALTIES. A person who violates an air 14 quality regulation or water quality regulation is subject to a 15 civil penalty based on a schedule established by DNR rule. The 16 civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000 per violation. The civil 17 penalty for a water quality violation may also be subject to 18 a judicial civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each day of 19 such violation. 20 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ GENERAL. The bill provides for the 21 regulation of an anaerobic digester system which must include a 22 digestate processing structure that primarily processes manure 23 but may also process other organic feedstocks, referred to as 24 digester feedstock. The structure is used to produce a biogas 25 which is a source of renewable fuel and a digestate which is a 26 nutrient-rich material that may be applied to cropland in a dry 27 or liquid state. 28 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ ANAEROBIC DIGESTER SYSTEM. An 29 anaerobic digester system is comprised of three steps. The 30 first step involves the storing of organic material (manure 31 and other organic feedstock) in a dry or liquid state awaiting 32 digestion. Manure is stored in a manure storage structure 33 unless it is dry and temporarily stored as a stockpile. Liquid 34 digester feedstock is stored in a digester feedstock storage 35 -19- LSB 2913YC (4) 91 da/ns 19/ 23 H.F. _____ structure. All nonfarm digester feedstock must be stored in a 1 digester feedstock storage structure. The second step involves 2 digesting the organic material in a structure designed for 3 that purpose. The third step involves storing and applying 4 the processed organic material referred to as digestate. Dry 5 digestate may be stockpiled and liquid digestate must be 6 contained in a liquid digestate storage structure. The scope 7 of the bill is limited to the on-farm construction, including 8 expansion, of these structures, the on-farm use of stockpiles, 9 and the on-farm application of digestates. 10 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ TERMINOLOGY. The bill provides that 11 an anaerobic digester system must be identified with an animal 12 feeding operation. Identification occurs only if the anaerobic 13 digester system and the animal feeding operation are either (1) 14 under common ownership or management or (2) adjacent. In order 15 for an enforcement action to proceed against the anaerobic 16 digester system and its identified animal feeding operation 17 for the same violation, the anaerobic digester system and 18 the identified animal feeding operation must be under common 19 ownership or management and be adjacent. Any reference in the 20 bill to a digester structure means a covered digester feedstock 21 storage structure, a covered digestate processing structure, or 22 a covered liquid digestate storage structure. Any reference 23 to a digester stockpile refers to a dry digester feedstock 24 stockpile or a dry digestate stockpile. Any reference to 25 manure includes manure stored and discharged from a confinement 26 feeding operation and effluent stored and discharged from an 27 open feeding operation structure. A digester feedstock or 28 digestate is classified as dry only if digester feedstock or 29 digestate does not flow perceptibly under pressure, is not 30 capable of being transported through a mechanical pumping 31 device designed to move a liquid, and consists of molecules 32 that do not flow freely among themselves. A digestate 33 processing structure must process manure as its primary source. 34 A digestate is not to be regulated as manure, unless it is 35 -20- LSB 2913YC (4) 91 da/ns 20/ 23 H.F. _____ combined with manure. 1 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ CONSTRUCTION OF STRUCTURES. The 2 bill provides that a construction permit must be issued by 3 DNR prior to the construction of a digester structure. The 4 requirements are based on construction permit requirements 5 for manure storage structures. The application must include 6 an engineering report, construction plans, and specifications 7 prepared by a professional engineer or the natural resources 8 conservation service of the United States department of 9 agriculture. An application for a digester feedstock storage 10 structure must include information regarding the digester 11 feedstock to be stored and the digestate processing structure. 12 An application for the digestate processing structure must 13 include information regarding the ownership or management 14 of its identified animal feeding operation, and the legal 15 relationship between the two entities. It must also include 16 information regarding how digestate is to be applied, and how 17 records are to be maintained for DNR inspection. The bill 18 also provides for construction design standards for a formed 19 or unformed digester structure. The construction design 20 standards must be based on uniform standards such as available 21 standards promulgated by ASTM (American society for testing and 22 materials) international. The design standards for unformed 23 digester feedstock storage structures must account for the use 24 of linings and erosion controls. 25 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ AIR QUALITY ââ SEPARATION DISTANCE 26 REQUIREMENTS. The bill provides separation distance 27 requirements as part of air quality and water quality 28 standards. For air quality standards, the separation distance 29 requirements assume the anaerobic digester system and the 30 identified confinement feeding operation are part of a single 31 confinement feeding operation. The separation distance is 32 determined according to the date that the digester structure 33 was constructed or expanded subject to provisions allowing the 34 expansion of prior constructed confinement feeding operations 35 -21- LSB 2913YC (4) 91 da/ns 21/ 23 H.F. _____ and exceptions to those separation distance requirements. 1 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ WATER QUALITY ââ MANURE MANAGEMENT. 2 The bill provides that if digestate is applied on land subject 3 to an MMP or NMP, such plan must be attached with a second 4 document referred to as a digestate management supplement. 5 The digestate management supplement must include information 6 necessary to determine the land area required for the 7 application of the digestate and the nutrient concentrations 8 of the digestate. 9 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ WATER QUALITY ââ SEPARATION DISTANCE 10 REQUIREMENTS. The bill provides that the separation distance 11 requirements and exceptions to those separation distance 12 requirements that apply to a confinement feeding operation 13 structure and an object or location also apply to a digester 14 structure and that same object or location. The bill allows a 15 person to stockpile dry digester feedstocks or dry digestate 16 in the same manner as manure, subject to the same separation 17 distance requirements as manure. The bill requires that a 18 person must remove stockpiled dry digestate and apply it in the 19 same manner as manure. 20 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ WATER QUALITY ââ SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS. 21 The bill includes special requirements for stockpiling dry 22 digestate on certain karst terrain that are the same as 23 requirements for stockpiling dry manure. The bill also 24 provides for applying dry digestate on snow-covered or frozen 25 ground in compliance with state and federal water quality 26 standards. 27 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ EFFECTIVE DATE. The bill takes effect 28 upon enactment. 29 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ APPLICABILITY OF REGULATORY PRACTICE. 30 The bill requires DNR to regulate activities related to the 31 construction, expansion, and operation of anaerobic digester 32 systems in substantially the same manner DNR regulated 33 those activities on March 1, 2025, until the director of DNR 34 publishes a statement in the Iowa administrative bulletin 35 -22- LSB 2913YC (4) 91 da/ns 22/ 23 H.F. _____ stating that all rules required to effectively administer and 1 enforce the provisions of the bill have been adopted. 2 -23- LSB 2913YC (4) 91 da/ns 23/ 23
