The 25 commission shall instruct appointed inspectors of the content 26 of the statutes and rules and the inspectorsâ responsibility to 27 require compliant construction. 28 The bill modifies surety bond amounts for projects 29 constructed pursuant to Code chapters 479 and 479B. The 30 bill changes the amount that an applicant for a permit shall 31 demonstrate in property value in Iowa (other than pipelines) 32 to more than $1 million rather than $250,000. The applicant 33 may instead file and maintain with the commission a surety bond 34 of $1 million or 1 percent of the project value, whichever is 35 -22- LSB 2733XC (1) 91 sc/js 22/ 23 S.F. _____ lesser, rather than a surety bond of $250,000. 1 The bill is effective upon enactment and includes 2 applicability provisions.
