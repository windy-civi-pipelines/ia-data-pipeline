In awarding a contract in connection with a large-scale 20 construction project, or in obligating funds pursuant to such a 21 contract, a state agency, on a project-by-project basis, may 22 require the use of a project labor agreement when the use will 23 advance the stateâs interest. In making the decision whether 24 to use a project labor agreement, the state agency shall 25 consider the following factors: 26 a. The potential for a labor disruption, such as a strike, 27 lockout, or slowdown, that could affect the timely completion 28 of the project. 29 b.

The decision to use a project labor 12 agreement shall be supported by written findings by the 13 affected state agency that demonstrate how the use of a project 14 labor agreement will benefit the stateâs interest, particularly 15 with respect to the factors enumerated in subsection 3. 16 5. A project labor agreement reached pursuant to this 17 section shall do all of the following: 18 a. Bind all contractors and subcontractors on the 19 large-scale construction project through the inclusion of 20 appropriate specifications in all relevant solicitation 21 provisions and contract documents. 22 b.

The 12 bill defines a âproject labor agreementâ as a comprehensive 13 pre-hire collective bargaining agreement that is negotiated 14 between a projectâs owner and an appropriate labor organization 15 and sets out the basic terms and working conditions for 16 that particular project. The bill defines a âlarge-scale 17 construction projectâ as the construction, rehabilitation, 18 alteration, conversion, extension, repair, or improvement of 19 a vertical public works project, including a building and 20 other real property-related project, for which the total 21 project cost is $25 million or more. The bill authorizes a 22 state agency to require the use of a project labor agreement 23 when the use will advance the stateâs interest. The bill 24 sets out certain factors for making such a decision.
