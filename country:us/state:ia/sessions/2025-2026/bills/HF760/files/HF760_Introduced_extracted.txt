However, if a remonstrance 9 has been filed with the clerk signed by at least 25 percent of 10 all owners of property within the proposed area representing 11 ownership of at least 25 percent or more of the total number of 12 cultural or entertainment establishments, food establishments, 13 liquor establishments, and lodging providers in the proposed 14 area, the adoption of the ordinance requires a unanimous vote 15 of the council.

The 3 bill establishes a process and timing for imposition or repeal 4 of the surcharge and for dissolution of the area. 5 The bill specifies the director of the department of 6 revenue shall administer the surcharge as nearly as possible 7 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales tax. 8 The bill specifies that administrative and enforcement laws 9 relating to the sales tax apply to surcharges imposed under the 10 bill. The bill requires each city to assist the department in 11 identifying new establishments required to impose the surcharge 12 in the area. 13 The bill creates a state surcharge revenue fund in the 14 state treasury under the control of the department of revenue 15 consisting of surcharge revenues collected within each area. 16 The bill creates an area account for each city creating an 17 area. The bill requires the revenues be deposited into the 18 appropriate area account. All revenues in each area account 19 shall be remitted monthly by the department to the city that 20 established the area for deposit in the entertainment area 21 fund of the city. Surcharge revenues deposited into the 22 cityâs entertainment area fund may be deposited in any of 23 the following funds: the debt service fund in Code section 24 384.4, or the capital improvements fund in Code section 384.7. 25 If the surcharge revenues are not deposited in any of the 26 above-mentioned funds, the surcharge revenues may also be 27 used for any of the purposes described under Code section 28 384.3A(3)(b), (c), (e), (f), or (g). 29 -13- LSB 1315HV (1) 91 jm/jh 13/ 13

The 3 bill establishes a process and timing for imposition or repeal 4 of the surcharge and for dissolution of the area. 5 The bill specifies the director of the department of 6 revenue shall administer the surcharge as nearly as possible 7 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales tax. 8 The bill specifies that administrative and enforcement laws 9 relating to the sales tax apply to surcharges imposed under the 10 bill. The bill requires each city to assist the department in 11 identifying new establishments required to impose the surcharge 12 in the area. 13 The bill creates a state surcharge revenue fund in the 14 state treasury under the control of the department of revenue 15 consisting of surcharge revenues collected within each area. 16 The bill creates an area account for each city creating an 17 area. The bill requires the revenues be deposited into the 18 appropriate area account. All revenues in each area account 19 shall be remitted monthly by the department to the city that 20 established the area for deposit in the entertainment area 21 fund of the city. Surcharge revenues deposited into the 22 cityâs entertainment area fund may be deposited in any of 23 the following funds: the debt service fund in Code section 24 384.4, or the capital improvements fund in Code section 384.7. 25 If the surcharge revenues are not deposited in any of the 26 above-mentioned funds, the surcharge revenues may also be 27 used for any of the purposes described under Code section 28 384.3A(3)(b), (c), (e), (f), or (g). 29 -13- LSB 1315HV (1) 91 jm/jh 13/ 13
