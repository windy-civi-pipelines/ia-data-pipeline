1 Section 1. Section 321E.12, subsection 1, Code 2025, is
2 amended to read as follows:
3 1. a. A vehicle traveling under permit shall be registered
4 for the gross weight of the vehicle and load. A trip permit
5 issued according to section 326.23 shall not be used in lieu of
6 the registration provided for in this section.
7 b. For purposes of this section, a vehicle traveling
8 under a single-trip permit issued under section 321E.9 may be
9 registered with the department for the combined gross weight
10 of the vehicle and load on a single-trip basis. The fee for
11 single-trip registration is four dollars per ton exceeding
12 forty tons.
13 EXPLANATION
14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
15 the explanationâ€™s substance by the members of the general assembly.
16 Under current law, the department of transportation (DOT)
17 and local authorities are authorized to issue single-trip
18 permits for the movement of vehicles that exceed established
19 dimensions and weight limits (Code section 321E.9). A vehicle
20 traveling under an oversize or overweight permit is required
21 to be registered for the gross weight of the vehicle and load.
22 The owner of a commercial vehicle, which is properly registered
23 and licensed in some other jurisdiction and also operated
24 occasionally in Iowa, who pays the $10 trip permit fee that
25 otherwise authorizes a commercial vehicle not registered in
26 Iowa to be operated in Iowa for up to 72 hours, in accordance
27 with Code section 326.23, cannot use that trip permit in
28 lieu of the oversize or overweight vehicle registration
29 requirements.
30 This bill authorizes a vehicle traveling under a single-trip
31 permit to be registered with the DOT on a single-trip basis for
32 the combined gross weight of the vehicle and load. The fee for
33 single-trip registration is $4 per ton exceeding 40 tons. The
34 bill strikes the prohibition on using a Code section 326.23
35 trip permit in lieu of registration.
