22 EXPLANATION
23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
24 the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
25 This bill relates to the Iowa lottery.
26 The bill removes the word “on-line” from the term “on-line
27 lotto”, strikes reporting requirements duplicative of
28 those under Code section 99G.40, and moves duties of the
29 administrator of the Iowa lottery regarding conducting hearings
30 and administering oaths to assure the security or integrity of
31 the lottery to the director of revenue (director). The bill
32 specifies that the Iowa lottery commission is prohibited from
33 adopting policies, procedures, or rules that relate to the
34 department of revenue (IDR) in general, and removes from the
35 suggested policies, procedures, and rules that lottery drawings
LSB 1391XD (2) 91

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 be witnessed by an independent certified public accountant.
2 Under current law, IDR is prohibited from hiring
3 persons convicted of a felony, bookmaking, other form of
4 illegal gambling, or a crime involving moral turpitude for
5 lottery-related employment. The bill removes crimes involving
6 moral turpitude from the prohibition and gives the director
7 discretion to determine the relevance of other crimes on
8 employment decisions.
9 The bill updates and expands the list of persons prohibited
10 from purchasing a lottery ticket or being awarded a prize,
11 including by adding a state officer or employee providing
12 services to IDR to administer lottery provisions if such person
13 has access to confidential information which may compromise the
14 integrity of the lottery.
15 The bill adds ticket order history, ticket inventory, or any
16 other records that could affect the security, integrity, or
17 fairness of a lottery game or the security of lottery retailers
18 to the list of exceptions to an open records request governed
19 by Code chapter 22.
20 The bill changes lottery security staff requirements to
21 include investigators that support the division and updates the
22 activities performed by investigators supporting the lottery
23 division.
24 Under current law, the director of the department of
25 management is prohibited from including lottery revenues in
26 fiscal year revenue estimates. The bill specifies that this is
27 for general fund revenue estimates, and that the prohibition
28 does not apply for purposes of Code section 8.22A (revenue
29 estimating conference).
30 Under current law, the director is required to certify
31 quarterly that portion of the lottery fund that has been
32 transferred to the general fund and to transfer that portion
33 to the general fund. The administrator of the Iowa lottery
34 is required to transfer proceeds from the lottery fund to the
35 general fund within 30 days following the end of the quarter.

4 director.

1 The director shall certify before the last day of the month
2 following each quarter that portion of the lottery fund
3 resulting from the previous quarter’s sales to be transferred
4 to the general fund of the state. The director shall certify
5 quarterly that portion of the fund that has been transferred
6 to the general fund of the state under this chapter and shall
7 cause that portion to be transferred to the general fund of the
8 state within forty-five days following the end of the quarter.
9 However, upon the request of the director and subject to the
10 approval by the treasurer of state, an amount sufficient to
11 cover the foreseeable administrative expenses of the lottery
12 for a period of twenty-one days may be retained from the
13 lottery fund. Prior to the quarterly transfer to the general
14 fund of the state, the director may direct that lottery revenue
15 shall be deposited in the lottery fund and in interest-bearing
16 accounts designated by the treasurer of state. Interest or
17 earnings paid on the deposits or investments is considered
18 lottery revenue and shall be transferred to the general fund of
19 the state in the same manner as other lottery revenue.
20 Sec. 16. Section 99G.40, subsection 3, Code 2025, is amended
21 by striking the subsection.
22 EXPLANATION
23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
24 the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
25 This bill relates to the Iowa lottery.
26 The bill removes the word “on-line” from the term “on-line
27 lotto”, strikes reporting requirements duplicative of
28 those under Code section 99G.40, and moves duties of the
29 administrator of the Iowa lottery regarding conducting hearings
30 and administering oaths to assure the security or integrity of
31 the lottery to the director of revenue (director). The bill
32 specifies that the Iowa lottery commission is prohibited from
33 adopting policies, procedures, or rules that relate to the
34 department of revenue (IDR) in general, and removes from the
35 suggested policies, procedures, and rules that lottery drawings

1 be witnessed by an independent certified public accountant.
2 Under current law, IDR is prohibited from hiring
3 persons convicted of a felony, bookmaking, other form of
4 illegal gambling, or a crime involving moral turpitude for
5 lottery-related employment. The bill removes crimes involving
6 moral turpitude from the prohibition and gives the director
7 discretion to determine the relevance of other crimes on
8 employment decisions.
9 The bill updates and expands the list of persons prohibited
10 from purchasing a lottery ticket or being awarded a prize,
11 including by adding a state officer or employee providing
12 services to IDR to administer lottery provisions if such person
13 has access to confidential information which may compromise the
14 integrity of the lottery.
15 The bill adds ticket order history, ticket inventory, or any
16 other records that could affect the security, integrity, or
17 fairness of a lottery game or the security of lottery retailers
18 to the list of exceptions to an open records request governed
19 by Code chapter 22.
20 The bill changes lottery security staff requirements to
21 include investigators that support the division and updates the
22 activities performed by investigators supporting the lottery
23 division.
24 Under current law, the director of the department of
25 management is prohibited from including lottery revenues in
26 fiscal year revenue estimates. The bill specifies that this is
27 for general fund revenue estimates, and that the prohibition
28 does not apply for purposes of Code section 8.22A (revenue
29 estimating conference).
30 Under current law, the director is required to certify
31 quarterly that portion of the lottery fund that has been
32 transferred to the general fund and to transfer that portion
33 to the general fund. The administrator of the Iowa lottery
34 is required to transfer proceeds from the lottery fund to the
35 general fund within 30 days following the end of the quarter.
