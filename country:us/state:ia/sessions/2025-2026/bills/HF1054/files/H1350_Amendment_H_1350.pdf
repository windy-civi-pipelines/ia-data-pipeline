33 a business from expanding the business’s operations in a
34 community if the business has similar operations in this state
35 that are not closing or undergoing a substantial reduction in

12 laws or rules.
13 (2) If the authority determines that the business has a
14 record of violations described in subparagraph (1), and the
15 authority finds that the violations did not seriously affect
