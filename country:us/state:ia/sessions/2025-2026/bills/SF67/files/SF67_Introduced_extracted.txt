If an action was previously dismissed before 15 the effective date of the bill on the grounds that it was 16 time-barred or because the party failed to file a petition, the 17 party shall have a right to file a revival action. 18 The bill provides that the district court shall try civil 19 cases in the order in which cases are initiated by the filing 20 of a petition, but entitles cases to preference if the cases 21 have been revived pursuant to Code section 614.1(12)(b) or 22 Code section 615.8A(2) or actions in which the interests of 23 justice, as determined by the supreme court, will be served by 24 early trial.
