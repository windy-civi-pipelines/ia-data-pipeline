Current law requires the director of 9 the department of education to develop and distribute to school 10 districts, accredited nonpublic schools, and area education 11 agencies a list of evidence-based professional development 12 services that an area education agency may provide to a public 13 school or accredited nonpublic school. The bill strikes these 14 provisions. 15 Current law requires the division of special education 16 within the department of education to oversee the operation of 17 each area education agency to ensure the area education agency 18 complies with all applicable federal and state laws related to 19 special education; develop and distribute to school districts 20 and accredited nonpublic schools a process to facilitate 21 the development of individualized education programs and 22 assist individualized education program teams with decisions 23 regarding free appropriate public education and placement for 24 students enrolled in accredited nonpublic schools; provide 25 professional learning and other support materials and tools for 26 individualized education program teams; provide information 27 to individualized education program teams and public agencies 28 that nonpublic schools shall be considered a placement option 29 so long as the individualized education program of a child 30 with a disability does not require some other arrangement; 31 develop and distribute to school districts professional 32 learning and other materials for meaningful consultation for 33 representatives of area education agencies, school districts, 34 and accredited nonpublic schools; establish sustainable 35 -19- LSB 2425YH (4) 91 jda/jh 19/ 23 H.F. 914 accountability and data collection systems related to special 1 education; and develop and distribute to school districts and 2 accredited nonpublic schools an implementation plan related 3 to identifying, evaluating, and promoting strategies and 4 models for providing special education and related services 5 with accredited nonpublic schools. The bill strikes these 6 provisions. 7 DIVISION II ââ AREA EDUCATION AGENCIES ââ GENERAL 8 PROVISIONS. Current law provides that each area education 9 agency is under the general supervision of the director of the 10 department of education and that the area education agency 11 board of directors serves in an advisory capacity. The bill 12 provides that each area education agency is governed by a board 13 of directors. The bill makes conforming changes. 14 The bill modifies provisions related to students that 15 an area education agency may provide services to. Current 16 law provides that an area education agency may furnish 17 evidence-based professional development services to public or 18 nonpublic schools which are on the list of accredited schools 19 if certain specified requirements are satisfied. The bill 20 strikes this provision. 21 Current law requires area education agencies to prepare a 22 proposed annual budget and submit the proposed budget to the 23 director of the department of education for approval not later 24 than March 1 of each year. Under current law, the director is 25 required to either approve or reject the proposed budget for 26 changes within 10 days after submission. The bill modifies 27 this provision to require area education agencies to prepare 28 a proposed annual budget and post notice of a public hearing 29 on the proposed budget on the area education agencyâs internet 30 site and by publication in the newspaper of general circulation 31 in the territory of the area education agency in which the 32 principal place of business of a school district that is part 33 of the area education agency is located. The notice shall 34 specify the date, which shall be not later than March 1 of each 35 -20- LSB 2425YH (4) 91 jda/jh 20/ 23 H.F. 914 year, the time, and the location of the public hearing. 1 Current law requires an area education agency to, on a 2 quarterly basis, prepare and submit to each school district 3 that receives services from the area education agency a report 4 that includes certain specified financial and programmatic 5 information. The bill strikes this provision. 6 Current law requires that the director of special education 7 within each area education agency be an employee of the 8 division of special education of the department of education 9 and not be an employee of the area education agency, receive 10 compensation from the area education agency, supervise or 11 manage employees of the area education agency, or directly 12 provide special education services for the agency. Current law 13 also provides that the director of special educationâs primary 14 job duties and responsibilities to the area education agency 15 are to provide oversight of the area education agencyâs special 16 education services. The bill strikes these provisions. 17 The bill modifies provisions related to the standards used 18 by the state board of education for the accreditation of area 19 education agencies. 20 The bill repeals certain specified provisions of 2024 Iowa 21 Acts, chapter 1002, related to the accreditation of area 22 education programs that were to take effect July 1, 2025. 23 DIVISION III ââ AREA EDUCATION AGENCIES ââ FUNDING. The 24 bill modifies provisions related to the calculation of the area 25 education agency professional development supplement state cost 26 per pupil. 27 Current law provides that funds calculated under Code 28 section 257.10(7) (special education support services district 29 cost) and received by a school district are required to be 30 used for special education support services. Current law 31 also provides that for budget years beginning on or after 32 July 1, 2025, not less than 90 percent of funds calculated 33 under Code section 257.10(7) and received by a school district 34 are required to be used by the school district for special 35 -21- LSB 2425YH (4) 91 jda/jh 21/ 23 H.F. 914 education support services contracted from an area education 1 agency. The contract between the school district and the area 2 education agency shall not require the school district to 3 describe the specific special education support services the 4 school district will receive from the area education agency. 5 The special education services provided by the area education 6 agency to the school district pursuant to the contract shall 7 not be limited by the amount of funding the school district 8 provided to the area education agency. The bill strikes these 9 provisions. 10 The bill provides that for the fiscal year beginning July 11 1, 2025, and each fiscal year thereafter, the department of 12 management is required to deduct the amounts calculated for 13 special education support services, media services, area 14 education agency teacher salary supplement district cost, area 15 education agency professional development supplement district 16 costs, and educational services for each school district from 17 the state aid due to the district pursuant to Code chapter 18 257 and pay the amounts to the respective area education 19 agencies on a monthly basis from September 15 through June 15 20 during each school year. The bill requires the department of 21 management to notify each school district of the amount of 22 state aid deducted for these purposes and the balance of state 23 aid is required to be paid to the district. If a district 24 does not qualify for state aid under Code chapter 257 in an 25 amount sufficient to cover its amount due to the area education 26 agency as calculated by the department of management, the 27 school district is required to pay the deficiency to the area 28 education agency from other moneys received by the district, on 29 a quarterly basis during each school year. 30 Current law provides that, notwithstanding the deduction and 31 payment called for under Code section 257.35(1), the amounts 32 specified for school districts and area education agencies in 33 Code section 257.35(1)(a) for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 34 2024, and each succeeding fiscal year, shall be reduced by the 35 -22- LSB 2425YH (4) 91 jda/jh 22/ 23 H.F. 914 department of management by $7.5 million. The bill provides 1 that this reduction does not apply to fiscal years after the 2 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024. 3 The bill modifies provisions related to moneys available 4 to school districts and area education agencies for special 5 education support services and the funding and provisions 6 related to the media and educational services provided by 7 school districts or through area education agencies, including 8 by modifying Code section 257.37 (funding media and educational 9 services) to strike a provision that state funds that are not 10 required to be paid to an area education agency may be used 11 by the school district for any school district general fund 12 purpose and by modifying the definition of âenrollment servedâ 13 in Code section 257.37. 14 The bill modifies Code section 257.37A (area education 15 agency salary supplement funding), including by providing that, 16 if the department of management determines that the unadjusted 17 area education agency professional development supplement 18 district cost of an area education agency for a budget year is 19 less than 100 percent of the unadjusted area education agency 20 professional development supplement district cost for the base 21 year for the area education agency, the area education agency 22 shall receive a budget adjustment for that budget year equal 23 to the difference. 24 The division takes effect upon enactment and applies July 1, 25 2025, for school budget years beginning on or after that date. 26 -23- LSB 2425YH (4) 91 jda/jh 23/ 23

Current law requires the director of 9 the department of education to develop and distribute to school 10 districts, accredited nonpublic schools, and area education 11 agencies a list of evidence-based professional development 12 services that an area education agency may provide to a public 13 school or accredited nonpublic school. The bill strikes these 14 provisions. 15 Current law requires the division of special education 16 within the department of education to oversee the operation of 17 each area education agency to ensure the area education agency 18 complies with all applicable federal and state laws related to 19 special education; develop and distribute to school districts 20 and accredited nonpublic schools a process to facilitate 21 the development of individualized education programs and 22 assist individualized education program teams with decisions 23 regarding free appropriate public education and placement for 24 students enrolled in accredited nonpublic schools; provide 25 professional learning and other support materials and tools for 26 individualized education program teams; provide information 27 to individualized education program teams and public agencies 28 that nonpublic schools shall be considered a placement option 29 so long as the individualized education program of a child 30 with a disability does not require some other arrangement; 31 develop and distribute to school districts professional 32 learning and other materials for meaningful consultation for 33 representatives of area education agencies, school districts, 34 and accredited nonpublic schools; establish sustainable 35 -19- LSB 2425YH (4) 91 jda/jh 19/ 23 H.F. 914 accountability and data collection systems related to special 1 education; and develop and distribute to school districts and 2 accredited nonpublic schools an implementation plan related 3 to identifying, evaluating, and promoting strategies and 4 models for providing special education and related services 5 with accredited nonpublic schools. The bill strikes these 6 provisions. 7 DIVISION II ââ AREA EDUCATION AGENCIES ââ GENERAL 8 PROVISIONS. Current law provides that each area education 9 agency is under the general supervision of the director of the 10 department of education and that the area education agency 11 board of directors serves in an advisory capacity. The bill 12 provides that each area education agency is governed by a board 13 of directors. The bill makes conforming changes. 14 The bill modifies provisions related to students that 15 an area education agency may provide services to. Current 16 law provides that an area education agency may furnish 17 evidence-based professional development services to public or 18 nonpublic schools which are on the list of accredited schools 19 if certain specified requirements are satisfied. The bill 20 strikes this provision. 21 Current law requires area education agencies to prepare a 22 proposed annual budget and submit the proposed budget to the 23 director of the department of education for approval not later 24 than March 1 of each year. Under current law, the director is 25 required to either approve or reject the proposed budget for 26 changes within 10 days after submission. The bill modifies 27 this provision to require area education agencies to prepare 28 a proposed annual budget and post notice of a public hearing 29 on the proposed budget on the area education agencyâs internet 30 site and by publication in the newspaper of general circulation 31 in the territory of the area education agency in which the 32 principal place of business of a school district that is part 33 of the area education agency is located. The notice shall 34 specify the date, which shall be not later than March 1 of each 35 -20- LSB 2425YH (4) 91 jda/jh 20/ 23 H.F. 914 year, the time, and the location of the public hearing. 1 Current law requires an area education agency to, on a 2 quarterly basis, prepare and submit to each school district 3 that receives services from the area education agency a report 4 that includes certain specified financial and programmatic 5 information. The bill strikes this provision. 6 Current law requires that the director of special education 7 within each area education agency be an employee of the 8 division of special education of the department of education 9 and not be an employee of the area education agency, receive 10 compensation from the area education agency, supervise or 11 manage employees of the area education agency, or directly 12 provide special education services for the agency. Current law 13 also provides that the director of special educationâs primary 14 job duties and responsibilities to the area education agency 15 are to provide oversight of the area education agencyâs special 16 education services. The bill strikes these provisions. 17 The bill modifies provisions related to the standards used 18 by the state board of education for the accreditation of area 19 education agencies. 20 The bill repeals certain specified provisions of 2024 Iowa 21 Acts, chapter 1002, related to the accreditation of area 22 education programs that were to take effect July 1, 2025. 23 DIVISION III ââ AREA EDUCATION AGENCIES ââ FUNDING. The 24 bill modifies provisions related to the calculation of the area 25 education agency professional development supplement state cost 26 per pupil. 27 Current law provides that funds calculated under Code 28 section 257.10(7) (special education support services district 29 cost) and received by a school district are required to be 30 used for special education support services. Current law 31 also provides that for budget years beginning on or after 32 July 1, 2025, not less than 90 percent of funds calculated 33 under Code section 257.10(7) and received by a school district 34 are required to be used by the school district for special 35 -21- LSB 2425YH (4) 91 jda/jh 21/ 23 H.F. 914 education support services contracted from an area education 1 agency. The contract between the school district and the area 2 education agency shall not require the school district to 3 describe the specific special education support services the 4 school district will receive from the area education agency. 5 The special education services provided by the area education 6 agency to the school district pursuant to the contract shall 7 not be limited by the amount of funding the school district 8 provided to the area education agency. The bill strikes these 9 provisions. 10 The bill provides that for the fiscal year beginning July 11 1, 2025, and each fiscal year thereafter, the department of 12 management is required to deduct the amounts calculated for 13 special education support services, media services, area 14 education agency teacher salary supplement district cost, area 15 education agency professional development supplement district 16 costs, and educational services for each school district from 17 the state aid due to the district pursuant to Code chapter 18 257 and pay the amounts to the respective area education 19 agencies on a monthly basis from September 15 through June 15 20 during each school year.
