7 Section 1. Section 510B.1, Code 2025, is amended by adding
8 the following new subsections:
9 NEW SUBSECTION. 11A. “National average drug acquisition
10 cost” means the monthly survey of retail pharmacies conducted
11 by the federal centers for Medicare and Medicaid services
12 to determine average acquisition cost for Medicaid covered
13 outpatient drugs.
14 NEW SUBSECTION. 11B. “Pass-through pricing” means a
15 model of prescription drug pricing in which payments made
16 by a third-party payor to a pharmacy benefits manager for
17 prescription drugs are equivalent to the payments the pharmacy
18 benefits manager makes to the dispensing pharmacy or dispensing
19 health care provider for the prescription drugs, including any
20 professional dispensing fee.
21 NEW SUBSECTION. 21A. “Specialty drug” means a drug used
22 to treat chronic and complex, or rare medical conditions and
23 that requires special handling or administration, provider care
24 coordination, or patient education that cannot be provided by a
25 nonspecialty pharmacy or pharmacist.
26 NEW SUBSECTION. 21B. “Spread pricing” means a pharmacy
27 benefits manager charges a third-party payor more for
28 prescription drugs dispensed to a covered person than the
29 amount the pharmacy benefits manager reimburses the pharmacy
30 for dispensing the prescription drugs to a covered person.
31 NEW SUBSECTION. 22A. “Wholesale acquisition cost” means the
32 same as defined in 42 U.S.C. §1395w-3a(c)(6)(B).

1 pharmacy services, including prescription drugs, exclusively
2 through a mail order pharmacy. This subsection shall not apply
3 to a specialty drug.
4 2. A pharmacy benefits manager shall not unreasonably

6 a covered person from accessing the prescription drug, or
7 limiting a covered person’s access to the prescription drug,
8 from a pharmacy or pharmacist that is within the health
9 carrier’s network. A covered person or pharmacy harmed by an
10 alleged violation of this subsection may file a complaint with
11 the commissioner and the commissioner shall, in consultation
12 with the board of pharmacy, make a determination if the covered
13 prescription drug meets the definition of specialty drug.

4 drug is unavailable on the date that the prescription drug is
5 administered or dispensed, a pharmacy benefits manager shall
6 not reimburse any pharmacy located in the state in an amount
7 less than the wholesale acquisition cost for the prescription
8 drug on the date that the prescription drug is administered or
9 dispensed.
10 b. In addition to the reimbursement under paragraph “a”,
11 an agreement executed by a pharmacy benefits manager and a
12 pharmacy may, at the discretion of the pharmacy, require
