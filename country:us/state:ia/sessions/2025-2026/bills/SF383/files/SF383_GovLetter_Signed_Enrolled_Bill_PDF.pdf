State Capitol Building
LOCAL
Dear Mr. Secretary,
I hereby transmit Senate File 383, an act relating to pharmacy benefits managers, pharmacies,
prescription drugs, and pharmacy services administrative organizations, and including
applicability provisions.
As Governor of this great state, I have worked tirelessly to transform legacy systems of taxation,
regulation, education, healthcare, workforce, and economic development in an effort to provide
lowans with the best possible return on their investment and continue to move this state forward.
After extensive research and thoughtful conversations with employers and stakeholders on all
sides of this complex issue, I made the decision to sign SF 383 in an effort to continue improving
our healthcare system by bringing greater accountability to the role of Pharmacy Benefit
Managers( PBMs). In enacting this bill into law, Iowa joins Texas, Georgia, Indiana and Montana
that this year passed similar legislation to address this important issue along with several other
states that have done so previously, bringing the total to 32 states.
PBMs play a central role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, negotiating drug prices and access
for millions of Americans. Over time, consolidation has led to three major PBMs controlling
80% of the market and a close affiliation with both insurers and pharmacies. This vertical
integration gives them outsized power over which medications patients receive and what they
pay—often resulting in unaffordable drug costs, difficult choices for families, and reimbursement
below pharmacy acquisition cost.
The new bill takes steps toward addressing these challenges by targeting PBM practices that
harm both patients and independent pharmacies. Local pharmacies, especially in rural areas, are
vital to community health and local hospitals but are being driven out by opaque, one-sided
contracts—evidenced by the closure of 34 rural pharmacies in Iowa last year. Additionally, this
legislation amplifies the rural healthcare bill we passed this session and is a meaningful step
toward a fairer, more transparent, and accessible healthcare system for all.
STATE CAPITOL DES MOINES,I OWA 50319 515.281.5211 WWW.GOVERNOR.IOWA.GOV

But this bill does not signify an end. The complexity and lack of verifiable data made signing
this bill a difficult decision, and my administration will closely monitor implementation to
mitigate and ensure that any unintended consequences for private employers are addressed. We
will also be launching a reverse auction to ensure Iowa's state health plan continues to keep costs
as low as possible for the state and its employees.
Sincerely,
Kim Reynolds
