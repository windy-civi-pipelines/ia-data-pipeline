This bill provides for the regulation of a 1 community anaerobic digester system (system) by the department 2 of natural resources (DNR) which must include a digester 3 processing structure that primarily processes manure but may 4 also process other organic feedstocks. The system produces 5 a biogas which is a source of renewable fuel and a digestate 6 which is a nutrient-rich material that may be applied to 7 cropland. 8 TERMINOLOGY. The bill provides for the regulation of 9 off-farm systems. âOn-farmâ refers to real property used to 10 produce agricultural animals or crops as compared to âoff-farmâ 11 which refers to real property other than on-farm. Once 12 manure or feedstock is received by the system, the manure is 13 referred to as digester manure and the feedstock is referred 14 to as digester feedstock. The off-farm system receives 15 on-farm manure and either on-farm or off-farm feedstock. The 16 digester manure or digester feedstock is subject to storage 17 requirements. Different regulations apply to digester 18 feedstock or digester manure that is dry or liquid. Digester 19 manure or digester feedstock is classified as dry only if the 20 digester manure or digester feedstock does not flow perceptibly 21 under pressure, is not capable of being transported through 22 a mechanical pumping device designed to move a liquid, and 23 consists of molecules that do not flow freely among themselves. 24 Generally, liquid digester manure and liquid digester feedstock 25 must be stored in a liquid digester storage structure. Dry 26 digester manure or dry digester feedstock must be stored as 27 a dry digester stockpile or in a liquid digester storage 28 structure. The digester manure or digester feedstock is used 29 by a digester processing structure to produce biogas and a 30 digestate. A digester processing structure must process manure 31 as its primary source. Digestate is also referred to as dry 32 or liquid based on the same criteria used for digester manure 33 and digester feedstock. Liquid digestate is stored in a liquid 34 digestate storage structure and dry digestate is stored as a 35 -33- LSB 2958HV (2) 91 da/ns 33/ 36 H.F. 987 stockpile or in a liquid digestate storage structure. The 1 scope of the bill is limited to the off-farm construction, 2 including expansion, of digester structures on the site of the 3 system, the off-farm stockpiling of dry digester manure or 4 feedstock on the site of the system, the off-farm storage and 5 stockpiling of digestate on the site of the system, the removal 6 of the digestate from the off-farm site of the system, and 7 the on-farm storage and application of the removed digestate. 8 Any reference in the bill to a digester structure means a 9 covered liquid digester storage structure, a covered digester 10 processing structure, or a covered liquid digestate storage 11 structure. Any reference to a digester stockpile refers to a 12 dry digester manure or feedstock stockpile or a dry digestate 13 stockpile. 14 REGULATION. The bill provides that a system cannot be 15 identified with an animal feeding operation where animals are 16 confined and fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any 17 12-month period. Identification occurs only if the system 18 and the animal feeding operation are both (1) under common 19 ownership or management and (2) adjacent. 20 CONSTRUCTION. The bill provides that a construction 21 permit must be issued by DNR prior to the construction 22 of a digester structure. The requirements for a permit 23 are based on permit requirements for the construction of 24 manure storage structures. The application must include an 25 engineering report, construction plans, and specifications 26 prepared by a professional engineer. The bill provides 27 for an application fee not to exceed $1,000. The bill also 28 provides for construction design standards for a formed 29 or unformed digester structure. The construction design 30 standards must be based on uniform standards such as available 31 standards promulgated by ASTM (American society for testing and 32 materials) international. The design standards for unformed 33 digester feedstock storage structures must account for the use 34 of linings and erosion controls. 35 -34- LSB 2958HV (2) 91 da/ns 34/ 36 H.F. 987 SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS ââ AIR QUALITY. The bill 1 provides separation distance requirements as part of air 2 quality and water quality standards. Generally, the separation 3 distance requirements for air quality apply between a digester 4 structure and either a residence not owned by the owner of 5 the system or a designated object or location (commercial 6 enterprise, bona fide religious institution, educational 7 institution, public use area, or public thoroughfare). Other 8 separation distances apply to the stockpiling of dry digester 9 manure or feedstock, or digestate and those same designated 10 objects or locations. The bill also provides separation 11 distance requirements for air quality that apply between 12 the digestate application site and the designated object or 13 location. The separation distance requirements for air quality 14 also provide for certain exceptions, including a waiver by a 15 person benefiting from the separation distance. 16 SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS ââ WATER QUALITY. The 17 bill provides a number of separation distance requirements 18 between a digester structure and certain sources of water, 19 including an agricultural drainage well, known sinkhole, lake, 20 river, reservoir, creek, stream, or ditch. The bill provides 21 separation distance requirements between digestate stockpiles 22 and water sources, with exceptions that apply if measures are 23 taken to reduce runoff. Special restrictions are placed on a 24 stockpile located in karst terrain. The bill restricts the 25 application of digestate on snow covered or frozen ground. 26 DIGESTATE MANAGEMENT. The bill provides that if digestate 27 is applied on land subject to a manure management plan or 28 nutrient management plan, such plan must be attached with 29 a second document referred to as a digestate management 30 supplement. The digestate management supplement must include 31 information necessary to determine the land area required 32 for the application of the digestate and the nutrient 33 concentrations of the digestate. Finally, the bill requires 34 the owner or manager of the system to maintain records 35 -35- LSB 2958HV (2) 91 da/ns 35/ 36 H.F. 987 regarding the systemâs operation. 1 CIVIL PENALTIES. A person who violates an air quality 2 regulation or water quality regulation is subject to a civil 3 penalty based on a schedule established by DNR rule. The 4 civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000 per violation. The civil 5 penalty for a water quality violation may also be subject to 6 a judicial civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each day of 7 such violation. 8 -36- LSB 2958HV (2) 91 da/ns 36/ 36

This bill provides for the regulation of a 1 community anaerobic digester system (system) by the department 2 of natural resources (DNR) which must include a digester 3 processing structure that primarily processes manure but may 4 also process other organic feedstocks. The system produces 5 a biogas which is a source of renewable fuel and a digestate 6 which is a nutrient-rich material that may be applied to 7 cropland. 8 TERMINOLOGY. The bill provides for the regulation of 9 off-farm systems. âOn-farmâ refers to real property used to 10 produce agricultural animals or crops as compared to âoff-farmâ 11 which refers to real property other than on-farm. Once 12 manure or feedstock is received by the system, the manure is 13 referred to as digester manure and the feedstock is referred 14 to as digester feedstock. The off-farm system receives 15 on-farm manure and either on-farm or off-farm feedstock. The 16 digester manure or digester feedstock is subject to storage 17 requirements. Different regulations apply to digester 18 feedstock or digester manure that is dry or liquid. Digester 19 manure or digester feedstock is classified as dry only if the 20 digester manure or digester feedstock does not flow perceptibly 21 under pressure, is not capable of being transported through 22 a mechanical pumping device designed to move a liquid, and 23 consists of molecules that do not flow freely among themselves. 24 Generally, liquid digester manure and liquid digester feedstock 25 must be stored in a liquid digester storage structure. Dry 26 digester manure or dry digester feedstock must be stored as 27 a dry digester stockpile or in a liquid digester storage 28 structure. The digester manure or digester feedstock is used 29 by a digester processing structure to produce biogas and a 30 digestate. A digester processing structure must process manure 31 as its primary source. Digestate is also referred to as dry 32 or liquid based on the same criteria used for digester manure 33 and digester feedstock. Liquid digestate is stored in a liquid 34 digestate storage structure and dry digestate is stored as a 35 -33- LSB 2958HV (2) 91 da/ns 33/ 36 H.F. 987 stockpile or in a liquid digestate storage structure. The 1 scope of the bill is limited to the off-farm construction, 2 including expansion, of digester structures on the site of the 3 system, the off-farm stockpiling of dry digester manure or 4 feedstock on the site of the system, the off-farm storage and 5 stockpiling of digestate on the site of the system, the removal 6 of the digestate from the off-farm site of the system, and 7 the on-farm storage and application of the removed digestate. 8 Any reference in the bill to a digester structure means a 9 covered liquid digester storage structure, a covered digester 10 processing structure, or a covered liquid digestate storage 11 structure. Any reference to a digester stockpile refers to a 12 dry digester manure or feedstock stockpile or a dry digestate 13 stockpile. 14 REGULATION. The bill provides that a system cannot be 15 identified with an animal feeding operation where animals are 16 confined and fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any 17 12-month period. Identification occurs only if the system 18 and the animal feeding operation are both (1) under common 19 ownership or management and (2) adjacent. 20 CONSTRUCTION. The bill provides that a construction 21 permit must be issued by DNR prior to the construction 22 of a digester structure. The requirements for a permit 23 are based on permit requirements for the construction of 24 manure storage structures. The application must include an 25 engineering report, construction plans, and specifications 26 prepared by a professional engineer. The bill provides 27 for an application fee not to exceed $1,000. The bill also 28 provides for construction design standards for a formed 29 or unformed digester structure. The construction design 30 standards must be based on uniform standards such as available 31 standards promulgated by ASTM (American society for testing and 32 materials) international. The design standards for unformed 33 digester feedstock storage structures must account for the use 34 of linings and erosion controls. 35 -34- LSB 2958HV (2) 91 da/ns 34/ 36 H.F. 987 SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS ââ AIR QUALITY. The bill 1 provides separation distance requirements as part of air 2 quality and water quality standards. Generally, the separation 3 distance requirements for air quality apply between a digester 4 structure and either a residence not owned by the owner of 5 the system or a designated object or location (commercial 6 enterprise, bona fide religious institution, educational 7 institution, public use area, or public thoroughfare). Other 8 separation distances apply to the stockpiling of dry digester 9 manure or feedstock, or digestate and those same designated 10 objects or locations. The bill also provides separation 11 distance requirements for air quality that apply between 12 the digestate application site and the designated object or 13 location. The separation distance requirements for air quality 14 also provide for certain exceptions, including a waiver by a 15 person benefiting from the separation distance. 16 SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS ââ WATER QUALITY. The 17 bill provides a number of separation distance requirements 18 between a digester structure and certain sources of water, 19 including an agricultural drainage well, known sinkhole, lake, 20 river, reservoir, creek, stream, or ditch. The bill provides 21 separation distance requirements between digestate stockpiles 22 and water sources, with exceptions that apply if measures are 23 taken to reduce runoff. Special restrictions are placed on a 24 stockpile located in karst terrain. The bill restricts the 25 application of digestate on snow covered or frozen ground. 26 DIGESTATE MANAGEMENT. The bill provides that if digestate 27 is applied on land subject to a manure management plan or 28 nutrient management plan, such plan must be attached with 29 a second document referred to as a digestate management 30 supplement. The digestate management supplement must include 31 information necessary to determine the land area required 32 for the application of the digestate and the nutrient 33 concentrations of the digestate. Finally, the bill requires 34 the owner or manager of the system to maintain records 35 -35- LSB 2958HV (2) 91 da/ns 35/ 36 H.F. 987 regarding the systemâs operation. 1 CIVIL PENALTIES. A person who violates an air quality 2 regulation or water quality regulation is subject to a civil 3 penalty based on a schedule established by DNR rule. The 4 civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000 per violation. The civil 5 penalty for a water quality violation may also be subject to 6 a judicial civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each day of 7 such violation. 8 -36- LSB 2958HV (2) 91 da/ns 36/ 36
