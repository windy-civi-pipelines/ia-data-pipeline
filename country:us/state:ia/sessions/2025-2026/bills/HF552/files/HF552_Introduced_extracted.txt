This subsection is not applicable to a child student 15 who is receiving competent private instruction or independent 16 private instruction in accordance with the requirements of 17 chapter 299A . 18 EXPLANATION 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 20 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 21 This bill relates to compulsory education by modifying 22 provisions related to chronic absenteeism and school engagement 23 meetings. 24 Current law requires the boards of directors of school 25 districts to adopt a policy or rules relating to children who 26 are chronically absent. The bill modifies this provision to 27 provide that the policy or rules relate to students who are 28 chronically absent. Current law establishes that the policy or 29 rules adopted by the boards of directors of school districts 30 must not apply to certain specified children. The bill 31 modifies this provision to provide that the policy or rules 32 must not apply to certain specified students. 33 Current Code section 299.6 provides that any person who 34 violates the compulsory attendance laws commits a public 35 -5- LSB 1578YH (9) 91 jda/jh 5/ 8 H.F. 552 offense. The bill modifies this provision to provide that a 1 person commits a public offense if the person is a parent, 2 guardian, or legal or actual custodian of a child who is of 3 compulsory attendance age, the parent, guardian, or legal or 4 actual custodian has failed to cause the child to attend a 5 public school or an accredited nonpublic school, or to place 6 the child under competent private instruction or independent 7 private instruction in the manner provided in Code chapter 299 8 (compulsory education), and the child is truant. Under Code 9 section 299.6, a first offense is a simple misdemeanor and a 10 conviction is punishable by imprisonment not exceeding 10 days 11 or a fine not exceeding $100. Additionally, the court may 12 order the person to perform not more than 40 hours of unpaid 13 community service instead of any fine or imprisonment. A 14 second offense is a serious misdemeanor and a conviction is 15 punishable by imprisonment not exceeding 20 days or a fine not 16 exceeding $500, or both a fine and imprisonment. The court may 17 order the person to perform unpaid community service instead 18 of any fine or imprisonment. A third or subsequent offense 19 is a serious misdemeanor and a conviction is punishable by 20 imprisonment not exceeding 30 days or a fine not exceeding 21 $1,000, or both a fine and imprisonment. The court may order 22 the person to perform unpaid community service instead of any 23 fine or imprisonment. Current law provides that any person 24 who is referred for prosecution under Code section 299.12 25 (failure to attend) and is convicted of a violation of any of 26 the provisions of Code sections 299.1 through 299.5 commits a 27 public offense. The bill strikes this provision. 28 Current Code section 299.12 provides that when a child 29 becomes âchronically absentâ, a school official is required 30 to send notices to certain interested parties, including the 31 county attorney and either the childâs parent, guardian, legal 32 or actual custodian, or the child, and if the child accumulates 33 additional absences, initiate and participate in a school 34 engagement meeting. The bill provides that, for purposes of 35 -6- LSB 1578YH (9) 91 jda/jh 6/ 8 H.F. 552 Code section 299.12, a student can be considered âchronically 1 absentâ regardless of whether the student is of compulsory 2 attendance age. The bill makes conforming changes. 3 Current law provides that when a child becomes âchronically 4 absentâ under Code section 299.12 (failure to attend), a school 5 official is required to send a notice by certified mail to the 6 childâs parent, guardian, or legal or actual custodian of the 7 child, if the child is not an emancipated minor, or to the 8 child, if the child is an emancipated minor, that includes 9 information related to the childâs absences from school and the 10 policies and disciplinary processes associated with additional 11 absences. The bill modifies this provision to provide that the 12 notice is required to be sent by ordinary mail or electronic 13 mail. 14 Current law provides that if a child is absent from school 15 for greater than or equal to 15 percent of the days or hours 16 in the grading period, a school official shall attempt to find 17 the cause for the childâs absences and shall initiate and 18 participate in a school engagement meeting. The bill requires 19 the school official to send a notice by certified mail to the 20 studentâs parent, guardian, or legal or actual custodian of the 21 student, if the student is not an emancipated minor, or to the 22 student, if the student is an emancipated minor, regarding the 23 school engagement meeting that includes information related 24 to the policies and disciplinary processes associated with 25 additional absences and failing to participate in the school 26 engagement meeting. 27 For purposes of determining whether a student is âabsentâ 28 under Code section 299.12, the bill provides that a studentâs 29 absence that is related to either the exceptions described in 30 the school districtâs policy or rules relating to children 31 who are chronically absent, or to the exceptions set out 32 in Code section 299.2, shall not be considered an absence. 33 Those exceptions apply to any child: who has completed the 34 requirements for graduation in a public school district or has 35 -7- LSB 1578YH (9) 91 jda/jh 7/ 8 H.F. 552 obtained a high school equivalency diploma, who is excused for 1 sufficient reason by any court of record or judge, while the 2 child is attending religious services or receiving religious 3 instructions, who is unable to attend school due to legitimate 4 medical reasons, who has an individualized education program 5 that affects the childâs attendance, who has a plan under 6 section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act that affects the 7 childâs attendance, who is attending an accredited private 8 college preparatory school, who has been excused under Code 9 section 299.22 (deaf or hard of hearing and blind children), 10 or who is exempted under Code section 299.24 (religious groups 11 exempted from school standards). 12 -8- LSB 1578YH (9) 91 jda/jh 8/ 8
