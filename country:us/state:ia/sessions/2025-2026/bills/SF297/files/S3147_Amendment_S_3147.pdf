5 amended to read as follows:
6 3. a. The director shall establish, publish, and enforce
7 rules regulating and restricting the use by the public of the
8 capitol buildings and grounds and of the state laboratories
9 facility in Ankeny, including for events. The rules when
10 established shall be posted in conspicuous places about the
11 capitol buildings and grounds and the state laboratories
12 facility, as applicable. Any person violating any rule, except
13 a parking regulation, shall be guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
14 b. The rules shall prohibit a person, other than a peace
15 officer, from openly carrying a pistol or revolver in the
16 capitol building and on the grounds surrounding the capitol
17 building including state parking lots and parking garages.
18 However, this subsection paragraph shall not be construed
19 to allow the director to prohibit the lawful carrying,
20 transportation, or possession of any pistol or revolver in the
21 capitol building and on the grounds surrounding the capitol
22 building including state parking lots and parking garages by
23 any person regardless of whether the person has a valid permit
24 to carry weapons.
25 c. The rules shall prohibit a person from holding more
26 than six events per calendar year on the grounds outside the
27 capitol building. The rules shall prohibit the person from
28 holding an event unless the director receives a recommendation
29 for the event by a statewide elected official or by both a
30 member of the Iowa senate and a member of the Iowa house of
31 representatives. A request to hold an outdoor event on the
32 capitol complex grounds must be submitted using an application
33 that the department shall provide on the department’s internet
34 site. An applicant may submit the application electronically
35 or in person in a manner prescribed by the department. The

6 by Article I, section 20, of the Constitution of the State of
7 Iowa.

9 occasion, such as a function, meeting, or celebration, that is
