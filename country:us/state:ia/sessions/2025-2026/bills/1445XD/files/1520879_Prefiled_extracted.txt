6 communications network to procure and implement new internet
7 protocol routers for ingress by local exchange providers in a
8 fashion that ensures modernization, redundancy, and resiliency

27 EXPLANATION
28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
29 the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
30 This bill relates to emergency telephone systems by
31 implementing federal rules regarding next generation 911
32 systems and requiring a study on public safety answering
33 points.
34 Under current law, the joint 911 service boards are
35 allocated 60 percent of the funds generated by the emergency
LSB 1445XD (5) 91
-4- sb/js 4/6
S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 communications service surcharge each quarter. The bill
2 decreases this allocation to 46 percent until the completion
3 of phase 1 and phase 2 of the next generation 911 transition
4 as referenced in 47 C.F.R. pt. 9, subpt. J, at which point,
5 the percent of funds generated by the emergency communications
6 service surcharge each quarter allocated by the program manager
7 to joint 911 service boards shall increase to 55 percent.
8 The bill changes the defined term “next generation 911
9 network service provider” to “next generation 911 core
10 service provider” and makes corresponding changes of the term
11 throughout the chapter.
12 Under current law, moneys collected due to the imposition of
13 the emergency communications service surcharge are deposited in
14 the 911 emergency communications fund. Moneys remaining in the
15 911 emergency communications fund after paying all obligations
16 may first be used to provide grants to public safety answering
17 points agreeing to consolidate. The bill eliminates this
18 distribution option.
19 The bill creates transition provisions in order to implement
20 47 C.F.R. pt. 9, subpt. J. In a corresponding order, the
21 federal communications commission stated that the purposes
22 of the regulations are to expedite the transition to next
23 generation 911, to help ensure the nation’s 911 system
24 functions effectively, and to support the deployment of
25 advanced 911 capabilities. The order defines responsibilities
26 and sets deadlines for originating service providers to
27 implement next generation 911 capabilities on their networks
28 and deliver 911 calls to next generation 911 systems.
29 The bill directs the department of homeland security
30 and emergency management (department) to work with the Iowa
31 communications network to procure and implement new internet
32 protocol routers to improve the next generation 911 network.
33 Once the department completes implementation of the new
34 routers, the bill directs the current router provider to
35 decommission the existing routers.

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 The bill directs the department, between the effective
2 date of the bill and June 30, 2026, to begin the process of
3 preparing to fund wireline cost recovery. During that time,
4 joint 911 service boards shall fund wireline cost recovery as
5 applicable. The bill states that wireline cost recovery will
6 be the responsibility of the department from July 1, 2026,
7 until a valid phase 1 request is in place as described in 47
8 C.F.R. pt. 9, subpt. J. The responsibility to fund wireline
9 cost recovery once a valid phase 1 request is in place follows
10 the procedures set forth in 47 C.F.R. pt. 9, subpt. J.
11 The bill directs the department to study multiple topics
12 concerning public safety answering points (PSAPs) and make
13 recommendations to the general assembly by January 1, 2026.
14 The topics include the concept of PSAP managed service where
15 one or more PSAP could enter into an agreement with another
16 PSAP or joint service board for the sharing of management,
17 staffing, policies and procedures, and equipment and systems;
18 when the managed PSAP could operate at less than every hour
19 of every day as needed while calls for the service area
20 are answered by the managing PSAP; funding arrangements and
21 terminology for the managed PSAP and managing PSAP; technical
22 and operational considerations for PSAPs entering into an

7 to joint 911 service boards shall increase to 55 percent.
8 The bill changes the defined term “next generation 911
9 network service provider” to “next generation 911 core
10 service provider” and makes corresponding changes of the term
11 throughout the chapter.
12 Under current law, moneys collected due to the imposition of
13 the emergency communications service surcharge are deposited in
14 the 911 emergency communications fund. Moneys remaining in the
15 911 emergency communications fund after paying all obligations
16 may first be used to provide grants to public safety answering
17 points agreeing to consolidate. The bill eliminates this
18 distribution option.
19 The bill creates transition provisions in order to implement
20 47 C.F.R. pt. 9, subpt. J. In a corresponding order, the
21 federal communications commission stated that the purposes
22 of the regulations are to expedite the transition to next
23 generation 911, to help ensure the nation’s 911 system
24 functions effectively, and to support the deployment of
25 advanced 911 capabilities. The order defines responsibilities
26 and sets deadlines for originating service providers to
27 implement next generation 911 capabilities on their networks
28 and deliver 911 calls to next generation 911 systems.
29 The bill directs the department of homeland security
30 and emergency management (department) to work with the Iowa
31 communications network to procure and implement new internet
32 protocol routers to improve the next generation 911 network.
33 Once the department completes implementation of the new
34 routers, the bill directs the current router provider to
35 decommission the existing routers.

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 The bill directs the department, between the effective
2 date of the bill and June 30, 2026, to begin the process of
3 preparing to fund wireline cost recovery. During that time,
4 joint 911 service boards shall fund wireline cost recovery as
5 applicable. The bill states that wireline cost recovery will
6 be the responsibility of the department from July 1, 2026,
7 until a valid phase 1 request is in place as described in 47
8 C.F.R. pt. 9, subpt. J. The responsibility to fund wireline
9 cost recovery once a valid phase 1 request is in place follows
10 the procedures set forth in 47 C.F.R. pt. 9, subpt. J.
11 The bill directs the department to study multiple topics
12 concerning public safety answering points (PSAPs) and make
13 recommendations to the general assembly by January 1, 2026.
14 The topics include the concept of PSAP managed service where
15 one or more PSAP could enter into an agreement with another
16 PSAP or joint service board for the sharing of management,
17 staffing, policies and procedures, and equipment and systems;
18 when the managed PSAP could operate at less than every hour
19 of every day as needed while calls for the service area
20 are answered by the managing PSAP; funding arrangements and
21 terminology for the managed PSAP and managing PSAP; technical
22 and operational considerations for PSAPs entering into an
23 agreement; and points where consolidation of systems and
24 equipment are feasible.
