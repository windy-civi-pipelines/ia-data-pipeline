This bill provides for the administration of a 16 number of programs and regulations relating to agriculture, 17 including crop production, and specifically the application of 18 soil inputs such as fertilizers and soil conditioners (Code 19 chapters 200 and 200A) and pesticides (Code chapter 206); 20 animal health, and specifically the control of infectious or 21 contagious diseases afflicting animals (Code chapter 163), the 22 practice of veterinary medicine (Code chapter 169), and the 23 court-ordered management of livestock in immediate need of 24 sustenance (Code chapter 717); and agricultural processing, and 25 specifically the slaughter and processing of meat and poultry 26 products (Code chapter 189A). 27 CROP PRODUCTION ââ APPLICATION OF NUTRIENTS ââ BACKGROUND. 28 The department of agriculture and land stewardship (DALS) 29 regulates the composition of soil inputs, including nutrients 30 such as fertilizers which are manufactured to achieve optimum 31 plant growth under the Iowa fertilizer law (Code section 32 200.1), which includes a number of definitions (Code section 33 200.3). DALS also regulates fertilizing material which is 34 a substance used to compound a fertilizer, and a commercial 35 -32- LSB 2803XC (2) 91 da/ns 32/ 37 S.F. _____ fertilizer which refers to a fertilizer, fertilizing material, 1 and a fertilizer-pesticide mixture. A secondary input is 2 referred to as a soil conditioner which is a substance other 3 than a fertilizer that improves the condition or structure 4 of the soil and is also used to improve plant growth. DALS 5 licenses persons who manufacture, offer for sale, sell, or 6 distribute a fertilizer or soil conditioner. The person is 7 also subject to a license fee (Code section 200.4). Each brand 8 or grade of commercial fertilizer or soil conditioner must 9 be registered with DALS (Code section 200.5). A fertilizer 10 or soil conditioner is subject to label requirements (Code 11 section 200.6). DALS imposes an inspection fee upon a 12 licensee (Code section 200.8). DALS must sample, inspect, 13 make analysis of, and test a commercial fertilizer or soil 14 conditioner distributed within the state (Code section 200.10). 15 A person is prohibited from manufacturing, offering for sale, 16 or selling a commercial fertilizer or soil conditioner that 17 is injurious to crop growth or deleterious to the soil (Code 18 section 200.11). A person selling a commercial fertilizer 19 or soil conditioner must identify substances promoting 20 its use in a manner that is not deceptive (Code section 21 200.12). DALS must adopt rules regulating equipment used 22 in storing, handling, and transporting fertilizers and soil 23 conditioners (Code section 200.14). DALS is authorized to 24 take administrative action against a licensee or registrant 25 acting in violation of the law, including by canceling the 26 license or registration (Code section 200.15), issuing a stop 27 order (Code section 200.16), or seizing a commercial fertilizer 28 or soil conditioner (Code section 200.17). A county, city, 29 or other political subdivision is prohibited from passing or 30 enforcing local legislation that regulates the use, sale, 31 distribution, storage, transportation, disposal, formulation, 32 labeling, registration, or manufacture of a fertilizer or soil 33 conditioner (Code section 200.22). A person registering a 34 pesticide must account for formulations of a fertilizer (Code 35 -33- LSB 2803XC (2) 91 da/ns 33/ 37 S.F. _____ section 206.12). A number of Code sections include a reference 1 to soil conditioners: the definition of agricultural land 2 for purposes of eminent domain (Code section 6A.21) and urban 3 renewal (Code section 403.17) each include such a reference. 4 A transportation regulation involving hazardous materials 5 includes soil conditioners (Code section 321.1). A commodity 6 production contract lien (Code section 579B.1) covers the use 7 of a soil conditioner. An exception to the criminal offense 8 of critical infrastructure sabotage includes the use of a soil 9 conditioner (Code section 716.11). 10 CROP PRODUCTION ââ APPLICATION OF NUTRIENTS ââ BILL. The 11 bill replaces the term soil conditioner with beneficial 12 substance which is defined as a substance or compound that is 13 beneficial to one or more species of plants, soil, or media. 14 It includes a plant amendment, plant biostimulant, plant 15 inoculant, soil-amending ingredient, soil-amending form, soil 16 amendment, and soil inoculant. The bill changes references to 17 the state chemist to the bureau chief of the Iowa laboratory 18 bureau (Code sections 190C.22 and 200.10). 19 APPLICATION OF PESTICIDES ââ CERTIFICATION ââ BACKGROUND. 20 DALS is responsible for the administration and enforcement of 21 the âPesticide Act of Iowaâ (Code chapter 206), which in part 22 regulates the use of a pesticide by a commercial applicator, 23 public applicator, or private applicator (Code section 206.2). 24 Generally, a person acting as a commercial applicator or public 25 applicator must be certified to apply any pesticide, and a 26 person acting as a commercial applicator, public applicator, 27 or private applicator (e.g., a farmer) must be certified to 28 apply a restricted use pesticide (Code section 206.5). The 29 designation ârestricted useâ is determined by DALS (Code 30 section 206.20) and is generally based on a pesticide so 31 classified by the United States environmental protection agency 32 (40 C.F.R. Â§152.160 et seq.). DALS is required to administer 33 an educational program in cooperation with the Iowa cooperative 34 extension service in agriculture and home economics of Iowa 35 -34- LSB 2803XC (2) 91 da/ns 34/ 37 S.F. _____ state university of science and technology. In order to be 1 certified, a person must participate in the educational program 2 by passing an examination for an initial certification and pass 3 an examination or attend instructional hours every three years 4 for the renewal of the certification (Code section 206.5). 5 APPLICATION OF PESTICIDES ââ CERTIFICATION ââ BILL. The 6 bill removes a requirement that DALS adopt by rule criteria 7 allowing a person required to be certified to complete either a 8 written or oral examination. The bill provides that DALS has 9 discretion to adopt such rules. 10 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS OR CONTAGIOUS 11 DISEASES AFFLICTING ANIMALS ââ BACKGROUND. DALS is granted 12 authority to provide for the health of animals and specifically 13 the control of an infectious or contagious disease (disease) 14 afflicting livestock populations (Code chapter 163). The term 15 âcontrolâ refers to prevention, suppression, or eradication 16 efforts (Code section 163.2). 17 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS OR CONTAGIOUS 18 DISEASES AFFLICTING ANIMALS ââ BILL. The bill provides that 19 DALS may determine and employ the most efficient and practical 20 means to identify and control a possible, imminent, or actual 21 threat to an animal population caused by a disease. 22 The bill provides that DALS may adopt any necessary rules 23 for the control of an infectious disease affecting animals 24 within the state by emergency rulemaking. When a statute 25 authorizes emergency rulemaking, an agency may adopt a rule 26 immediately without going through the periods of the rulemaking 27 process known as regulatory analysis (Code section 17A.4A) 28 and notice of intended action (Code section 17A.4(3)). The 29 bill requires that such emergency rulemaking be âdouble 30 barreledâ. Under the process known as double-barreled 31 rulemaking, when an agency files an emergency rule, it also 32 files the same rule as a notice of intended action that will 33 follow the regular rulemaking process. Normally, a rule 34 cannot be effective prior to 35 days after its filing with the 35 -35- LSB 2803XC (2) 91 da/ns 35/ 37 S.F. _____ administrative rules coordinator and publication in the Iowa 1 administrative bulletin. Under emergency rulemaking, a rule 2 can be made effective on the date of filing and acceptance 3 by the administrative rules coordinator or any subsequent 4 date, as specified by the agency in the filing (Code section 5 17A.5(2)(b)(1)). 6 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ PRACTICE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE ââ 7 BACKGROUND. Veterinarians are regulated by the board of 8 veterinary medicine (veterinary board) which is responsible 9 for licensing and imposing disciplinary action, including the 10 suspension or revocation of a license for cause following a 11 notice and hearing before the veterinary board. The basis for 12 disciplinary action includes making a false representation, 13 being convicted of a felony in Iowa or another jurisdiction, 14 violating a statute or law of Iowa or another jurisdiction, 15 being subject to disciplinary action in another state, 16 assisting in the unlawful practice of veterinary medicine, 17 being adjudged as mentally incompetent, failing to conform 18 with an acceptable practice of veterinary medicine, and being 19 unable to practice veterinary medicine with reasonable skill 20 and safety (amended Code section 169.13). 21 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ PRACTICE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE ââ BILL. 22 The bill provides that, in addition to imposing disciplinary 23 action, the veterinary board may assess a civil penalty. 24 The amount of the civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000 per 25 violation. The attorney general may initiate a claim to 26 collect a civil penalty and any amount collected must be 27 deposited in the general fund of the state. 28 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ COURT-ORDERED MANAGEMENT OF LIVESTOCK 29 IN IMMEDIATE NEED OF SUSTENANCE ââ BACKGROUND. DALS is 30 granted the authority to petition a court to conduct a hearing 31 regarding the condition of livestock. If the court determines 32 that the livestock are in immediate need of sustenance, it 33 must issue an order directing DALS to assume supervision of 34 the livestock (Code section 717.3). The order creates a 35 -36- LSB 2803XC (2) 91 da/ns 36/ 37 S.F. _____ super-priority lien attached to the livestock, proceeds from 1 the sale of livestock, and any associated unmanufactured 2 products, for the benefit of DALS. DALS may also petition 3 a court to order the disposition of the specified livestock. 4 The proceeds from the sale of the livestock are to be used to 5 reimburse DALS according to the lienâs super-priority status. 6 DALS may also utilize moneys deposited in the livestock 7 remediation fund (remediation fund) (Code section 459.501) 8 to pay for costs of providing for sustenance to livestock as 9 provided in the court order (Code section 717.4A). 10 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ COURT-ORDERED MANAGEMENT OF LIVESTOCK 11 IN IMMEDIATE NEED OF SUSTENANCE ââ BILL. The bill rewrites 12 a provision requiring DALS to repay the remediation fund 13 any proceeds that DALS receives from the disposition of the 14 livestock less expenses in providing for the sustenance and 15 disposition. The bill provides that if the court orders the 16 disposition of the livestock, the order shall be deemed as 17 acting in response to a petition by a receiver appointed by a 18 court in Code chapter 680. 19 AGRICULTURAL PROCESSING ââ SLAUGHTER AND PROCESSING OF MEAT 20 AND POULTRY PRODUCTS ââ LICENSURE ââ BILL. The bill provides 21 that a home food processing establishment licensed by the 22 department of inspections, appeals, and licensing is exempt 23 from DALS licensing requirements (Code chapter 137D). A home 24 food processing establishment refers to a residence in which 25 homemade food items are produced for sale, if consumption is 26 off premises and its business has gross annual sales of less 27 than $50,000 (Code section 137D.1). The bill also provides 28 that the term of a license issued by DALS to a slaughter and 29 processing establishment is extended to a two-year period (from 30 July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2027). The licensee fee is doubled 31 from $25 to $50 and from $50 to $100 to reflect the licenseâs 32 biennial term. DALS is required to prorate the license fee 33 for a new establishment. The bill makes various changes in 34 terminology to improve readability. 35 -37- LSB 2803XC (2) 91 da/ns 37/ 37

This bill provides for the administration of a 16 number of programs and regulations relating to agriculture, 17 including crop production, and specifically the application of 18 soil inputs such as fertilizers and soil conditioners (Code 19 chapters 200 and 200A) and pesticides (Code chapter 206); 20 animal health, and specifically the control of infectious or 21 contagious diseases afflicting animals (Code chapter 163), the 22 practice of veterinary medicine (Code chapter 169), and the 23 court-ordered management of livestock in immediate need of 24 sustenance (Code chapter 717); and agricultural processing, and 25 specifically the slaughter and processing of meat and poultry 26 products (Code chapter 189A). 27 CROP PRODUCTION ââ APPLICATION OF NUTRIENTS ââ BACKGROUND. 28 The department of agriculture and land stewardship (DALS) 29 regulates the composition of soil inputs, including nutrients 30 such as fertilizers which are manufactured to achieve optimum 31 plant growth under the Iowa fertilizer law (Code section 32 200.1), which includes a number of definitions (Code section 33 200.3). DALS also regulates fertilizing material which is 34 a substance used to compound a fertilizer, and a commercial 35 -32- LSB 2803XC (2) 91 da/ns 32/ 37 S.F. _____ fertilizer which refers to a fertilizer, fertilizing material, 1 and a fertilizer-pesticide mixture. A secondary input is 2 referred to as a soil conditioner which is a substance other 3 than a fertilizer that improves the condition or structure 4 of the soil and is also used to improve plant growth. DALS 5 licenses persons who manufacture, offer for sale, sell, or 6 distribute a fertilizer or soil conditioner. The person is 7 also subject to a license fee (Code section 200.4). Each brand 8 or grade of commercial fertilizer or soil conditioner must 9 be registered with DALS (Code section 200.5). A fertilizer 10 or soil conditioner is subject to label requirements (Code 11 section 200.6). DALS imposes an inspection fee upon a 12 licensee (Code section 200.8). DALS must sample, inspect, 13 make analysis of, and test a commercial fertilizer or soil 14 conditioner distributed within the state (Code section 200.10). 15 A person is prohibited from manufacturing, offering for sale, 16 or selling a commercial fertilizer or soil conditioner that 17 is injurious to crop growth or deleterious to the soil (Code 18 section 200.11). A person selling a commercial fertilizer 19 or soil conditioner must identify substances promoting 20 its use in a manner that is not deceptive (Code section 21 200.12). DALS must adopt rules regulating equipment used 22 in storing, handling, and transporting fertilizers and soil 23 conditioners (Code section 200.14). DALS is authorized to 24 take administrative action against a licensee or registrant 25 acting in violation of the law, including by canceling the 26 license or registration (Code section 200.15), issuing a stop 27 order (Code section 200.16), or seizing a commercial fertilizer 28 or soil conditioner (Code section 200.17). A county, city, 29 or other political subdivision is prohibited from passing or 30 enforcing local legislation that regulates the use, sale, 31 distribution, storage, transportation, disposal, formulation, 32 labeling, registration, or manufacture of a fertilizer or soil 33 conditioner (Code section 200.22). A person registering a 34 pesticide must account for formulations of a fertilizer (Code 35 -33- LSB 2803XC (2) 91 da/ns 33/ 37 S.F. _____ section 206.12). A number of Code sections include a reference 1 to soil conditioners: the definition of agricultural land 2 for purposes of eminent domain (Code section 6A.21) and urban 3 renewal (Code section 403.17) each include such a reference. 4 A transportation regulation involving hazardous materials 5 includes soil conditioners (Code section 321.1). A commodity 6 production contract lien (Code section 579B.1) covers the use 7 of a soil conditioner. An exception to the criminal offense 8 of critical infrastructure sabotage includes the use of a soil 9 conditioner (Code section 716.11). 10 CROP PRODUCTION ââ APPLICATION OF NUTRIENTS ââ BILL. The 11 bill replaces the term soil conditioner with beneficial 12 substance which is defined as a substance or compound that is 13 beneficial to one or more species of plants, soil, or media. 14 It includes a plant amendment, plant biostimulant, plant 15 inoculant, soil-amending ingredient, soil-amending form, soil 16 amendment, and soil inoculant. The bill changes references to 17 the state chemist to the bureau chief of the Iowa laboratory 18 bureau (Code sections 190C.22 and 200.10). 19 APPLICATION OF PESTICIDES ââ CERTIFICATION ââ BACKGROUND. 20 DALS is responsible for the administration and enforcement of 21 the âPesticide Act of Iowaâ (Code chapter 206), which in part 22 regulates the use of a pesticide by a commercial applicator, 23 public applicator, or private applicator (Code section 206.2). 24 Generally, a person acting as a commercial applicator or public 25 applicator must be certified to apply any pesticide, and a 26 person acting as a commercial applicator, public applicator, 27 or private applicator (e.g., a farmer) must be certified to 28 apply a restricted use pesticide (Code section 206.5). The 29 designation ârestricted useâ is determined by DALS (Code 30 section 206.20) and is generally based on a pesticide so 31 classified by the United States environmental protection agency 32 (40 C.F.R. Â§152.160 et seq.). DALS is required to administer 33 an educational program in cooperation with the Iowa cooperative 34 extension service in agriculture and home economics of Iowa 35 -34- LSB 2803XC (2) 91 da/ns 34/ 37 S.F. _____ state university of science and technology. In order to be 1 certified, a person must participate in the educational program 2 by passing an examination for an initial certification and pass 3 an examination or attend instructional hours every three years 4 for the renewal of the certification (Code section 206.5). 5 APPLICATION OF PESTICIDES ââ CERTIFICATION ââ BILL. The 6 bill removes a requirement that DALS adopt by rule criteria 7 allowing a person required to be certified to complete either a 8 written or oral examination. The bill provides that DALS has 9 discretion to adopt such rules. 10 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS OR CONTAGIOUS 11 DISEASES AFFLICTING ANIMALS ââ BACKGROUND. DALS is granted 12 authority to provide for the health of animals and specifically 13 the control of an infectious or contagious disease (disease) 14 afflicting livestock populations (Code chapter 163). The term 15 âcontrolâ refers to prevention, suppression, or eradication 16 efforts (Code section 163.2). 17 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS OR CONTAGIOUS 18 DISEASES AFFLICTING ANIMALS ââ BILL. The bill provides that 19 DALS may determine and employ the most efficient and practical 20 means to identify and control a possible, imminent, or actual 21 threat to an animal population caused by a disease. 22 The bill provides that DALS may adopt any necessary rules 23 for the control of an infectious disease affecting animals 24 within the state by emergency rulemaking. When a statute 25 authorizes emergency rulemaking, an agency may adopt a rule 26 immediately without going through the periods of the rulemaking 27 process known as regulatory analysis (Code section 17A.4A) 28 and notice of intended action (Code section 17A.4(3)). The 29 bill requires that such emergency rulemaking be âdouble 30 barreledâ. Under the process known as double-barreled 31 rulemaking, when an agency files an emergency rule, it also 32 files the same rule as a notice of intended action that will 33 follow the regular rulemaking process.
