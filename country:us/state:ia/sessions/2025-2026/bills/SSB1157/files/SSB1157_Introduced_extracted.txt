Under current law, 21 the tax rate imposed on sports wagering net receipts of a 22 licensed operator is 6.75 percent, which is deposited in the 23 sports wagering receipts fund. The bill increases the rate to 24 9 percent. For FY 2026-2027 and each fiscal year thereafter, 25 the bill appropriates $8 million from the sports wagering 26 receipts fund to the public safety equipment fund, which is 27 used by the department of public safety (DPS) for purchase, 28 maintenance, and replacement of equipment. The bill exempts 29 the appropriated moneys from the sports wagering receipts 30 fund reporting requirements under current law, as current law 31 already requires DPS to report on the use of moneys in the 32 public safety equipment fund. 33 Under current law, to determine the license fees and 34 regulatory fees to be charged in accordance with Code sections 35 -11- LSB 1774XC (5) 91 ll/ns 11/ 15 S.F. _____ 99D.14 and 99F.10, the state racing and gaming commission 1 (commission) must use the amount appropriated to the commission 2 plus the gaming enforcement costs of DPSâs division of criminal 3 investigation.

The rate is 5 percent on the first $1 million 22 and 10 percent on the next $2 million. Over $3 million, the tax 23 rate is 22 percent for an excursion gambling boat or gambling 24 structure, and between 22 and 24 percent for a racetrack 25 enclosure based on the existence of an excursion gambling boat 26 or gambling structure in the same county, whether the racetrack 27 enclosure has been issued a table games license, and whether 28 adjusted gross receipts reached $100 million. 29 The bill eliminates this tax rate structure and imposes a 30 tax of 22 percent for an excursion gambling boat or gambling 31 structure, and 24.125 percent for a racetrack enclosure, on all 32 adjusted gross receipts each fiscal year. 33 For FY 2026-2027 and each fiscal year thereafter, prior 34 to the remaining amount of the adjusted gross receipts tax 35 -12- LSB 1774XC (5) 91 ll/ns 12/ 15 S.F. _____ being credited to the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund as 1 provided under current law, an amount is credited to the gaming 2 enforcement revolving fund up to the amount appropriated by the 3 general assembly to DPS for gaming enforcement from that fund 4 for that fiscal year. 5 This division of the bill takes effect January 1, 2026. 6 IOWA MAJOR EVENTS AND TOURISM PROGRAM AND FUND.

Under current law, 21 the tax rate imposed on sports wagering net receipts of a 22 licensed operator is 6.75 percent, which is deposited in the 23 sports wagering receipts fund. The bill increases the rate to 24 9 percent. For FY 2026-2027 and each fiscal year thereafter, 25 the bill appropriates $8 million from the sports wagering 26 receipts fund to the public safety equipment fund, which is 27 used by the department of public safety (DPS) for purchase, 28 maintenance, and replacement of equipment.

Over $3 million, the tax 23 rate is 22 percent for an excursion gambling boat or gambling 24 structure, and between 22 and 24 percent for a racetrack 25 enclosure based on the existence of an excursion gambling boat 26 or gambling structure in the same county, whether the racetrack 27 enclosure has been issued a table games license, and whether 28 adjusted gross receipts reached $100 million. 29 The bill eliminates this tax rate structure and imposes a 30 tax of 22 percent for an excursion gambling boat or gambling 31 structure, and 24.125 percent for a racetrack enclosure, on all 32 adjusted gross receipts each fiscal year. 33 For FY 2026-2027 and each fiscal year thereafter, prior 34 to the remaining amount of the adjusted gross receipts tax 35 -12- LSB 1774XC (5) 91 ll/ns 12/ 15 S.F. _____ being credited to the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund as 1 provided under current law, an amount is credited to the gaming 2 enforcement revolving fund up to the amount appropriated by the 3 general assembly to DPS for gaming enforcement from that fund 4 for that fiscal year. 5 This division of the bill takes effect January 1, 2026. 6 IOWA MAJOR EVENTS AND TOURISM PROGRAM AND FUND.
