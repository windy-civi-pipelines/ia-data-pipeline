Current law authorizes 27 the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of a child of 28 compulsory attendance age to place the child under competent 29 private instruction or independent private instruction. 30 Current law requires a childâs parent, guardian, or legal 31 custodian who is placing the child under competent private 32 instruction for the first time to provide the childâs school 33 district of residence with evidence that the child has had the 34 immunizations required under Code section 139A.8 (immunization 35 -5- LSB 1502XS (3) 91 jda/jh 5/ 8 S.F. 204 of children), and, if the child is elementary school age, a 1 blood lead test.

This 9 provision takes effect upon enactment and applies to any 10 diplomas or credentials issued before, on, or after the new 11 Code sectionâs effective date. 12 The bill prohibits the state, a political subdivision of the 13 state, a community college, institutions of higher education 14 under the control of the state board of regents, or an 15 accredited private institution from discriminating against any 16 individual based on the source of the individualâs diploma or 17 credential and shall treat a diploma or credential awarded for 18 completion of a program of secondary education under competent 19 private instruction or independent private instruction the 20 same as a high school diploma awarded by a school district or 21 accredited nonpublic school. This provision takes effect upon 22 enactment and applies to any diplomas or credentials issued 23 before, on, or after the new Code sectionâs effective date. 24 The bill provides that the parent, guardian, or legal 25 custodian of a child of compulsory attendance age shall 26 have the authority to execute any document required by law 27 to verify the placement of a child under competent private 28 instruction or independent private instruction, the childâs 29 full-time or part-time status in competent private instruction 30 or independent private instruction, the grades the child has 31 obtained in competent private instruction or independent 32 private instruction, or any other required educational 33 information. 34 DIVISION II ââ WORLD LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION. The bill 35 -7- LSB 1502XS (3) 91 jda/jh 7/ 8 S.F. 204 modifies provisions related to world language instruction in 1 grades 9 through 12 in school districts, accredited nonpublic 2 schools, charter schools, and innovation zone schools by 3 prohibiting the incorporation of gender-neutral language when 4 the world language being taught utilizes a grammatical gender 5 system. 6 DIVISION III ââ TUITION AND TEXTBOOK TAX CREDIT. Current law 7 establishes a tuition credit equal to 25 percent of the first 8 $2,000 which the taxpayer has paid to others for each dependent 9 in grades kindergarten through 12, for tuition and textbooks 10 of each dependent who is receiving private instruction or who 11 is attending an elementary or secondary school situated in 12 Iowa, which school is accredited or approved under Code section 13 256.11, which is not operated for profit, and which adheres 14 to the provisions of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 15 Code chapter 216 (Iowa civil rights Act of 1965). The bill 16 increases the amount of this tax credit to 50 percent of the 17 first $2,000. The division applies retroactively to January 1, 18 2025, for tax years beginning on or after that date. 19 -8- LSB 1502XS (3) 91 jda/jh 8/ 8
