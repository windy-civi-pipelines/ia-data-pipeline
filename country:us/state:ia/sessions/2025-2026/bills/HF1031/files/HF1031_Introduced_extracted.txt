The bill requires the Iowa county recorders 16 association to issue a request for proposals in 2030, and 17 every five years thereafter, to select a vendor to provide a 18 statewide search website for the purpose of viewing county 19 public land records. The bill requires each county to upload 20 data and images of recorded documents to the statewide search 21 website. The bill makes conforming changes throughout Code 22 chapter 331, subchapter V, part 3, to remove or replace 23 references to the county land record information system and its 24 governing board. 25 The bill strikes a provision requiring the county recorder 26 to collect a fee of $1 for each transaction for which a fee 27 is paid to be used exclusively for the purpose of preserving 28 and maintaining public records. Currently, that fee is 29 deposited in a countyâs county recorderâs record management 30 fund and used to produce and maintain public records that 31 meet archival standards, and to enhance the technological 32 storage, retrieval, and transmission capabilities related to 33 archival quality records, in addition to other enumerated 34 purposes. Additionally, the recorder may cooperate with other 35 -22- LSB 1758HV (2) 91 js/jh 22/ 24 H.F. 1031 entities, boards, and agencies to establish methods of records 1 management, and participate in other joint ventures that 2 further the purposes of the fund.

Of 11 the total fee collected, the bill requires $2 to be deposited 12 in a countyâs recorderâs technology advancement fund. The bill 13 authorizes the recorder to collaborate with other entities, 14 boards, and agencies to advance the use of technology for the 15 delivery of services consistent with standards established for 16 those services. The bill enumerates purposes for which moneys 17 in a countyâs recorderâs technology advancement fund shall be 18 used. 19 The bill requires a county bound by the chapter 28E agreement 20 with the electronic services system to transfer from the total 21 fee collected for the recording of a document in that county $3 22 to be deposited in the countyâs recorderâs electronic services 23 system fund, created pursuant to the bill, which moneys 24 shall be transferred monthly to an account in a financial 25 institution designated by the electronic services system and 26 used for purposes described in the bill. A county recorder in 27 a county not participating in the chapter 28E agreement with 28 the electronic services system shall transfer from the total 29 fee collected for the recording of a document in that county 30 $1 to be deposited in the countyâs county recorder electronic 31 transaction fund, which each county treasurer shall establish 32 pursuant to current law. The bill requires moneys in the 33 countyâs county recorder electronic transaction fund to be 34 used for preserving and maintaining a statewide public record 35 -23- LSB 1758HV (2) 91 js/jh 23/ 24 H.F. 1031 search. 1 The bill eliminates the local government electronic 2 transaction fund in the office of the treasurer of state 3 under the control of the treasurer of state. Under current 4 law, moneys in the local government electronic transaction 5 fund are used for the payment of claims approved by the 6 governing board of the county land record information system, 7 including planning and implementing electronic recording and 8 electronic transactions in each county, developing county 9 and statewide internet sites to provide electronic access 10 to records and information, and paying the ongoing costs of 11 integrating and maintaining the statewide internet site. The 12 bill appropriates moneys remaining in the local government 13 electronic transaction fund on the effective date of the bill 14 to the treasurer of state to be used by the treasurer of state 15 to assist the governing board of the electronic services system 16 in developing, operating, and maintaining a county land record 17 information system. 18 The bill amends provisions relating to the access of certain 19 personally identifiable information, including by outlining 20 procedures for shielding information, defining persons 21 qualified to have their information shielded, and defining 22 persons authorized to access such information and under what 23 circumstances. 24 The bill amends provisions of Code chapter 331, subchapter 25 V, part 3, regarding the formatting of documents and surveys 26 submitted for filing or recording and makes other conforming 27 changes. 28 -24- LSB 1758HV (2) 91 js/jh 24/ 24
