For Code chapter 648, 29 this also applies to delivery to a resident of the premises 30 that is at least 18 years old. 31 The bill allows service of notice by mail in a forcible 32 entry and detainer case to occur prior to the two attempts of 33 personal service and delivery evidenced by an acknowledgment 34 of service. 35 -7- LSB 2581HV (1) 91 cm/jh 7/ 9 H.F. 983 The bill provides that 90 daysâ peaceable possession with 1 the knowledge of the plaintiff after the cause of action 2 accrues is a bar to a forcible entry and detainer proceeding. 3 This is a change from 30 days in current law. 4 The bill provides that in a forcible entry and detainer 5 action, any personal property of the defendant remaining after 6 removal from the premises may be disposed of by the plaintiff. 7 This does not include a mobile home or its contents unless the 8 mobile home is the premises. 9 The bill provides that the defendantâs personal property 10 remaining on the premises after the defendantâs removal may be 11 disposed of by the plaintiff. 12 The bill requires a court to seal the court records of an 13 eviction action not later than three days from the date of the 14 order if any of the following have occurred: the defendant is 15 found not guilty, the case is dismissed, the plaintiff does not 16 appear for the hearing, or if, by motion or upon the courtâs 17 own determination, the court finds there is no genuine issue of 18 material fact between the parties. 19 The bill provides that upon application of a defendant found 20 guilty in an eviction action for nonpayment of rent, the court 21 shall seal the court records if more than seven years have 22 passed since disposition, the applicant has not been found 23 guilty in a subsequent eviction action in the five-year period 24 preceding the application, the applicant within the last 10 25 years has not been granted a sealing of eviction court records, 26 and the applicant has paid all costs. The application to seal 27 shall be included in the sealed court records. 28 The bill requires the court in an eviction action for 29 nonpayment of rent in which the defendant is found guilty to 30 enter an order sealing the court records if the application to 31 seal is filed jointly by the plaintiff and defendant and the 32 defendant has paid all court costs, fees, fines, and any other 33 fees ordered by the court or clerk of the district court in the 34 case. 35 -8- LSB 2581HV (1) 91 cm/jh 8/ 9 H.F. 983 The bill provides that upon sealing the court records, all 1 filings, documentation, and writs of association shall be 2 removed from any publicly accessible location. Sealed court 3 records shall not be available for public inspection except 4 upon request by the defendant or the attorney for the defendant 5 by filing a motion in the sealed case or application to the 6 judicial branch using a form to be prescribed by the supreme 7 court for scholarly, educational, journalistic, or governmental 8 purposes. The bill requires the state court administrator 9 to maintain a record in the aggregate of all filings and to 10 make such information available to the public in such a manner 11 prescribed by the supreme court as to protect the identity of 12 the parties while still providing the public with information 13 relating to eviction actions. 14 Under the bill, certain provisions do not apply to an 15 application to seal a record for an eviction action by a 16 defendant found guilty when a money judgment has been awarded 17 to the plaintiff. 18 Certain provisions of the bill relating to an application to 19 seal do not create an independent cause of action by a tenant 20 for use of lawfully obtained information. 21 The provisions of the bill relating to the sealing of court 22 records take effect July 1, 2026. 23 -9- LSB 2581HV (1) 91 cm/jh 9/ 9

The following takes effect July 31 1, 2026: 32 The section of this Act amending section 648.22. 33 EXPLANATION 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 35 -6- LSB 2581HV (1) 91 cm/jh 6/ 9 H.F. 983 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 1 This bill relates to property law. 2 The bill defines the term ârentâ for purposes of Code chapter 3 562A (uniform residential landlord and tenant law) to include 4 base rent, utilities, late fees, and other payments made by 5 the tenant to the landlord under the rental agreement. The 6 general assembly made an identical change to the term ârentâ in 7 Code chapter 562B (manufactured home communities or mobile home 8 parks residential landlord and tenant law) in 2022. 9 The bill provides that in computing time for completion of 10 service under Code chapters 562A and 562B, the first day shall 11 be excluded and the final day shall be included regardless of 12 whether it is a weekend or federal holiday. 13 Under current law, a landlord (Code chapter 562A) or a 14 landlord or tenant (Code chapter 562B) is prohibited from 15 willfully (Code chapter 562A) or knowingly (Code chapter 16 562B) using a rental agreement containing provisions that are 17 prohibited by current law. The bill alters these provisions to 18 instead prohibit enforcing a provision of a rental agreement 19 that is prohibited by current law. The bill allows a landlord 20 access to a mobile home owned by a tenant, after entry of an 21 order of removal of the tenant, to secure the mobile home or 22 mobile home space. 23 The bill provides that for Code chapters 562A, 562B, and 648 24 (forcible entry and detainer), notices delivered by posting on 25 the primary entrance door and mailing to the premises that are 26 addressed to all tenants and unknown parties in possession are 27 deemed to have provided notice to all tenants, occupants, and 28 parties in possession of the premises. For Code chapter 648, 29 this also applies to delivery to a resident of the premises 30 that is at least 18 years old. 31 The bill allows service of notice by mail in a forcible 32 entry and detainer case to occur prior to the two attempts of 33 personal service and delivery evidenced by an acknowledgment 34 of service. 35 -7- LSB 2581HV (1) 91 cm/jh 7/ 9 H.F. 983 The bill provides that 90 daysâ peaceable possession with 1 the knowledge of the plaintiff after the cause of action 2 accrues is a bar to a forcible entry and detainer proceeding. 3 This is a change from 30 days in current law. 4 The bill provides that in a forcible entry and detainer 5 action, any personal property of the defendant remaining after 6 removal from the premises may be disposed of by the plaintiff. 7 This does not include a mobile home or its contents unless the 8 mobile home is the premises. 9 The bill provides that the defendantâs personal property 10 remaining on the premises after the defendantâs removal may be 11 disposed of by the plaintiff. 12 The bill requires a court to seal the court records of an 13 eviction action not later than three days from the date of the 14 order if any of the following have occurred: the defendant is 15 found not guilty, the case is dismissed, the plaintiff does not 16 appear for the hearing, or if, by motion or upon the courtâs 17 own determination, the court finds there is no genuine issue of 18 material fact between the parties. 19 The bill provides that upon application of a defendant found 20 guilty in an eviction action for nonpayment of rent, the court 21 shall seal the court records if more than seven years have 22 passed since disposition, the applicant has not been found 23 guilty in a subsequent eviction action in the five-year period 24 preceding the application, the applicant within the last 10 25 years has not been granted a sealing of eviction court records, 26 and the applicant has paid all costs. The application to seal 27 shall be included in the sealed court records. 28 The bill requires the court in an eviction action for 29 nonpayment of rent in which the defendant is found guilty to 30 enter an order sealing the court records if the application to 31 seal is filed jointly by the plaintiff and defendant and the 32 defendant has paid all court costs, fees, fines, and any other 33 fees ordered by the court or clerk of the district court in the 34 case. 35 -8- LSB 2581HV (1) 91 cm/jh 8/ 9 H.F. 983 The bill provides that upon sealing the court records, all 1 filings, documentation, and writs of association shall be 2 removed from any publicly accessible location. Sealed court 3 records shall not be available for public inspection except 4 upon request by the defendant or the attorney for the defendant 5 by filing a motion in the sealed case or application to the 6 judicial branch using a form to be prescribed by the supreme 7 court for scholarly, educational, journalistic, or governmental 8 purposes. The bill requires the state court administrator 9 to maintain a record in the aggregate of all filings and to 10 make such information available to the public in such a manner 11 prescribed by the supreme court as to protect the identity of 12 the parties while still providing the public with information 13 relating to eviction actions. 14 Under the bill, certain provisions do not apply to an 15 application to seal a record for an eviction action by a 16 defendant found guilty when a money judgment has been awarded 17 to the plaintiff. 18 Certain provisions of the bill relating to an application to 19 seal do not create an independent cause of action by a tenant 20 for use of lawfully obtained information. 21 The provisions of the bill relating to the sealing of court 22 records take effect July 1, 2026. 23 -9- LSB 2581HV (1) 91 cm/jh 9/ 9
