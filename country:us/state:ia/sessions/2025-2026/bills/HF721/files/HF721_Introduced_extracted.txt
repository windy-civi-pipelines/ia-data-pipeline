Section 97B.7A, subsection 1, Code 2025, is amended 9 by adding the following new paragraph: 10 NEW PARAGRAPH . d.

The bill creates the 25 rebuttable presumption that, if a fiduciaryâs vote aligns with 26 the recommendation of the board of directors of the issuer 27 of the shares or if the fiduciary or a third party conducts 28 and documents an economic analysis showing that the vote is 29 in the best economic interest of the plan participants and 30 beneficiaries, the vote is in the best interest of the plan 31 participants and beneficiaries. The bill prohibits a fiduciary 32 from voting shares of a plan based on any environmental, 33 social, policy, governance, or ideological goal that is 34 not in the best economic interest of plan participants and 35 -10- LSB 2881YH (2) 91 sc/ns 10/ 12 H.F. 721 beneficiaries. 1 The bill requires a fiduciary to annually report to 2 the treasurer of state any vote inconsistent with the 3 recommendation of an issuerâs board of directors and the 4 economic analysis on which the fiduciary relied. This report 5 must be certified by the fiduciaryâs chief executive officer 6 and chief financial officer. 7 The bill also requires a fiduciary to review its economic 8 analysis every three years to ensure that the fiduciaryâs 9 models, procedures, and processes predict the best economic 10 interest of the plan participants and beneficiaries. 11 The bill permits a court to award court costs and reasonable 12 attorney fees to the prevailing party in a suit concerning 13 fiduciary voting responsibilities under the bill. 14 The bill prohibits a proxy advisory firm from providing 15 proxy voting advice regarding shareholder-sponsored proposals 16 to an entity that the state regulates unless the advice is 17 based solely on the best economic interests of the enterpriseâs 18 shareholders. If a proxy advisory firmâs advice follows the 19 recommendation of the board of directors of the issuer of the 20 shares or if the proxy advisory firm conducts and documents an 21 economic analysis demonstrating that the vote is in the best 22 economic interest of the plan participants and beneficiaries, 23 then the advice is presumed to be based solely on the best 24 economic interest of the enterpriseâs shareholders. A proxy 25 advisory firm must submit an annual report to the treasurer of 26 state disclosing any vote inconsistent with the issuerâs board 27 of directorsâ recommendations and the economic analysis on 28 which the proxy advisory firm relied. 29 The bill permits an investor, beneficiary, or participant of 30 a plan to submit a request for the economic analysis conducted 31 for a fiduciaryâs vote to the investment company that owns 32 shares of an enterprise regulated by the state or the plan if 33 the individual has reason to believe the provisions of the bill 34 have not been met. The investment company or plan must respond 35 -11- LSB 2881YH (2) 91 sc/ns 11/ 12 H.F. 721 in writing within 90 days by providing the requested economic 1 analysis or informing the individual that no economic analysis 2 was conducted or the vote aligned with the recommendation 3 of the board of directors of the issuer of the shares. The 4 investment company or plan must provide such a response without 5 cost up to twice annually per consumer. 6 The bill prohibits a financial institution from refusing to 7 provide, terminating, or restricting financial services based 8 on certain nonfinancial factors. If a financial institution 9 refuses to provide, terminates, or restricts financial 10 services, a consumer may request within 90 days a written 11 statement of the specific reasons for the decision, which the 12 financial institution must provide within 14 days. A person 13 who is discriminated against by a financial institution may 14 bring an action to recover damages or seek an injunction. 15 The bill allows the attorney general to investigate any 16 suspected violations of the bill and to enforce the billâs 17 provisions by initiating an action in the name of the state 18 and seeking civil penalties for each violation. Each share 19 not voted in the best economic interest of the shareholder 20 qualifies as a separate violation and constitutes irreparable 21 harm. The bill requires civil penalties to be in equity and 22 to not exceed $1,000 per violation. Civil penalties collected 23 under the bill are deposited in the general fund of the state. 24 The bill makes conforming changes. 25 -12- LSB 2881YH (2) 91 sc/ns 12/ 12

The bill creates the 25 rebuttable presumption that, if a fiduciaryâs vote aligns with 26 the recommendation of the board of directors of the issuer 27 of the shares or if the fiduciary or a third party conducts 28 and documents an economic analysis showing that the vote is 29 in the best economic interest of the plan participants and 30 beneficiaries, the vote is in the best interest of the plan 31 participants and beneficiaries. The bill prohibits a fiduciary 32 from voting shares of a plan based on any environmental, 33 social, policy, governance, or ideological goal that is 34 not in the best economic interest of plan participants and 35 -10- LSB 2881YH (2) 91 sc/ns 10/ 12 H.F. 721 beneficiaries. 1 The bill requires a fiduciary to annually report to 2 the treasurer of state any vote inconsistent with the 3 recommendation of an issuerâs board of directors and the 4 economic analysis on which the fiduciary relied. This report 5 must be certified by the fiduciaryâs chief executive officer 6 and chief financial officer. 7 The bill also requires a fiduciary to review its economic 8 analysis every three years to ensure that the fiduciaryâs 9 models, procedures, and processes predict the best economic 10 interest of the plan participants and beneficiaries. 11 The bill permits a court to award court costs and reasonable 12 attorney fees to the prevailing party in a suit concerning 13 fiduciary voting responsibilities under the bill. 14 The bill prohibits a proxy advisory firm from providing 15 proxy voting advice regarding shareholder-sponsored proposals 16 to an entity that the state regulates unless the advice is 17 based solely on the best economic interests of the enterpriseâs 18 shareholders. If a proxy advisory firmâs advice follows the 19 recommendation of the board of directors of the issuer of the 20 shares or if the proxy advisory firm conducts and documents an 21 economic analysis demonstrating that the vote is in the best 22 economic interest of the plan participants and beneficiaries, 23 then the advice is presumed to be based solely on the best 24 economic interest of the enterpriseâs shareholders. A proxy 25 advisory firm must submit an annual report to the treasurer of 26 state disclosing any vote inconsistent with the issuerâs board 27 of directorsâ recommendations and the economic analysis on 28 which the proxy advisory firm relied. 29 The bill permits an investor, beneficiary, or participant of 30 a plan to submit a request for the economic analysis conducted 31 for a fiduciaryâs vote to the investment company that owns 32 shares of an enterprise regulated by the state or the plan if 33 the individual has reason to believe the provisions of the bill 34 have not been met. The investment company or plan must respond 35 -11- LSB 2881YH (2) 91 sc/ns 11/ 12 H.F. 721 in writing within 90 days by providing the requested economic 1 analysis or informing the individual that no economic analysis 2 was conducted or the vote aligned with the recommendation 3 of the board of directors of the issuer of the shares. The 4 investment company or plan must provide such a response without 5 cost up to twice annually per consumer. 6 The bill prohibits a financial institution from refusing to 7 provide, terminating, or restricting financial services based 8 on certain nonfinancial factors. If a financial institution 9 refuses to provide, terminates, or restricts financial 10 services, a consumer may request within 90 days a written 11 statement of the specific reasons for the decision, which the 12 financial institution must provide within 14 days. A person 13 who is discriminated against by a financial institution may 14 bring an action to recover damages or seek an injunction. 15 The bill allows the attorney general to investigate any 16 suspected violations of the bill and to enforce the billâs 17 provisions by initiating an action in the name of the state 18 and seeking civil penalties for each violation. Each share 19 not voted in the best economic interest of the shareholder 20 qualifies as a separate violation and constitutes irreparable 21 harm. The bill requires civil penalties to be in equity and 22 to not exceed $1,000 per violation. Civil penalties collected 23 under the bill are deposited in the general fund of the state. 24 The bill makes conforming changes. 25 -12- LSB 2881YH (2) 91 sc/ns 12/ 12
