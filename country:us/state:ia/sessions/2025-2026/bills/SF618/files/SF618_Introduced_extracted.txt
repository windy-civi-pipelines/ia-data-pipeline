The 14 program provides funding for fellowships to increase access 15 to family medicine obstetrics practitioners in rural and 16 underserved areas of the state. 17 For all of the programs eliminated in the division, HHS is 18 required to provide matching state funding and fund residency 19 and fellowship positions awarded on or before June 30, 2025, as 20 detailed in the bill. All unencumbered and unobligated moneys 21 related to the programs eliminated in the division shall be 22 transferred to HHS to fund Medicaid graduate medical education 23 efforts. 24 HHS shall create accounts for the deposit of encumbered and 25 obligated moneys for each eliminated program as detailed in the 26 division.

The positions provide 5 financial support for up to seven residents and up to two 6 fellows annually. The board of regents (regents) shall direct 7 the U of I to distribute moneys for positions approved and 8 awarded on or before June 30, 2025, until all residents and 9 fellows have completed or left the positions. The regents must 10 also direct the U of I to create an account for the deposit 11 of moneys encumbered and obligated relating to the positions. 12 Upon the expiration of all residency and fellowship periods, 13 any unencumbered and unobligated moneys in the account shall 14 be appropriated to HHS for Medicaid graduate medical education 15 efforts. Any unobligated or unencumbered moneys in the 16 psychiatry residency and fellowship positions fund are also 17 appropriated to HHS to fund Medicaid graduate medical education 18 efforts. 19 The division takes effect upon the date that HHS notifies 20 the general assembly and the Code editor of the receipt of 21 federal approval for a Medicaid supplemental enhanced payment 22 for the purposes of maximizing federal funding opportunities 23 for graduate medical education, and to increase the number of 24 medical residencies in the state. 25 DIVISION VIII. This division eliminates the health 26 facilities council, and transfers the councilâs duties to HHS. 27 DIVISION IX. This division makes conforming changes to the 28 Code related to the elimination of health facilities council 29 and the transfer of the applicable Code sections. 30 DIVISION X. This division eliminates the board of 31 directors (board) that governs and administers the Iowa 32 health information network (network) and transfers the boardâs 33 administrative duties to the designated entity. Current law 34 requires the designated entity to be a nonprofit corporation. 35 -40- LSB 1555SZ (2) 91 lh/ko 40/ 41 S.F. 618 The bill eliminates the requirement that the corporation be 1 nonprofit. The division creates an exchange advisory committee 2 (committee), appointed by the director of HHS, to govern the 3 network and the designated entity. The division requires 4 HHS to conduct a competitive process every eight years to 5 select a designated entity. Current law prohibits a single 6 industry from being disproportionately represented as voting 7 members of the board, and requires the director of HHS and the 8 director of the Medicaid program or the directorsâ designees 9 to act as voting members. The commissioner of insurance is 10 required to serve on the board as a nonvoting member, and 11 individuals serving in a nonvoting capacity on the board are 12 not included in the total number of authorized members on 13 the board. The division strikes these member requirements. 14 Current law requires the board to ensure the designated entity 15 enters into contracts with each state agency necessary for 16 state reporting requirements, and to develop, implement, and 17 enforce a single patient identifier or alternative mechanism to 18 share secure patient information that is utilized by all health 19 care professionals. The division eliminates these duties for 20 the committee. The division requires the committee to advise 21 HHS regarding the needs relating to the exchange of health 22 information, and to ensure HHS develops, and the designated 23 entity complies with, the standards, requirements, policies, 24 and procedures related to the network. 25 -41- LSB 1555SZ (2) 91 lh/ko 41/ 41

The positions provide 5 financial support for up to seven residents and up to two 6 fellows annually. The board of regents (regents) shall direct 7 the U of I to distribute moneys for positions approved and 8 awarded on or before June 30, 2025, until all residents and 9 fellows have completed or left the positions.

This division eliminates the board of 31 directors (board) that governs and administers the Iowa 32 health information network (network) and transfers the boardâs 33 administrative duties to the designated entity. Current law 34 requires the designated entity to be a nonprofit corporation. 35 -40- LSB 1555SZ (2) 91 lh/ko 40/ 41 S.F. 618 The bill eliminates the requirement that the corporation be 1 nonprofit. The division creates an exchange advisory committee 2 (committee), appointed by the director of HHS, to govern the 3 network and the designated entity. The division requires 4 HHS to conduct a competitive process every eight years to 5 select a designated entity. Current law prohibits a single 6 industry from being disproportionately represented as voting 7 members of the board, and requires the director of HHS and the 8 director of the Medicaid program or the directorsâ designees 9 to act as voting members. The commissioner of insurance is 10 required to serve on the board as a nonvoting member, and 11 individuals serving in a nonvoting capacity on the board are 12 not included in the total number of authorized members on 13 the board. The division strikes these member requirements. 14 Current law requires the board to ensure the designated entity 15 enters into contracts with each state agency necessary for 16 state reporting requirements, and to develop, implement, and 17 enforce a single patient identifier or alternative mechanism to 18 share secure patient information that is utilized by all health 19 care professionals. The division eliminates these duties for 20 the committee. The division requires the committee to advise 21 HHS regarding the needs relating to the exchange of health 22 information, and to ensure HHS develops, and the designated 23 entity complies with, the standards, requirements, policies, 24 and procedures related to the network. 25 -41- LSB 1555SZ (2) 91 lh/ko 41/ 41
