The vendor 20 awarded the contract by DAS shall not outsource any part 21 of the PBM reverse auction or of the automated, real-time, 22 electronic, line-by-line, claim-by-claim review of invoiced 23 PBM prescription drug claims. With technical assistance and 24 support provided by the technology platform operator, DAS shall 25 specify the terms of the participant bidding agreement. 26 The technology platform used to conduct the reverse auction 27 shall be repurposed over the duration of the PBMâs services 28 contract as an automated pharmacy claims adjudication engine 29 to perform real-time, electronic, line-by-line, claim-by-claim 30 review of 100 percent of invoiced PBM drug claims, and to 31 identify all deviations from the specific terms of the PBMâs 32 services contract. 33 DAS is required to reconcile the electronically adjudicated 34 pharmacy claims with PBM invoices on a monthly or quarterly 35 -8- LSB 1499XC (2) 91 nls/ko 8/ 10 S.F. _____ basis to ensure that state payments shall not exceed the terms 1 specified in any PBMâs services contract.
