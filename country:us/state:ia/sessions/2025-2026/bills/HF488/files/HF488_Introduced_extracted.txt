REPEAL. Sections 162.10C and 162.12, Code 2025, 21 are repealed. 22 EXPLANATION 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 24 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 25 BACKGROUND ââ REGULATION. The federal and state governments 26 regulate the care of animals possessed or controlled by certain 27 commercial establishments. The United States department of 28 agriculture (USDA) provides for such regulation under the 29 federal Animal Welfare Act, 7 U.S.C. ch. 54. In Iowa, the 30 department of agriculture and land stewardship (DALS) regulates 31 animals, other than agricultural animals, that are owned or 32 controlled by commercial establishments (Code chapter 162). A 33 commercial establishment includes nonprofit organizations that 34 temporarily hold animals, research facilities, and various 35 -11- LSB 1720YH (4) 91 da/ns 11/ 14 H.F. 488 types of businesses that breed, board, or sell animals (Code 1 section 162.2). 2 BACKGROUND ââ AUTHORIZATIONS. Each type of commercial 3 establishment must operate under an authorization issued and 4 annually renewed by DALS. A certificate of registration must 5 be issued or renewed to a pound (Code section 162.3), animal 6 shelter (Code section 162.4), or research facility (Code 7 section 162.4A); a state license must be issued or renewed 8 to a pet shop (Code section 162.5), boarding kennel (Code 9 section 162.5A), or commercial kennel (Code section 162.6). A 10 state license must also be issued to a dealer (Code section 11 162.7), commercial breeder (Code section 162.8), or public 12 auction (Code section 162.9A). However, these three types of 13 commercial establishments may operate under a federal license 14 issued and renewed by USDA, if also issued and renewed a permit 15 by DALS. 16 BACKGROUND ââ FEES AND FUND. A commercial establishment 17 must pay a fee to DALS for being issued or renewed an 18 authorization (Code section 162.2B). Moneys collected in 19 fees by DALS are deposited into a commercial establishment 20 fund (fund) (Code section 162.2C). Moneys in the fund 21 are appropriated to DALS for purposes of carrying out the 22 provisions of Code chapter 162. 23 BACKGROUND ââ STANDARD OF CARE. A general standard of care 24 applies to all commercial establishments. The commercial 25 establishment must ensure that an animal in its possession 26 or under its control is not lacking adequate feed, adequate 27 water, housing facilities, sanitary control, grooming practices 28 affecting the health of the animal, and veterinary care (Code 29 section 162.10A). A registrant or state licensee must also 30 comply with DALSâ rules adopted to administer and enforce this 31 standard of care. A permittee may meet the standard of care 32 without complying with DALSâ rules. DALS may adopt rules 33 implementing a standard of care for permitted establishments 34 so long as the rules are not more restrictive than the federal 35 -12- LSB 1720YH (4) 91 da/ns 12/ 14 H.F. 488 Animal Welfare Act. A person who commits animal cruelty under 1 Code chapter 717B fails to meet the standard of care as a 2 matter of law. 3 BACKGROUND ââ RECORDKEEPING AND INSPECTIONS. A registrant 4 or state licensee must maintain business records under state 5 law. A permittee may but is not required to maintain business 6 records. DALS may inspect a registrant or state licensee by 7 entering onto its premises and may inspect its records (Code 8 section 162.10B). DALS may monitor a permittee by entering 9 onto its premises for the limited purpose of determining 10 whether the permittee is providing for the required standard 11 of care (Code section 162C.10). In order to enter onto the 12 premises of a permittee, DALS must have reasonable cause 13 supported by an oral or written complaint or a report filed by 14 USDA. 15 BACKGROUND ââ DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS. DALS may take 16 disciplinary action against a commercial establishment 17 by suspending or revoking the commercial establishmentâs 18 authorization (Code section 162.10D). DALS may require 19 that an owner, operator, or employee of a commercial 20 establishment complete a continuing education program which 21 is supervised by DALS. Code section 162.12 repeats earlier 22 provisions, including by allowing DALS to deny a certificate of 23 registration or state license based on standard of care. 24 BACKGROUND ââ PENALTIES. DALS may establish, impose, and 25 assess a civil penalty for an act committed by a commercial 26 establishment which violates an applicable regulation. For 27 an authorized commercial establishment, the amount of the 28 civil penalty cannot exceed $500 per day of a violation, 29 including failing to comply with the required standard of 30 care. For operating a commercial establishment without an 31 authorization, the civil penalty cannot exceed $1,000 per day 32 of a violation (Code section 162.12A). A person who operates 33 a commercial establishment without an authorization, or a 34 commercial establishment that violates the standard of care, 35 -13- LSB 1720YH (4) 91 da/ns 13/ 14 H.F. 488 is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 162.13). A 1 simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more 2 than 30 days and a fine of at least $105 but not more than $855. 3 The person may be required to relinquish animals to DALS for 4 final disposition. The person may also be subject to criminal 5 penalties under Code chapter 717B for animal neglect, abuse, 6 or torture. 7 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ ELIMINATION OF PERMITS. This bill 8 provides that a commercial breeder, dealer, or public auction 9 must operate under a state license rather than a permit. The 10 commercial breeder, dealer, or public auction is subject to the 11 same regulations as other state licensees, including standard 12 of care, maintenance of records, and inspection requirements. 13 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ ELIMINATION OF DUPLICATIVE PROVISION. 14 The bill eliminates a regulation governing disciplinary action 15 included in other provisions (Code section 162.12). 16 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS AND FEES. The 17 bill requires DALS to inspect each commercial establishment at 18 least once during its annual authorization period. If DALS 19 inspects a commercial establishment more than once during 20 that period, the commercial establishment must pay DALS a 21 reinspection fee equal to $150 plus the cost of mileage (Code 22 section 162.2B). The moneys are deposited into the fund (Code 23 section 162.2C). 24 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INCREASE IN CIVIL PENALTIES. The 25 bill doubles the maximum amount of a civil penalty that 26 may be imposed for violating a regulation by a commercial 27 establishment operating under an issued or renewed 28 authorization, not to exceed $1,000. The bill also doubles 29 the maximum amount of a civil penalty that may be imposed for 30 operating without an authorization, not to exceed $2,000. 31 -14- LSB 1720YH (4) 91 da/ns 14/ 14

REPEAL. Sections 162.10C and 162.12, Code 2025, 21 are repealed. 22 EXPLANATION 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 24 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 25 BACKGROUND ââ REGULATION. The federal and state governments 26 regulate the care of animals possessed or controlled by certain 27 commercial establishments. The United States department of 28 agriculture (USDA) provides for such regulation under the 29 federal Animal Welfare Act, 7 U.S.C. ch. 54. In Iowa, the 30 department of agriculture and land stewardship (DALS) regulates 31 animals, other than agricultural animals, that are owned or 32 controlled by commercial establishments (Code chapter 162). A 33 commercial establishment includes nonprofit organizations that 34 temporarily hold animals, research facilities, and various 35 -11- LSB 1720YH (4) 91 da/ns 11/ 14 H.F. 488 types of businesses that breed, board, or sell animals (Code 1 section 162.2). 2 BACKGROUND ââ AUTHORIZATIONS. Each type of commercial 3 establishment must operate under an authorization issued and 4 annually renewed by DALS. A certificate of registration must 5 be issued or renewed to a pound (Code section 162.3), animal 6 shelter (Code section 162.4), or research facility (Code 7 section 162.4A); a state license must be issued or renewed 8 to a pet shop (Code section 162.5), boarding kennel (Code 9 section 162.5A), or commercial kennel (Code section 162.6). A 10 state license must also be issued to a dealer (Code section 11 162.7), commercial breeder (Code section 162.8), or public 12 auction (Code section 162.9A). However, these three types of 13 commercial establishments may operate under a federal license 14 issued and renewed by USDA, if also issued and renewed a permit 15 by DALS. 16 BACKGROUND ââ FEES AND FUND. A commercial establishment 17 must pay a fee to DALS for being issued or renewed an 18 authorization (Code section 162.2B). Moneys collected in 19 fees by DALS are deposited into a commercial establishment 20 fund (fund) (Code section 162.2C). Moneys in the fund 21 are appropriated to DALS for purposes of carrying out the 22 provisions of Code chapter 162. 23 BACKGROUND ââ STANDARD OF CARE. A general standard of care 24 applies to all commercial establishments. The commercial 25 establishment must ensure that an animal in its possession 26 or under its control is not lacking adequate feed, adequate 27 water, housing facilities, sanitary control, grooming practices 28 affecting the health of the animal, and veterinary care (Code 29 section 162.10A). A registrant or state licensee must also 30 comply with DALSâ rules adopted to administer and enforce this 31 standard of care. A permittee may meet the standard of care 32 without complying with DALSâ rules. DALS may adopt rules 33 implementing a standard of care for permitted establishments 34 so long as the rules are not more restrictive than the federal 35 -12- LSB 1720YH (4) 91 da/ns 12/ 14 H.F. 488 Animal Welfare Act. A person who commits animal cruelty under 1 Code chapter 717B fails to meet the standard of care as a 2 matter of law. 3 BACKGROUND ââ RECORDKEEPING AND INSPECTIONS. A registrant 4 or state licensee must maintain business records under state 5 law. A permittee may but is not required to maintain business 6 records. DALS may inspect a registrant or state licensee by 7 entering onto its premises and may inspect its records (Code 8 section 162.10B). DALS may monitor a permittee by entering 9 onto its premises for the limited purpose of determining 10 whether the permittee is providing for the required standard 11 of care (Code section 162C.10). In order to enter onto the 12 premises of a permittee, DALS must have reasonable cause 13 supported by an oral or written complaint or a report filed by 14 USDA. 15 BACKGROUND ââ DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS. DALS may take 16 disciplinary action against a commercial establishment 17 by suspending or revoking the commercial establishmentâs 18 authorization (Code section 162.10D). DALS may require 19 that an owner, operator, or employee of a commercial 20 establishment complete a continuing education program which 21 is supervised by DALS. Code section 162.12 repeats earlier 22 provisions, including by allowing DALS to deny a certificate of 23 registration or state license based on standard of care. 24 BACKGROUND ââ PENALTIES. DALS may establish, impose, and 25 assess a civil penalty for an act committed by a commercial 26 establishment which violates an applicable regulation. For 27 an authorized commercial establishment, the amount of the 28 civil penalty cannot exceed $500 per day of a violation, 29 including failing to comply with the required standard of 30 care. For operating a commercial establishment without an 31 authorization, the civil penalty cannot exceed $1,000 per day 32 of a violation (Code section 162.12A). A person who operates 33 a commercial establishment without an authorization, or a 34 commercial establishment that violates the standard of care, 35 -13- LSB 1720YH (4) 91 da/ns 13/ 14 H.F. 488 is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 162.13). A 1 simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more 2 than 30 days and a fine of at least $105 but not more than $855. 3 The person may be required to relinquish animals to DALS for 4 final disposition. The person may also be subject to criminal 5 penalties under Code chapter 717B for animal neglect, abuse, 6 or torture. 7 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ ELIMINATION OF PERMITS. This bill 8 provides that a commercial breeder, dealer, or public auction 9 must operate under a state license rather than a permit. The 10 commercial breeder, dealer, or public auction is subject to the 11 same regulations as other state licensees, including standard 12 of care, maintenance of records, and inspection requirements. 13 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ ELIMINATION OF DUPLICATIVE PROVISION. 14 The bill eliminates a regulation governing disciplinary action 15 included in other provisions (Code section 162.12). 16 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS AND FEES. The 17 bill requires DALS to inspect each commercial establishment at 18 least once during its annual authorization period. If DALS 19 inspects a commercial establishment more than once during 20 that period, the commercial establishment must pay DALS a 21 reinspection fee equal to $150 plus the cost of mileage (Code 22 section 162.2B). The moneys are deposited into the fund (Code 23 section 162.2C). 24 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INCREASE IN CIVIL PENALTIES. The 25 bill doubles the maximum amount of a civil penalty that 26 may be imposed for violating a regulation by a commercial 27 establishment operating under an issued or renewed 28 authorization, not to exceed $1,000. The bill also doubles 29 the maximum amount of a civil penalty that may be imposed for 30 operating without an authorization, not to exceed $2,000. 31 -14- LSB 1720YH (4) 91 da/ns 14/ 14
