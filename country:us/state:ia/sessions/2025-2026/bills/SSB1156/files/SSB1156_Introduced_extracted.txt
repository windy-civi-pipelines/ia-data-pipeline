The bill strikes the director of the 34 department from involvement in the extension request by the 35 -22- LSB 1390XD (7) 91 jm/jh 22/ 26 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ claimant. 1 Under current law, when issuing a refund for an erroneous 2 property tax paid by a taxpayer, the taxpayer must have 3 presented a claim of refund to the board of supervisors, or if 4 appealed, a claim to the property assessment appeal or district 5 court within two years of the final decision on the property 6 taxes owed.

This provision takes effect upon enactment. 11 DIVISION IV ââ FARM TENANCY INCOME TAX EXCLUSION. 12 Currently, an eligible individual may exclude income received 13 by the individual pursuant to a farm tenancy covering real 14 property held by the individual for 10 or more years, if the 15 individual materially participated in a farming business for 16 10 or more years.

The bill further specifies the term 20 âheldâ is to be determined by the holding period provisions of 21 section 1223 of the Internal Revenue Code and other federal 22 regulations which is identical to the use of the term âheldâ 23 under the farming business exclusion in Code section 422.7(13). 24 DIVISION V ââ PASS-THROUGH ENTITIES. Under current law, 25 the department may issue a notice of adjustment (adjustment of 26 tax) to a partnership or pass-through entity pursuant to Code 27 section 422.25C, and specifies that the notice of adjustment 28 is appealable pursuant to Code sections 422.28 and 422.29. 29 The bill specifies the notice of adjustment is not always 30 appealable under the circumstances provided in Code section 31 422.25. 32 The division takes effect upon enactment and applies 33 retroactively to January 1, 2024. 34 DIVISION VI ââ SALES TAX CHANGES.

The bill makes other related 10 changes to enhance the readability of the provision. 11 Under current law, a purchaser, user, and consumer of 12 taxable property or services may be authorized to remit tax 13 owed directly to the department instead of the tax being 14 collected and paid by the seller. The bill specifies that in 15 order to qualify for the direct pay tax permit such a taxpayer 16 must accrue a tax liability of more than $8,000 on a monthly 17 basis. Currently, such a taxpayer must accrue a tax liability 18 of $4,000 on a semimonthly basis in order to qualify for the 19 direct pay tax permit. 20 DIVISION VII ââ MOTOR FUEL TAXES. Under current law and 21 before July 1, 2026, the department determines the rate of 22 excise tax imposed on each gallon of ethanol blended gasoline 23 based upon the distribution percentage calculated in Code 24 section 452A.3(1)(b), and the excise tax rate imposed on each 25 gallon of biodiesel blended fuel based on the distribution 26 percentage calculated in Code section 453A.3(3)(a)(2). The 27 department determines the distribution percentage based upon 28 data from reports filed pursuant to Code section 452A.33.

The bill changes numerous Code sections to reflect 7 the repeal of the inheritance tax beginning for the estates of 8 decedents dying on or after January 1, 2025. However, other 9 provisions of Code chapter 450 relating to the inheritance 10 tax have not been repealed. The division takes effect upon 11 enactment and applies retroactively to the estates of decedents 12 dying on or after January 1, 2025. 13 DIVISION IX ââ LUMP SUM DISTRIBUTION OF RETIREMENT INCOME. 14 Under current law, commencing with tax years beginning on or 15 after January 1, 2023, retirement income is not subject to 16 Iowa individual income tax. However, under current law a lump 17 sum distribution from a retirement account is subject to Iowa 18 income tax under Code section 422.5(8) at a rate of 25 percent 19 of the federal tax rate imposed on the amount of the lump sum 20 distribution. 21 The bill provides that the taxation of a lump sum 22 distribution from a retirement account is also exempt from 23 state taxation by exempting the lump sum distribution for a 24 person who is disabled, or 55 years of age or older, or who is 25 the surviving spouse of an individual or is a survivor having 26 an insurable interest in an individual who would have qualified 27 for the exemption for the tax year. 28 The bill excludes the lump sum distribution exempt from 29 state taxation from being included in calculating the 30 individual income tax filing thresholds in Code section 31 422.5(2) and (3). 32 The division takes effect upon enactment and applies 33 retroactively to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 34 2025. 35 -25- LSB 1390XD (7) 91 jm/jh 25/ 26 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ DIVISION X ââ ESTIMATED TAX THRESHOLD. Under the bill, 1 a taxpayer filing a return is required to make estimated 2 tax payments if Iowa income tax liability can reasonably be 3 expected to exceed $1,000 or more. Under current law, such 4 a taxpayer filing a return is required to make estimated 5 tax payments if Iowa income tax liability can reasonably be 6 expected to exceed $200 or more. 7 The division takes effect January 1, 2026, and applies to tax 8 years beginning on or after that date. 9 DIVISION XI ââ TAX EXPENDITURE REVIEW. The bill specifies 10 that the department administering a tax expenditure (tax 11 credit) is not required to review the tax expenditure if the 12 tax expenditure has been repealed or if a zero amount of the 13 tax expenditure remains available to be awarded or claimed. 14 The bill removes four tax expenditures from tax expenditure 15 review: the Iowa fund of funds program in Code chapter 15E, 16 the wind energy production tax credits under Code chapter 476B, 17 the ethanol promotion tax credit in Code section 422.11N (Code 18 2006), and the minimum tax credit under Code section 422.11B 19 (Code 2018). The bill amends the Acts to align the review of 20 the renewable chemical production tax credit in Code section 21 2.48 with the future repeal of the renewable chemical tax 22 credit program. 23 -26- LSB 1390XD (7) 91 jm/jh 26/ 26

The bill specifies that in 15 order to qualify for the direct pay tax permit such a taxpayer 16 must accrue a tax liability of more than $8,000 on a monthly 17 basis. Currently, such a taxpayer must accrue a tax liability 18 of $4,000 on a semimonthly basis in order to qualify for the 19 direct pay tax permit. 20 DIVISION VII ââ MOTOR FUEL TAXES.

The division takes effect upon 11 enactment and applies retroactively to the estates of decedents 12 dying on or after January 1, 2025. 13 DIVISION IX ââ LUMP SUM DISTRIBUTION OF RETIREMENT INCOME. 14 Under current law, commencing with tax years beginning on or 15 after January 1, 2023, retirement income is not subject to 16 Iowa individual income tax. However, under current law a lump 17 sum distribution from a retirement account is subject to Iowa 18 income tax under Code section 422.5(8) at a rate of 25 percent 19 of the federal tax rate imposed on the amount of the lump sum 20 distribution. 21 The bill provides that the taxation of a lump sum 22 distribution from a retirement account is also exempt from 23 state taxation by exempting the lump sum distribution for a 24 person who is disabled, or 55 years of age or older, or who is 25 the surviving spouse of an individual or is a survivor having 26 an insurable interest in an individual who would have qualified 27 for the exemption for the tax year. 28 The bill excludes the lump sum distribution exempt from 29 state taxation from being included in calculating the 30 individual income tax filing thresholds in Code section 31 422.5(2) and (3). 32 The division takes effect upon enactment and applies 33 retroactively to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 34 2025. 35 -25- LSB 1390XD (7) 91 jm/jh 25/ 26 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ DIVISION X ââ ESTIMATED TAX THRESHOLD.

The bill specifies 10 that the department administering a tax expenditure (tax 11 credit) is not required to review the tax expenditure if the 12 tax expenditure has been repealed or if a zero amount of the 13 tax expenditure remains available to be awarded or claimed. 14 The bill removes four tax expenditures from tax expenditure 15 review: the Iowa fund of funds program in Code chapter 15E, 16 the wind energy production tax credits under Code chapter 476B, 17 the ethanol promotion tax credit in Code section 422.11N (Code 18 2006), and the minimum tax credit under Code section 422.11B 19 (Code 2018).
