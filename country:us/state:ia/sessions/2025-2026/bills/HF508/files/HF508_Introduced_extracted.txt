The licensed grain dealer is subject to a penalty 17 of ten dollars for each day the licensed grain dealer is 18 delinquent or an amount equal to the amount of the deficiency, 19 whichever is less. However, a licensee licensed grain dealer 20 who fails to submit remit the full quarterly per-bushel fee or 21 quarterly forms form when due , is subject to a minimum payment 22 of ten dollars. The department may establish and apply a 23 margin of error in determining whether a licensed grain dealer 24 is delinquent. The per-bushel fee shall be collected only once 25 on each bushel of grain. 26 c. d. The per-bushel fee shall not be collected more 27 than once on each bushel of grain. A licensed grain dealer 28 may choose to pass on the cost of a per-bushel fee to the 29 sellers by an itemized discount noted on the settlement sheet. 30 However, if the per-bushel fee is not in effect, no a licensed 31 grain dealer shall not make such a discount on the purchase of 32 grain. A discount made nominally for the per-bushel fee while 33 the per-bushel fee is not in effect is grounds for a license 34 suspension or revocation under chapter 203 . 35 -6- LSB 2306HV (3) 91 da/ns 6/ 17 H.F. 508 Sec. 13.

If there is neither a department 3 receivership nor a bankruptcy filing, the dollar value of 4 a loss shall be presumed to be based upon the fair market 5 price, free-on-board from the site of the warehouse operator, 6 being paid to producers for grain by the grain terminal 7 operator nearest the warehouse operator on the date of license 8 revocation or cancellation incurrence date . If more than 9 one incurrence date applies to a claim, the board may choose 10 between the two.

This 35 -11- LSB 2306HV (3) 91 da/ns 11/ 17 H.F. 508 bill amends provisions regulating marketers of grain, referred 1 to as grain dealers purchasing grain (Code chapter 203), and 2 grain warehouse operators storing grain under bailment (Code 3 chapter 203C). The bill also provides for sellers of grain to 4 licensed grain dealers, and depositors storing grain with a 5 licensed grain warehouse, by indemnifying losses resulting from 6 the sale or deposit (Code chapter 203D). 7 BACKGROUND ââ LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS. The department of 8 agriculture and land stewardship (DALS) licenses a grain dealer 9 purchasing at least 1,000 bushels from producers of that grain 10 (sellers) during any calendar month (Code section 203.1). DALS 11 licenses a warehouse operator in the business of operating a 12 warehouse for the storage of bushels on behalf of title holders 13 (depositors) (Code section 203C.1). Alternatively, a warehouse 14 operator may be regulated by the United States department of 15 agriculture under the United States Warehouse Act (7 U.S.C. 16 ch. 10). A state license application must be accompanied by 17 a financial statement (Code sections 203.3 and 203C.6). A 18 grain dealer must meet certain net worth requirements to be 19 issued a class 1 license and purchase grain by credit-sale 20 contract. Normally, a grain dealerâs financial statement 21 must be accompanied by an unqualified opinion based upon an 22 audit performed by a certified public accountant licensed in 23 this state. However, DALS may accept a qualification in an 24 opinion because of the audit procedures used. DALS may also 25 accept a review by a certified public accountant in lieu of an 26 unqualified opinion. 27 BACKGROUND ââ CREDIT-SALE CONTRACTS. A credit-sale 28 contract (also referred to as deferred-payment contract, 29 deferred-pricing contract, or price-later contract) involves a 30 transaction for the sale of grain in which the grainâs producer 31 is the seller and the licensed grain dealer is the buyer. The 32 purchase price is to be paid to the seller by the licensed 33 grain dealer more than 30 days after the sellerâs delivery of 34 the grain to the licensed grain dealer or a person designated 35 -12- LSB 2306HV (3) 91 da/ns 12/ 17 H.F. 508 by the licensed grain dealer (Code sections 203.1 and 203.8). 1 Generally, there are two types of credit-sale contracts, a 2 deferred-pricing contract and a deferred-payment contract. 3 In both cases, the sellerâs payment amount is delayed until 4 after the sale (transfer of title) and delivery. Under a 5 deferred-pricing contract, the payment amount is unknown at 6 the time of sale and delivery, with the expectation that the 7 seller will receive a higher price in the future. Under 8 a deferred-payment contract, the purchase price has been 9 determined upon, or within a short time after, the grainâs 10 sale and delivery. By deferring payment, the seller elects to 11 claim income from the sale in the subsequent tax year assuming 12 a more beneficial tax rate will apply in that year (e.g., 13 expecting a reduction in farm income). In order to purchase 14 grain under a credit sale contract, a licensed grain dealer 15 must comply with a number of requirements, including a number 16 of financial conditions based on net worth or a deficiency bond 17 or irrevocable letter of credit. The licensed grain dealerâs 18 last financial statement must be accompanied by an unqualified 19 opinion by a certified public accountant or alternatively the 20 licensed grain dealer must file a bond with DALS in the amount 21 of $100,000. 22 BACKGROUND ââ GRAIN DEPOSITORS AND SELLERS INDEMNITY 23 FUND. A seller selling grain to a licensed grain dealer or a 24 depositor depositing grain with a licensed warehouse operator 25 may be reimbursed for a loss incurred by the failure of the 26 licensee to honor a contractual obligation regarding the 27 transaction (Code section 203D.6). A payment is made from 28 the grain depositors and sellers indemnity fund (indemnity 29 fund) upon a determination that the claim is eligible for 30 indemnification by the Iowa grain indemnity fund board 31 (indemnity board) acting in cooperation with DALS. To be 32 timely, a claim must be filed within a claim period. The claim 33 period begins on either of two incurrence dates and ends 120 34 days later. An incurrence date is either when the license of 35 -13- LSB 2306HV (3) 91 da/ns 13/ 17 H.F. 508 the grain dealer or warehouse operatorâs license ceases (is 1 revoked or voluntarily canceled) or the date a petition is 2 filed in bankruptcy. 3 BACKGROUND ââ FEES. In addition to license fees deposited 4 into the general fund of the state (Code sections 203.6 and 5 203C.33), each licensee may be required to remit either one or 6 two special fees (indemnity fees) deposited in the indemnity 7 fund, referred to as a participation fee and per-bushel fee. 8 The licensed grain dealerâs participation fee is calculated 9 according to the following formula: the assessment rate of not 10 more than $0.014 multiplied by all bushels of purchased grain 11 during the grain dealerâs prior fiscal year with a minimum 12 of $50 and no maximum limit. The licensed grain dealerâs 13 per-bushel fee is calculated according to a similar formula: 14 the assessment rate of not more than $0.25 multiplied by all 15 bushels of purchased grain for the grain dealerâs assessment 16 year with no minimum and a $500 maximum limit. The qualifying 17 term âpurchased grainâ equals the total number of bushels 18 purchased from sellers minus a number of exempt bushels 19 purchased, including those purchased under credit-sale contract 20 (Code section 203D.1). Purchased grain is reported to DALS 21 as âpaid company-ownedâ (Code section 203D.1). The licensed 22 warehouse operatorâs participation fee is based on the number 23 of bushels of storage capacity of the warehouse (Code section 24 203D.5). An assessment year begins September 1 and ends August 25 31 (Code sections 203D.3 and 203D.5). The assessment year is 26 further divided into four three-month assessment quarters. A 27 grain dealer or warehouse operator may remit a participation 28 fee annually (with an application for an initial license or the 29 renewal of a license) or on a quarterly basis. A grain dealer 30 must remit a per-bushel fee on a quarterly basis (Code section 31 203D.3A). 32 BACKGROUND ââ INDEMNITY BOARD REVIEW OF INDEMNITY FUND. The 33 indemnity board must annually review the debits of and credits 34 to the indemnity fund and by May 1 determine whether to impose 35 -14- LSB 2306HV (3) 91 da/ns 14/ 17 H.F. 508 the indemnity fees, make adjustments to the existing indemnity 1 fees, or waive the existing indemnity fees as necessary to 2 comply with two triggers. The balance in the indemnity fund 3 triggers the indemnity fees waiver or reinstatement (Code 4 section 203D.5). When the balance in the indemnity fund 5 reaches $8 million, the indemnity fees are automatically 6 waived. The indemnity fees are reinstated by the indemnity 7 board if the balance in the fund is $3 million or less (Code 8 section 203D.5). The triggered waiver or reinstatement is 9 effective on the first day of the following assessment year 10 (September 1). A licensee is required to remit the outstanding 11 amount of the waived participation fee that is otherwise owing 12 for the current assessment year. However, a licensed grain 13 dealer is no longer obligated to remit the outstanding amount 14 of the per-bushel fee otherwise owing for that period, unless 15 the amount is delinquent (Code section 203D.5). 16 BACKGROUND ââ INDEMNITY FUND ââ VALUE OF LOSS. Generally, 17 a loss incurred by a depositor (holding a warehouse receipt 18 or scale weight ticket) or seller who is a party to a sale 19 may be determined using several methods of valuation. For 20 a depositor, it may be a court order hearing a matter in 21 receivership. Otherwise, the loss is based on the fair market 22 price paid to producer sellers at a nearby terminal on an 23 incurrence date. For a seller, it may be the sales price 24 agreed to by the parties. If the grain has not yet been priced, 25 the loss is again based on the fair market price paid at the 26 terminal on one of those incurrence dates. In any case, from 27 the determined loss is deducted any amount recovered by the 28 depositor or seller through other legal or equitable remedies, 29 including the liquidation of assets (Code section 203D.6). 30 BACKGROUND ââ INDEMNITY FUND ââ PAYMENT OF CLAIMS. A 31 claim must meet eligibility requirements, including that it 32 is timely filed, there is evidence of a loss incurred by a 33 claimant, and the claim derives from a covered transaction. 34 For a claimant who is a depositor, a covered transaction 35 -15- LSB 2306HV (3) 91 da/ns 15/ 17 H.F. 508 requires that the grain must have been delivered to a licensed 1 warehouse operator. For a claimant who is a seller, a covered 2 transaction requires that title be transferred within six 3 months of the incurrence date. A covered transaction excludes 4 sale by credit-sale contract. A seller or depositor is 5 entitled to be reimbursed 90 percent of a loss but not more 6 than $300,000. 7 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ CREDIT-SALE CONTRACTS ââ LICENSED GRAIN 8 DEALERâS FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. The bill amends financial 9 conditions required for a licensed grain dealer holding a 10 class 1 license to purchase grain by credit-sale contract. 11 Specifically, a licensed grain dealer who did not submit a 12 financial statement accompanied by an unqualified opinion must 13 file a bond with DALS for $250,000. 14 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FEES ââ PAYMENT SCHEDULE. 15 The bill provides that a grain dealer or warehouse operator 16 may pay the participation fee in one installment as part of 17 the license renewal or on four successive installment dates on 18 December 15, March 15, June 15, and September 15. The bill 19 provides that the grain dealer must pay the per-bushel fee on 20 the same installment dates. 21 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FEES ââ TRIGGERS. The bill 22 adjusts both triggers waiving or reinstating the two indemnity 23 fees. The bill increases from $8 million to $16 million the 24 balance in the indemnity fund required to trigger a waiver and 25 increases from $3 million to $8 million the balance in the 26 indemnity fund required to trigger a reinstatement. 27 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FEES IMPOSED ON CREDIT-SALE 28 CONTRACT TRANSACTIONS. The bill provides that grain sold by 29 deferred-pricing contract is considered purchased grain and 30 grain sold by deferred-payment contract is not. Therefore, a 31 licensed grain dealer is only assessed an indemnity fee on the 32 deferred-pricing contract grain. 33 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FUND ââ DOLLAR VALUE OF 34 LOSS. The bill provides special valuation rules for losses 35 -16- LSB 2306HV (3) 91 da/ns 16/ 17 H.F. 508 involving corn or soybeans. The dollar value of a loss 1 for corn cannot exceed the dollar value for a loss of U.S. 2 No. 2 yellow corn according to grain standards adopted by 3 the federal grain inspection service of the United States 4 department of agriculture. The dollar value of a loss for 5 soybeans cannot exceed the dollar value of a loss for U.S. No. 6 2 yellow soybeans according to grain standards adopted by that 7 same agency. A dollar loss incurred under a deferred-pricing 8 contract is presumed the same as any other loss in which the 9 price for the grain has not been determined (e.g., determined 10 by the fair market price at the nearest terminal on the 11 incurrence date). 12 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FUND ââ PAYMENT OF CLAIMS. 13 The bill provides that the sale of grain by deferred-pricing 14 contract is no longer excluded from the meaning of a covered 15 transaction and a seller may therefore claim a dollar loss 16 resulting from the grain dealerâs default. The bill provides 17 for the payment to claimants based on an order of priority. 18 The first priority is provided to a depositor or seller, other 19 than a seller who sold grain by credit-sale contract. The 20 payout remains the same: 90 percent of the loss but not more 21 than $300,000. The second priority is provided to a seller 22 who sold grain pursuant to a deferred-pricing contract. In 23 that case, the payout is reduced to 70 percent of the loss but 24 not more than $210,000. A deferred-payment contract remains 25 ineligible for payment. 26 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FUND ââ ORDER OF PAYMENTS. 27 The board may determine when payments are to be made 28 depending upon moneys in the indemnity fund. Payments are 29 to be made on an equal basis between depositors and sellers 30 with one exception. A seller whose grain was sold under a 31 deferred-pricing contract is indemnified after depositors and 32 other sellers. 33 -17- LSB 2306HV (3) 91 da/ns 17/ 17

(1) If at any time the board determines that there 14 are insufficient funds moneys in the fund to make payment of 15 indemnify all claims, the board may shall order that payment be 16 deferred on specified claims be indemnified according to the 17 following order: 18 (a) First to depositors and sellers equally as determined 19 by the board, except for sellers who sold the grain pursuant 20 to deferred-pricing contracts . 21 (b) Second to sellers who sold the grain pursuant to 22 deferred-pricing contracts. 23 (2) The board may establish one or more claim 24 indemnification periods based on the amount of moneys in the 25 fund and the amount required to indemnify all eligible claims. 26 The department , upon the boardâs instruction, shall hold those 27 unindemnified claims for payment until the board determines 28 that the fund again contains sufficient assets until the next 29 payment period or payment periods as moneys in the fund are 30 available . 31 EXPLANATION 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 33 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 34 BACKGROUND ââ GRAIN DEALERS AND WAREHOUSE OPERATORS. This 35 -11- LSB 2306HV (3) 91 da/ns 11/ 17 H.F. 508 bill amends provisions regulating marketers of grain, referred 1 to as grain dealers purchasing grain (Code chapter 203), and 2 grain warehouse operators storing grain under bailment (Code 3 chapter 203C). The bill also provides for sellers of grain to 4 licensed grain dealers, and depositors storing grain with a 5 licensed grain warehouse, by indemnifying losses resulting from 6 the sale or deposit (Code chapter 203D). 7 BACKGROUND ââ LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS. The department of 8 agriculture and land stewardship (DALS) licenses a grain dealer 9 purchasing at least 1,000 bushels from producers of that grain 10 (sellers) during any calendar month (Code section 203.1). DALS 11 licenses a warehouse operator in the business of operating a 12 warehouse for the storage of bushels on behalf of title holders 13 (depositors) (Code section 203C.1). Alternatively, a warehouse 14 operator may be regulated by the United States department of 15 agriculture under the United States Warehouse Act (7 U.S.C. 16 ch. 10). A state license application must be accompanied by 17 a financial statement (Code sections 203.3 and 203C.6). A 18 grain dealer must meet certain net worth requirements to be 19 issued a class 1 license and purchase grain by credit-sale 20 contract. Normally, a grain dealerâs financial statement 21 must be accompanied by an unqualified opinion based upon an 22 audit performed by a certified public accountant licensed in 23 this state. However, DALS may accept a qualification in an 24 opinion because of the audit procedures used. DALS may also 25 accept a review by a certified public accountant in lieu of an 26 unqualified opinion. 27 BACKGROUND ââ CREDIT-SALE CONTRACTS. A credit-sale 28 contract (also referred to as deferred-payment contract, 29 deferred-pricing contract, or price-later contract) involves a 30 transaction for the sale of grain in which the grainâs producer 31 is the seller and the licensed grain dealer is the buyer. The 32 purchase price is to be paid to the seller by the licensed 33 grain dealer more than 30 days after the sellerâs delivery of 34 the grain to the licensed grain dealer or a person designated 35 -12- LSB 2306HV (3) 91 da/ns 12/ 17 H.F. 508 by the licensed grain dealer (Code sections 203.1 and 203.8). 1 Generally, there are two types of credit-sale contracts, a 2 deferred-pricing contract and a deferred-payment contract. 3 In both cases, the sellerâs payment amount is delayed until 4 after the sale (transfer of title) and delivery. Under a 5 deferred-pricing contract, the payment amount is unknown at 6 the time of sale and delivery, with the expectation that the 7 seller will receive a higher price in the future. Under 8 a deferred-payment contract, the purchase price has been 9 determined upon, or within a short time after, the grainâs 10 sale and delivery. By deferring payment, the seller elects to 11 claim income from the sale in the subsequent tax year assuming 12 a more beneficial tax rate will apply in that year (e.g., 13 expecting a reduction in farm income). In order to purchase 14 grain under a credit sale contract, a licensed grain dealer 15 must comply with a number of requirements, including a number 16 of financial conditions based on net worth or a deficiency bond 17 or irrevocable letter of credit. The licensed grain dealerâs 18 last financial statement must be accompanied by an unqualified 19 opinion by a certified public accountant or alternatively the 20 licensed grain dealer must file a bond with DALS in the amount 21 of $100,000. 22 BACKGROUND ââ GRAIN DEPOSITORS AND SELLERS INDEMNITY 23 FUND. A seller selling grain to a licensed grain dealer or a 24 depositor depositing grain with a licensed warehouse operator 25 may be reimbursed for a loss incurred by the failure of the 26 licensee to honor a contractual obligation regarding the 27 transaction (Code section 203D.6). A payment is made from 28 the grain depositors and sellers indemnity fund (indemnity 29 fund) upon a determination that the claim is eligible for 30 indemnification by the Iowa grain indemnity fund board 31 (indemnity board) acting in cooperation with DALS. To be 32 timely, a claim must be filed within a claim period. The claim 33 period begins on either of two incurrence dates and ends 120 34 days later. An incurrence date is either when the license of 35 -13- LSB 2306HV (3) 91 da/ns 13/ 17 H.F. 508 the grain dealer or warehouse operatorâs license ceases (is 1 revoked or voluntarily canceled) or the date a petition is 2 filed in bankruptcy. 3 BACKGROUND ââ FEES. In addition to license fees deposited 4 into the general fund of the state (Code sections 203.6 and 5 203C.33), each licensee may be required to remit either one or 6 two special fees (indemnity fees) deposited in the indemnity 7 fund, referred to as a participation fee and per-bushel fee. 8 The licensed grain dealerâs participation fee is calculated 9 according to the following formula: the assessment rate of not 10 more than $0.014 multiplied by all bushels of purchased grain 11 during the grain dealerâs prior fiscal year with a minimum 12 of $50 and no maximum limit. The licensed grain dealerâs 13 per-bushel fee is calculated according to a similar formula: 14 the assessment rate of not more than $0.25 multiplied by all 15 bushels of purchased grain for the grain dealerâs assessment 16 year with no minimum and a $500 maximum limit. The qualifying 17 term âpurchased grainâ equals the total number of bushels 18 purchased from sellers minus a number of exempt bushels 19 purchased, including those purchased under credit-sale contract 20 (Code section 203D.1). Purchased grain is reported to DALS 21 as âpaid company-ownedâ (Code section 203D.1). The licensed 22 warehouse operatorâs participation fee is based on the number 23 of bushels of storage capacity of the warehouse (Code section 24 203D.5). An assessment year begins September 1 and ends August 25 31 (Code sections 203D.3 and 203D.5). The assessment year is 26 further divided into four three-month assessment quarters. A 27 grain dealer or warehouse operator may remit a participation 28 fee annually (with an application for an initial license or the 29 renewal of a license) or on a quarterly basis. A grain dealer 30 must remit a per-bushel fee on a quarterly basis (Code section 31 203D.3A). 32 BACKGROUND ââ INDEMNITY BOARD REVIEW OF INDEMNITY FUND. The 33 indemnity board must annually review the debits of and credits 34 to the indemnity fund and by May 1 determine whether to impose 35 -14- LSB 2306HV (3) 91 da/ns 14/ 17 H.F. 508 the indemnity fees, make adjustments to the existing indemnity 1 fees, or waive the existing indemnity fees as necessary to 2 comply with two triggers. The balance in the indemnity fund 3 triggers the indemnity fees waiver or reinstatement (Code 4 section 203D.5). When the balance in the indemnity fund 5 reaches $8 million, the indemnity fees are automatically 6 waived. The indemnity fees are reinstated by the indemnity 7 board if the balance in the fund is $3 million or less (Code 8 section 203D.5). The triggered waiver or reinstatement is 9 effective on the first day of the following assessment year 10 (September 1). A licensee is required to remit the outstanding 11 amount of the waived participation fee that is otherwise owing 12 for the current assessment year. However, a licensed grain 13 dealer is no longer obligated to remit the outstanding amount 14 of the per-bushel fee otherwise owing for that period, unless 15 the amount is delinquent (Code section 203D.5). 16 BACKGROUND ââ INDEMNITY FUND ââ VALUE OF LOSS. Generally, 17 a loss incurred by a depositor (holding a warehouse receipt 18 or scale weight ticket) or seller who is a party to a sale 19 may be determined using several methods of valuation. For 20 a depositor, it may be a court order hearing a matter in 21 receivership. Otherwise, the loss is based on the fair market 22 price paid to producer sellers at a nearby terminal on an 23 incurrence date. For a seller, it may be the sales price 24 agreed to by the parties. If the grain has not yet been priced, 25 the loss is again based on the fair market price paid at the 26 terminal on one of those incurrence dates. In any case, from 27 the determined loss is deducted any amount recovered by the 28 depositor or seller through other legal or equitable remedies, 29 including the liquidation of assets (Code section 203D.6). 30 BACKGROUND ââ INDEMNITY FUND ââ PAYMENT OF CLAIMS. A 31 claim must meet eligibility requirements, including that it 32 is timely filed, there is evidence of a loss incurred by a 33 claimant, and the claim derives from a covered transaction. 34 For a claimant who is a depositor, a covered transaction 35 -15- LSB 2306HV (3) 91 da/ns 15/ 17 H.F. 508 requires that the grain must have been delivered to a licensed 1 warehouse operator. For a claimant who is a seller, a covered 2 transaction requires that title be transferred within six 3 months of the incurrence date. A covered transaction excludes 4 sale by credit-sale contract. A seller or depositor is 5 entitled to be reimbursed 90 percent of a loss but not more 6 than $300,000. 7 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ CREDIT-SALE CONTRACTS ââ LICENSED GRAIN 8 DEALERâS FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. The bill amends financial 9 conditions required for a licensed grain dealer holding a 10 class 1 license to purchase grain by credit-sale contract. 11 Specifically, a licensed grain dealer who did not submit a 12 financial statement accompanied by an unqualified opinion must 13 file a bond with DALS for $250,000. 14 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FEES ââ PAYMENT SCHEDULE. 15 The bill provides that a grain dealer or warehouse operator 16 may pay the participation fee in one installment as part of 17 the license renewal or on four successive installment dates on 18 December 15, March 15, June 15, and September 15. The bill 19 provides that the grain dealer must pay the per-bushel fee on 20 the same installment dates. 21 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FEES ââ TRIGGERS. The bill 22 adjusts both triggers waiving or reinstating the two indemnity 23 fees. The bill increases from $8 million to $16 million the 24 balance in the indemnity fund required to trigger a waiver and 25 increases from $3 million to $8 million the balance in the 26 indemnity fund required to trigger a reinstatement. 27 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FEES IMPOSED ON CREDIT-SALE 28 CONTRACT TRANSACTIONS. The bill provides that grain sold by 29 deferred-pricing contract is considered purchased grain and 30 grain sold by deferred-payment contract is not. Therefore, a 31 licensed grain dealer is only assessed an indemnity fee on the 32 deferred-pricing contract grain. 33 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FUND ââ DOLLAR VALUE OF 34 LOSS. The bill provides special valuation rules for losses 35 -16- LSB 2306HV (3) 91 da/ns 16/ 17 H.F. 508 involving corn or soybeans. The dollar value of a loss 1 for corn cannot exceed the dollar value for a loss of U.S. 2 No. 2 yellow corn according to grain standards adopted by 3 the federal grain inspection service of the United States 4 department of agriculture. The dollar value of a loss for 5 soybeans cannot exceed the dollar value of a loss for U.S. No. 6 2 yellow soybeans according to grain standards adopted by that 7 same agency. A dollar loss incurred under a deferred-pricing 8 contract is presumed the same as any other loss in which the 9 price for the grain has not been determined (e.g., determined 10 by the fair market price at the nearest terminal on the 11 incurrence date). 12 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FUND ââ PAYMENT OF CLAIMS. 13 The bill provides that the sale of grain by deferred-pricing 14 contract is no longer excluded from the meaning of a covered 15 transaction and a seller may therefore claim a dollar loss 16 resulting from the grain dealerâs default. The bill provides 17 for the payment to claimants based on an order of priority. 18 The first priority is provided to a depositor or seller, other 19 than a seller who sold grain by credit-sale contract. The 20 payout remains the same: 90 percent of the loss but not more 21 than $300,000. The second priority is provided to a seller 22 who sold grain pursuant to a deferred-pricing contract. In 23 that case, the payout is reduced to 70 percent of the loss but 24 not more than $210,000. A deferred-payment contract remains 25 ineligible for payment. 26 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FUND ââ ORDER OF PAYMENTS. 27 The board may determine when payments are to be made 28 depending upon moneys in the indemnity fund. Payments are 29 to be made on an equal basis between depositors and sellers 30 with one exception. A seller whose grain was sold under a 31 deferred-pricing contract is indemnified after depositors and 32 other sellers. 33 -17- LSB 2306HV (3) 91 da/ns 17/ 17
