REPEAL. Sections 216A.136, 216A.137, and 33 216A.138, Code 2025, are repealed. 34 Sec. 21. APPLICABILITY. The following apply to contracts 35 -12- LSB 1362HV (2) 91 sc/ns 12/ 15 H.F. 756 entered into or renewed on or after the effective date of this 1 Act: 2 1. The section of this Act enacting section 8.94. 3 2. The section of this Act enacting section 8.95. 4 3. The section of this Act enacting section 8.96. 5 EXPLANATION 6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 7 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 8 This bill relates to matters under the purview of the 9 department of management (DOM). 10 Under current law, the governorâs budget recommendation is 11 considered confidential by the legislative services agency 12 until it is made public by the governor. The bill states that 13 information transmitted by state entities to DOM for developing 14 the budget as required by law, and documents based on the 15 transmittals, are confidential until the governor transmits the 16 budget to the general assembly. 17 The bill strikes current law providing for the use of moneys 18 in the technology reinvestment fund for certain technology 19 projects and instead appropriates moneys in the fund to DOM for 20 technology projects using factors set forth in the bill. The 21 bill requires DOM to provide a prioritized list of proposed 22 projects to the governor, who must use the list to develop 23 a budgetary recommendation to the general assembly, and to 24 report completed and ongoing projects to the general assembly 25 annually. 26 The bill increases the frequency at which a person 27 performing work for DOM or an individual on the information 28 technology staff of a supported entity may be subject to a 29 national criminal history check through the federal bureau of 30 investigation from at least once every 10 years to every 5 31 years. 32 The bill prohibits the inclusion of certain provisions in 33 information technology contracts and declares those provisions 34 void if present in such contracts. The bill also provides that 35 -13- LSB 1362HV (2) 91 sc/ns 13/ 15 H.F. 756 such contracts are deemed to include provisions requiring the 1 contract to be governed by Iowa law and litigation related to 2 the contract to be brought and maintained in an appropriate 3 state or federal court sitting in Iowa. The bill authorizes 4 the director of DOM to include limitations of vendor liability 5 in information technology goods and services contracts, but 6 sets forth prohibited terms in such limitations of liability. 7 The bill makes all communication concerning cybersecurity 8 between the chief information security officer and other 9 entities confidential and allows the communications to be 10 released only for specific purposes. 11 Under current law, the department of health and human 12 services serves as the Iowa statistical analysis center and 13 maintains an integrated information system for data sharing 14 among federal, state, and local governments. The bill 15 transfers these powers and duties to DOM and grants DOM access 16 to criminal justice information other than intelligence data 17 and peace officer investigative reports maintained by the 18 department of public safety. DOM is authorized to provide 19 data analysis and reporting on issues that may affect the 20 stateâs correctional population and various subgroups of the 21 population, to maintain a multiagency information system to 22 track the progress of juveniles and adults charged with a 23 criminal offense through state and local agencies and programs, 24 and to count and track decision points for individuals in 25 the juvenile justice system, child welfare system, and 26 court system. If DOM lacks sufficient moneys to perform the 27 authorized tasks of the Iowa statistical analysis center, the 28 bill allows DOM to determine which, if any, to implement. 29 The bill states that DOM is not the lawful custodian under 30 Code chapter 22 (open records) for records DOM maintains in 31 DOMâs information technology capacity for other state entities 32 as an automated data processing unit of government or when 33 held by DOM solely for storage for another department or 34 establishment. The bill requires DOM to deny requests for 35 -14- LSB 1362HV (2) 91 sc/ns 14/ 15 H.F. 756 information for which DOM is not the lawful custodian, to 1 provide assistance to the lawful custodian to comply with 2 production obligations, and to cooperate in any efforts to 3 resist associated subpoenas. 4 -15- LSB 1362HV (2) 91 sc/ns 15/ 15

Section 232.147, subsection 3, paragraph n, Code 17 2025, is amended to read as follows: 18 n. The statistical analysis center for the purposes stated 19 in section 216A.136 8.98 . 20 Sec. 17. Section 232.147, subsection 4, paragraph i, Code 21 2025, is amended to read as follows: 22 i. The statistical analysis center for the purposes stated 23 in section 216A.136 8.98 . 24 Sec. 18. Section 232.149, subsection 5, paragraph f, Code 25 2025, is amended to read as follows: 26 f. The statistical analysis center for the purposes stated 27 in section 216A.136 8.98 . 28 Sec. 19. Section 232.149A, subsection 3, paragraph m, Code 29 2025, is amended to read as follows: 30 m. The statistical analysis center for the purposes stated 31 in section 216A.136 8.98 . 32 Sec. 20. REPEAL. Sections 216A.136, 216A.137, and 33 216A.138, Code 2025, are repealed. 34 Sec. 21. APPLICABILITY. The following apply to contracts 35 -12- LSB 1362HV (2) 91 sc/ns 12/ 15 H.F. 756 entered into or renewed on or after the effective date of this 1 Act: 2 1. The section of this Act enacting section 8.94. 3 2. The section of this Act enacting section 8.95. 4 3. The section of this Act enacting section 8.96. 5 EXPLANATION 6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 7 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 8 This bill relates to matters under the purview of the 9 department of management (DOM). 10 Under current law, the governorâs budget recommendation is 11 considered confidential by the legislative services agency 12 until it is made public by the governor. The bill states that 13 information transmitted by state entities to DOM for developing 14 the budget as required by law, and documents based on the 15 transmittals, are confidential until the governor transmits the 16 budget to the general assembly. 17 The bill strikes current law providing for the use of moneys 18 in the technology reinvestment fund for certain technology 19 projects and instead appropriates moneys in the fund to DOM for 20 technology projects using factors set forth in the bill. The 21 bill requires DOM to provide a prioritized list of proposed 22 projects to the governor, who must use the list to develop 23 a budgetary recommendation to the general assembly, and to 24 report completed and ongoing projects to the general assembly 25 annually. 26 The bill increases the frequency at which a person 27 performing work for DOM or an individual on the information 28 technology staff of a supported entity may be subject to a 29 national criminal history check through the federal bureau of 30 investigation from at least once every 10 years to every 5 31 years. 32 The bill prohibits the inclusion of certain provisions in 33 information technology contracts and declares those provisions 34 void if present in such contracts. The bill also provides that 35 -13- LSB 1362HV (2) 91 sc/ns 13/ 15 H.F. 756 such contracts are deemed to include provisions requiring the 1 contract to be governed by Iowa law and litigation related to 2 the contract to be brought and maintained in an appropriate 3 state or federal court sitting in Iowa. The bill authorizes 4 the director of DOM to include limitations of vendor liability 5 in information technology goods and services contracts, but 6 sets forth prohibited terms in such limitations of liability. 7 The bill makes all communication concerning cybersecurity 8 between the chief information security officer and other 9 entities confidential and allows the communications to be 10 released only for specific purposes. 11 Under current law, the department of health and human 12 services serves as the Iowa statistical analysis center and 13 maintains an integrated information system for data sharing 14 among federal, state, and local governments. The bill 15 transfers these powers and duties to DOM and grants DOM access 16 to criminal justice information other than intelligence data 17 and peace officer investigative reports maintained by the 18 department of public safety. DOM is authorized to provide 19 data analysis and reporting on issues that may affect the 20 stateâs correctional population and various subgroups of the 21 population, to maintain a multiagency information system to 22 track the progress of juveniles and adults charged with a 23 criminal offense through state and local agencies and programs, 24 and to count and track decision points for individuals in 25 the juvenile justice system, child welfare system, and 26 court system. If DOM lacks sufficient moneys to perform the 27 authorized tasks of the Iowa statistical analysis center, the 28 bill allows DOM to determine which, if any, to implement. 29 The bill states that DOM is not the lawful custodian under 30 Code chapter 22 (open records) for records DOM maintains in 31 DOMâs information technology capacity for other state entities 32 as an automated data processing unit of government or when 33 held by DOM solely for storage for another department or 34 establishment. The bill requires DOM to deny requests for 35 -14- LSB 1362HV (2) 91 sc/ns 14/ 15 H.F. 756 information for which DOM is not the lawful custodian, to 1 provide assistance to the lawful custodian to comply with 2 production obligations, and to cooperate in any efforts to 3 resist associated subpoenas. 4 -15- LSB 1362HV (2) 91 sc/ns 15/ 15
