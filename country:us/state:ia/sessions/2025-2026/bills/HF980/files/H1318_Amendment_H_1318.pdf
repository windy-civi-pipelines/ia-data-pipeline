1 Amend House File 980 as follows:
2 1. Page 1, after line 19 by inserting:
3 <Sec. ___. Section 96.3, subsection 5, paragraph a, Code
4 2025, is amended to read as follows:
5 a. Duration of benefits. The maximum total amount of
6 benefits payable to an eligible individual during a benefit
7 year shall not exceed the total of the wage credits accrued to
8 the individual’s account during the individual’s base period,
9 or sixteen twenty-six times the individual’s weekly benefit
10 amount, whichever is the lesser. The director shall maintain
11 a separate account for each individual who earns wages in
12 insured work. The director shall compute wage credits for
13 each individual by crediting the individual’s account with
14 one-third of the wages for insured work paid to the individual
15 during the individual’s base period. However, the director
16 shall recompute wage credits for an individual who is laid
17 off due to the individual’s employer going out of business at
18 the factory, establishment, or other premises at which the
19 individual was last employed, by crediting the individual’s
20 account with one-half, instead of one-third, of the wages for
21 insured work paid to the individual during the individual’s
22 base period. Benefits paid to an eligible individual shall
23 be charged against the base period wage credits in the
24 individual’s account which have not been previously charged,
25 in the inverse chronological order as the wages on which the
26 wage credits are based were paid. However if the state “off”
27 indicator is in effect and if the individual is laid off due to
28 the individual’s employer going out of business at the factory,
29 establishment, or other premises at which the individual was
30 last employed, the maximum benefits payable shall be extended
31 to twenty-six thirty-nine times the individual’s weekly benefit
32 amount, but not to exceed the total of the wage credits accrued
33 to the individual’s account.>
34 2. Title page, line 1, by striking <taxes on employers>
35 3. By renumbering as necessary.
