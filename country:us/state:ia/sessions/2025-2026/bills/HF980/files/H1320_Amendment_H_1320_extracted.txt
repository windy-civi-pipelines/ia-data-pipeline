14 in subparagraph (1) shall be increased in a calendar year if
15 the average statewide seasonally adjusted unemployment rate,
16 as determined by the federal bureau of labor statistics, for
17 the previous calendar year was greater than four percent. The

19 amount for each percentage point, rounded to the nearest whole
20 percentage point, above four percent of the average statewide
21 seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for the previous calendar
22 year. Any annual increase in a multiple of an individual’s
23 benefit amount under this subparagraph shall be for the
24 applicable calendar year only and shall not be cumulative.>
