The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located. b. Only the home state shall have the power to take adverse action against a licenseeâs home state license. c. For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a member state as it would if the conduct had House File 532, p. 10 occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action. d. The home state shall complete any pending investigations of a licensee who changes home states during the course of the investigations. The home state shall also have authority to take appropriate action and shall promptly report the conclusions of the investigations to the administrator of the data system. The administrator of the data system shall promptly notify the new home state of any adverse actions. e. A member state, if otherwise permitted by state law, may recover from the affected licensee the costs of investigations and dispositions of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that licensee. f. A member state may take adverse action based on the factual findings of another remote state, provided that the member state follows its own procedures for taking the adverse action. g. Joint investigations.

All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a licensee shall include a statement that the licenseeâs compact privileges are revoked in all member states during the pendency of the order. i. Once an encumbered license in the home state is restored to an unencumbered license, as certified by the home stateâs licensing authority, the licensee must meet the requirements of subsection 4, paragraph âaâ , and follow the administrative requirements to reapply to obtain a compact privilege in any remote state. House File 532, p. 11 j. If a member state takes adverse action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the data system. The administrator of the data system shall promptly notify the other member states of any adverse actions. k.

The rules of the compact commission shall have the force of law in each member state, provided, however, that where the rules conflict with the laws or regulations of a member state that relate to the procedures, actions, and processes a licensed dietitian is permitted to undertake in that state and the circumstances under which they may do so, as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the compact commission shall be ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict. c. The compact commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this section and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding on the day following adoption or as of the date specified in the rule or amendment, whichever is later. d. If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule or portion of a rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact within four years of the date of adoption of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any member state. e. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the compact commission. f. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the compact commission shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments. House File 532, p. 21 g. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the compact commission, and at least thirty days in advance of the meeting at which the compact commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed rule, the compact commission shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking as follows: (1) On the internet site of the compact commission or other publicly accessible platform. (2) To persons who have requested notice of the compact commissionâs notices of proposed rulemaking. (3) In such other way as the compact commission may by rule specify. h. The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include all of the following: (1) The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the compact commission will hear public comments on the proposed rule and, if different, the time, date, and location of the meeting where the compact commission will consider and vote on the proposed rule. (2) If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or other means of communication, the compact commission shall include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice of proposed rulemaking. (3) The text of the proposed rule and the reason therefore. (4) A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person. (5) The manner in which interested persons may submit written comments. i. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all written comments and documents received by the compact commission in response to the proposed rule shall be available to the public. j. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the compact commission at hearings required by this section. k. The compact commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule. (1) The compact commission may adopt changes to the proposed House File 532, p. 22 rule provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule. (2) The compact commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters. (3) The compact commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in paragraph âlâ , the effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than thirty days after issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the rule. l. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the compact commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule with twenty-four hoursâ notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the compact and in this subsection shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to do any of the following: (1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare. (2) Prevent a loss of compact commission or member state funds. (3) Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established by federal law or rule. (4) Protect public health and safety. m. The compact commission or an authorized committee of the compact commission may direct revision to a previously adopted rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revision shall be posted on the internet site of the compact commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the compact commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without House File 532, p. 23 further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the compact commission. n. No member stateâs rulemaking requirements shall apply under this compact. 11. Oversight, dispute resolution, and enforcement. a. Oversight. (1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement this compact. (2) Except as otherwise provided in this compact, venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the compact commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the compact commission is located. The compact commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter. (3) The compact commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the compact commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the compact commission, this compact, or promulgated rules. b. Default, technical assistance, and termination. (1) If the compact commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the compact commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the compact commission may take and shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the default. (2) The compact commission shall provide a copy of the House File 532, p. 24 notice of default to the other member states. c. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default. d. Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the compact commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting stateâs legislature, the defaulting stateâs licensing authority, and each of the member statesâ licensing authority. e. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination. f. Upon the termination of a stateâs membership from this compact, that state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state of such termination. The terminated state shall continue to recognize all compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of six months after the date of said notice of termination. g. The compact commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the compact commission and the defaulting state. h. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the compact commission by petitioning the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. i. Dispute resolution. (1) Upon request by a member state, the compact commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that House File 532, p. 25 arise among member states and between member and nonmember states. (2) The compact commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate. j. Enforcement. (1) By supermajority vote, the compact commission may initiate legal action against a member state in default in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the compact commission. The compact commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting member stateâs law. (2) A member state may initiate legal action against the compact commission in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. (3) No party other than a member state shall enforce this compact against the compact commission. 12. Effective date, withdrawal, and amendment. a. The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state. (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the compact commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the charter member states to determine if the statute enacted by each such charter member state is materially different than the model compact statute. House File 532, p. 26 (a) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model compact statute shall be entitled to the default process set forth in subsection 11. (b) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is terminated, or withdraws from the compact, the compact commission shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if the number of member states should be less than seven. (2) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven initial charter member states shall be subject to the process set forth in subsection 8, paragraph âcâ , subparagraph (21), to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in the compact. (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the compact commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the compact commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the compact commission unless specifically repudiated by the compact commission. (4) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the compact commissionâs initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the compact commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state. b. Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the compact. (1) A member stateâs withdrawal shall not take effect until one hundred eighty days after enactment of the repealing statute. (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing stateâs licensing authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal. (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Notwithstanding House File 532, p. 27 any subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of one hundred eighty days after the date of such notice of withdrawal. c. Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact. d. This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states. 13. Construction and severability. a. This compact and the compact commissionâs rulemaking authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit the compact commissionâs rulemaking authority solely for those purposes. b. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. c. Notwithstanding paragraph âbâ , the compact commission may deny a stateâs participation in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of subsection 11, paragraph âbâ , terminate a member stateâs participation in the compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any House File 532, p. 28 member state, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters. 14. Consistent effect and conflict with other state laws. a. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the compact. b. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a member state in conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict. c. All permissible agreements between the compact commission and the member states are binding in accordance with their terms. ______________________________ PAT GRASSLEY Speaker of the House ______________________________ AMY SINCLAIR President of the Senate I hereby certify that this bill originated in the House and is known as House File 532, Ninety-first General Assembly. ______________________________ MEGHAN NELSON Chief Clerk of the House Approved _______________, 2025 ______________________________ KIM REYNOLDS Governor

If a licensee changes their state of residence by moving House File 532, p. 9 from a member state to a nonmember state, or from a nonmember state to a member state, the state criteria shall apply for issuance of a single state license in the new state. d. Nothing in this compact shall interfere with a licenseeâs ability to hold a single state license in multiple states; however, for the purposes of this compact, a licensee shall have only one home state license. e. Nothing in this compact shall affect the requirements established by a member state for the issuance of a single state license. 6. Active military members or their spouses. An active military member, or the active military memberâs spouse, shall designate a home state where the individual has a current license in good standing.

In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a remote state shall have the authority, in accordance with existing state due process law, to do all of the following: (1) Take adverse action against a licenseeâs compact privilege within that member state. (2) Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses as well as the production of evidence.

The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located. b. Only the home state shall have the power to take adverse action against a licenseeâs home state license. c. For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a member state as it would if the conduct had House File 532, p. 10 occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action. d. The home state shall complete any pending investigations of a licensee who changes home states during the course of the investigations. The home state shall also have authority to take appropriate action and shall promptly report the conclusions of the investigations to the administrator of the data system. The administrator of the data system shall promptly notify the new home state of any adverse actions. e. A member state, if otherwise permitted by state law, may recover from the affected licensee the costs of investigations and dispositions of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that licensee. f. A member state may take adverse action based on the factual findings of another remote state, provided that the member state follows its own procedures for taking the adverse action. g. Joint investigations. (1) In addition to the authority granted to a member state by its respective state law, any member state may participate with other member states in joint investigations of licensees. (2) Member states shall share any investigative, litigation, or compliance materials in furtherance of any joint investigation initiated under the compact. h. If adverse action is taken by the home state against a licenseeâs home state license resulting in an encumbrance on the home state license, the licenseeâs compact privilege in all other member states shall be revoked until all encumbrances have been removed from the home state license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a licensee shall include a statement that the licenseeâs compact privileges are revoked in all member states during the pendency of the order. i. Once an encumbered license in the home state is restored to an unencumbered license, as certified by the home stateâs licensing authority, the licensee must meet the requirements of subsection 4, paragraph âaâ , and follow the administrative requirements to reapply to obtain a compact privilege in any remote state. House File 532, p. 11 j. If a member state takes adverse action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the data system. The administrator of the data system shall promptly notify the other member states of any adverse actions. k. Nothing in this compact shall override a member stateâs decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action. 8. Establishment of the dietitian licensure compact commission. a. The compact member states hereby create and establish a joint government agency whose membership consists of all member states that have enacted the compact known as the dietitian licensure compact commission. The compact commission is an instrumentality of the compact states acting jointly and not an instrumentality of any one state. The compact commission shall come into existence on or after the effective date of the compact as set forth in subsection 12. b. Membership, voting, and meetings.

Rulemaking. a. The compact commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule shall be invalid and have no force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because the compact commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review. b. The rules of the compact commission shall have the force of law in each member state, provided, however, that where the rules conflict with the laws or regulations of a member state that relate to the procedures, actions, and processes a licensed dietitian is permitted to undertake in that state and the circumstances under which they may do so, as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the compact commission shall be ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict. c. The compact commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this section and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding on the day following adoption or as of the date specified in the rule or amendment, whichever is later. d. If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule or portion of a rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact within four years of the date of adoption of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any member state. e. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the compact commission. f. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the compact commission shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments. House File 532, p. 21 g. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the compact commission, and at least thirty days in advance of the meeting at which the compact commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed rule, the compact commission shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking as follows: (1) On the internet site of the compact commission or other publicly accessible platform. (2) To persons who have requested notice of the compact commissionâs notices of proposed rulemaking. (3) In such other way as the compact commission may by rule specify. h. The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include all of the following: (1) The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the compact commission will hear public comments on the proposed rule and, if different, the time, date, and location of the meeting where the compact commission will consider and vote on the proposed rule. (2) If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or other means of communication, the compact commission shall include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice of proposed rulemaking. (3) The text of the proposed rule and the reason therefore. (4) A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person. (5) The manner in which interested persons may submit written comments. i. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all written comments and documents received by the compact commission in response to the proposed rule shall be available to the public. j. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the compact commission at hearings required by this section. k. The compact commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule. (1) The compact commission may adopt changes to the proposed House File 532, p. 22 rule provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule. (2) The compact commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters. (3) The compact commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in paragraph âlâ , the effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than thirty days after issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the rule. l. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the compact commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule with twenty-four hoursâ notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the compact and in this subsection shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to do any of the following: (1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare. (2) Prevent a loss of compact commission or member state funds. (3) Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established by federal law or rule. (4) Protect public health and safety. m. The compact commission or an authorized committee of the compact commission may direct revision to a previously adopted rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revision shall be posted on the internet site of the compact commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the compact commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without House File 532, p. 23 further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the compact commission. n. No member stateâs rulemaking requirements shall apply under this compact. 11. Oversight, dispute resolution, and enforcement. a. Oversight. (1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement this compact. (2) Except as otherwise provided in this compact, venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the compact commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the compact commission is located. The compact commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter. (3) The compact commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the compact commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the compact commission, this compact, or promulgated rules. b. Default, technical assistance, and termination. (1) If the compact commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the compact commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the compact commission may take and shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the default. (2) The compact commission shall provide a copy of the House File 532, p. 24 notice of default to the other member states. c. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default. d. Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the compact commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting stateâs legislature, the defaulting stateâs licensing authority, and each of the member statesâ licensing authority. e. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination. f. Upon the termination of a stateâs membership from this compact, that state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state of such termination. The terminated state shall continue to recognize all compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of six months after the date of said notice of termination. g. The compact commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the compact commission and the defaulting state. h. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the compact commission by petitioning the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. i. Dispute resolution. (1) Upon request by a member state, the compact commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that House File 532, p. 25 arise among member states and between member and nonmember states. (2) The compact commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate. j. Enforcement. (1) By supermajority vote, the compact commission may initiate legal action against a member state in default in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the compact commission. The compact commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting member stateâs law. (2) A member state may initiate legal action against the compact commission in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. (3) No party other than a member state shall enforce this compact against the compact commission. 12. Effective date, withdrawal, and amendment. a. The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state. (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the compact commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the charter member states to determine if the statute enacted by each such charter member state is materially different than the model compact statute. House File 532, p. 26 (a) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model compact statute shall be entitled to the default process set forth in subsection 11. (b) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is terminated, or withdraws from the compact, the compact commission shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if the number of member states should be less than seven. (2) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven initial charter member states shall be subject to the process set forth in subsection 8, paragraph âcâ , subparagraph (21), to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in the compact. (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the compact commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the compact commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the compact commission unless specifically repudiated by the compact commission. (4) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the compact commissionâs initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the compact commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state. b. Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the compact. (1) A member stateâs withdrawal shall not take effect until one hundred eighty days after enactment of the repealing statute. (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing stateâs licensing authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal. (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Notwithstanding House File 532, p. 27 any subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of one hundred eighty days after the date of such notice of withdrawal. c. Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact. d. This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states. 13. Construction and severability. a. This compact and the compact commissionâs rulemaking authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit the compact commissionâs rulemaking authority solely for those purposes. b. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. c. Notwithstanding paragraph âbâ , the compact commission may deny a stateâs participation in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of subsection 11, paragraph âbâ , terminate a member stateâs participation in the compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any House File 532, p. 28 member state, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters. 14. Consistent effect and conflict with other state laws. a. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the compact. b. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a member state in conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict. c. All permissible agreements between the compact commission and the member states are binding in accordance with their terms. ______________________________ PAT GRASSLEY Speaker of the House ______________________________ AMY SINCLAIR President of the Senate I hereby certify that this bill originated in the House and is known as House File 532, Ninety-first General Assembly. ______________________________ MEGHAN NELSON Chief Clerk of the House Approved _______________, 2025 ______________________________ KIM REYNOLDS Governor
