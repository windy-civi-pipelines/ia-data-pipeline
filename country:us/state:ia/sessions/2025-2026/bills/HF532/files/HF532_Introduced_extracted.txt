In so doing, the home state 19 shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action. 20 d. The home state shall complete any pending investigations 21 of a licensee who changes home states during the course of 22 the investigations.

If adverse action is taken by the home state against a 8 licenseeâs home state license resulting in an encumbrance on 9 the home state license, the licenseeâs compact privilege in all 10 other member states shall be revoked until all encumbrances 11 have been removed from the home state license. All home state 12 disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a 13 licensee shall include a statement that the licenseeâs compact 14 privileges are revoked in all member states during the pendency 15 of the order. 16 i. Once an encumbered license in the home state is restored 17 to an unencumbered license, as certified by the home stateâs 18 licensing authority, the licensee must meet the requirements 19 of subsection 4, paragraph âaâ , and follow the administrative 20 requirements to reapply to obtain a compact privilege in any 21 remote state. 22 j. If a member state takes adverse action, it shall promptly 23 notify the administrator of the data system. The administrator 24 of the data system shall promptly notify the other member 25 states of any adverse actions. 26 k.

The procurement 5 of insurance of any type by the compact commission shall not in 6 any way compromise or limit the immunity granted hereunder. 7 (2) The compact commission shall defend any member, 8 officer, executive director, employee, and representative of 9 the compact commission in any civil action seeking to impose 10 liability arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or 11 omission that occurred within the scope of compact commission 12 employment, duties, or responsibilities, or as determined 13 by the compact commission that the person against whom the 14 claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred 15 within the scope of compact commission employment, duties, 16 or responsibilities, provided that nothing herein shall be 17 construed to prohibit that person from retaining their own 18 counsel at their own expense, and provided further that the 19 actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from 20 that personâs intentional or willful or wanton misconduct. 21 (3) The compact commission shall indemnify and hold 22 harmless any member, officer, executive director, employee, and 23 representative of the compact commission for the amount of any 24 settlement or judgment obtained against that person arising out 25 of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred 26 within the scope of compact commission employment, duties, or 27 responsibilities, or that such person had a reasonable basis 28 for believing occurred within the scope of compact commission 29 employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the 30 actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from 31 the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that person. 32 (4) Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on 33 the liability of any licensee for professional malpractice 34 or misconduct, which shall be governed solely by any other 35 -19- LSB 1080HV (1) 91 ss/ko 19/ 31 H.F. 532 applicable state laws. 1 (5) Nothing in this compact shall be interpreted to waive 2 or otherwise abrogate a member stateâs state action immunity 3 or state action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust 4 claims under the federal Sherman Act, federal Clayton Act, or 5 any other state or federal antitrust or anticompetitive law or 6 regulation. 7 (6) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to be a 8 waiver of sovereign immunity by the member states or by the 9 compact commission. 10 9. Data system. 11 a. The compact commission shall provide for the development, 12 maintenance, operation, and utilization of a coordinated data 13 system. 14 b.

The records and information provided to a member state 3 pursuant to this compact or through the data system, when 4 certified by the compact commission or an agent thereof, 5 shall constitute the authenticated business records of the 6 compact commission, and shall be entitled to any associated 7 hearsay exception in any relevant judicial, quasi-judicial, or 8 administrative proceedings in a member state. 9 e. Current significant investigative information pertaining 10 to a licensee in any member state will only be available to 11 other member states. 12 f. It is the responsibility of the member states to report 13 any adverse action against a licensee and to monitor the data 14 system to determine whether any adverse action has been taken 15 against a licensee. Adverse action information pertaining to 16 a licensee in any member state will be available to any other 17 member state. 18 g.

Rulemaking. 27 a. The compact commission shall promulgate reasonable 28 rules in order to effectively and efficiently implement and 29 administer the purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule 30 shall be invalid and have no force or effect only if a court of 31 competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because 32 the compact commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a 33 manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or 34 the powers granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable 35 -21- LSB 1080HV (1) 91 ss/ko 21/ 31 H.F. 532 standard of review. 1 b. The rules of the compact commission shall have the force 2 of law in each member state, provided, however, that where 3 the rules conflict with the laws or regulations of a member 4 state that relate to the procedures, actions, and processes 5 a licensed dietitian is permitted to undertake in that state 6 and the circumstances under which they may do so, as held by 7 a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the compact 8 commission shall be ineffective in that state to the extent of 9 the conflict. 10 c. The compact commission shall exercise its rulemaking 11 powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this section and 12 the rules adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding on 13 the day following adoption or as of the date specified in the 14 rule or amendment, whichever is later. 15 d. If a majority of the legislatures of the member states 16 rejects a rule or portion of a rule, by enactment of a statute 17 or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact 18 within four years of the date of adoption of the rule, then 19 such rule shall have no further force and effect in any member 20 state. 21 e. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of 22 the compact commission. 23 f. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the compact 24 commission shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to 25 provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and 26 arguments. 27 g.

The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include all of 4 the following: 5 (1) The time, date, and location of the public hearing at 6 which the compact commission will hear public comments on the 7 proposed rule and, if different, the time, date, and location 8 of the meeting where the compact commission will consider and 9 vote on the proposed rule. 10 (2) If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video 11 conference, or other means of communication, the compact 12 commission shall include the mechanism for access to the 13 hearing in the notice of proposed rulemaking. 14 (3) The text of the proposed rule and the reason therefore. 15 (4) A request for comments on the proposed rule from any 16 interested person. 17 (5) The manner in which interested persons may submit 18 written comments. 19 i. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording 20 and all written comments and documents received by the compact 21 commission in response to the proposed rule shall be available 22 to the public. 23 j. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as 24 requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be 25 grouped for the convenience of the compact commission at 26 hearings required by this section. 27 k. The compact commission shall, by majority vote of all 28 members, take final action on the proposed rule based on the 29 rulemaking record and the full text of the rule. 30 (1) The compact commission may adopt changes to the proposed 31 rule provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose 32 of the proposed rule. 33 (2) The compact commission shall provide an explanation of 34 the reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed rule 35 -23- LSB 1080HV (1) 91 ss/ko 23/ 31 H.F. 532 as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were 1 recommended by commenters. 2 (3) The compact commission shall determine a reasonable 3 effective date for the rule. Except for an emergency as 4 provided in paragraph âlâ , the effective date of the rule shall 5 be no sooner than thirty days after issuing the notice that it 6 adopted or amended the rule. 7 l. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the 8 compact commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule 9 with twenty-four hoursâ notice, with opportunity to comment, 10 provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the 11 compact and in this subsection shall be retroactively applied 12 to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later 13 than ninety days after the effective date of the rule. For the 14 purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must 15 be adopted immediately in order to do any of the following: 16 (1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or 17 welfare. 18 (2) Prevent a loss of compact commission or member state 19 funds. 20 (3) Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is 21 established by federal law or rule. 22 (4) Protect public health and safety. 23 m. The compact commission or an authorized committee of 24 the compact commission may direct revision to a previously 25 adopted rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, 26 errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical 27 errors. Public notice of any revision shall be posted on the 28 internet site of the compact commission. The revision shall 29 be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty 30 days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on 31 grounds that the revision results in a material change to a 32 rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to 33 the compact commission prior to the end of the notice period. 34 If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without 35 -24- LSB 1080HV (1) 91 ss/ko 24/ 31 H.F. 532 further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision 1 may not take effect without the approval of the compact 2 commission. 3 n. No member stateâs rulemaking requirements shall apply 4 under this compact. 5 11. Oversight, dispute resolution, and enforcement. 6 a. Oversight. 7 (1) The executive and judicial branches of state government 8 in each member state shall enforce this compact and take all 9 actions necessary and appropriate to implement this compact. 10 (2) Except as otherwise provided in this compact, venue 11 is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the compact 12 commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court 13 of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the 14 compact commission is located. The compact commission may 15 waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it 16 adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute 17 resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit 18 the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a 19 licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such 20 similar matter. 21 (3) The compact commission shall be entitled to receive 22 service of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement 23 or interpretation of the compact and shall have standing to 24 intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to 25 provide the compact commission service of process shall render 26 a judgment or order void as to the compact commission, this 27 compact, or promulgated rules. 28 b. Default, technical assistance, and termination. 29 (1) If the compact commission determines that a member 30 state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or 31 responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, 32 the compact commission shall provide written notice to the 33 defaulting state. The notice of default shall describe the 34 default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any 35 -25- LSB 1080HV (1) 91 ss/ko 25/ 31 H.F. 532 other action that the compact commission may take and shall 1 offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the 2 default. 3 (2) The compact commission shall provide a copy of the 4 notice of default to the other member states. 5 c. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the 6 defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an 7 affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member 8 states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on 9 that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective 10 date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve 11 the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred 12 during the period of default. 13 d. Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed 14 only after all other means of securing compliance have been 15 exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be 16 given by the compact commission to the governor, the majority 17 and minority leaders of the defaulting stateâs legislature, the 18 defaulting stateâs licensing authority, and each of the member 19 statesâ licensing authority. 20 e. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all 21 assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through 22 the effective date of termination, including obligations that 23 extend beyond the effective date of termination. 24 f. Upon the termination of a stateâs membership from 25 this compact, that state shall immediately provide notice to 26 all licensees within that state of such termination. The 27 terminated state shall continue to recognize all compact 28 privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 29 six months after the date of said notice of termination. 30 g. The compact commission shall not bear any costs related 31 to a state that is found to be in default or that has been 32 terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing 33 between the compact commission and the defaulting state. 34 h. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the compact 35 -26- LSB 1080HV (1) 91 ss/ko 26/ 31 H.F. 532 commission by petitioning the United States district court for 1 the District of Columbia or the federal district where the 2 compact commission has its principal offices. The prevailing 3 party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including 4 reasonable attorney fees. 5 i. Dispute resolution. 6 (1) Upon request by a member state, the compact commission 7 shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that 8 arise among member states and between member and nonmember 9 states. 10 (2) The compact commission shall promulgate a rule 11 providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for 12 disputes as appropriate. 13 j. Enforcement. 14 (1) By supermajority vote, the compact commission may 15 initiate legal action against a member state in default in 16 the United States district court for the District of Columbia 17 or the federal district where the compact commission has its 18 principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions 19 of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought 20 may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event 21 judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall 22 be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable 23 attorney fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive 24 remedies of the compact commission. The compact commission 25 may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the 26 defaulting member stateâs law. 27 (2) A member state may initiate legal action against the 28 compact commission in the United States district court for the 29 District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact 30 commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with 31 the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The 32 relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. 33 In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing 34 party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including 35 -27- LSB 1080HV (1) 91 ss/ko 27/ 31 H.F. 532 reasonable attorney fees. 1 (3) No party other than a member state shall enforce this 2 compact against the compact commission. 3 12. Effective date, withdrawal, and amendment. 4 a. The compact shall come into effect on the date on which 5 the compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh member 6 state. 7 (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the 8 compact commission shall convene and review the enactment of 9 each of the charter member states to determine if the statute 10 enacted by each such charter member state is materially 11 different than the model compact statute. 12 (a) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be 13 materially different from the model compact statute shall be 14 entitled to the default process set forth in subsection 11. 15 (b) If any member state is later found to be in default, 16 or is terminated, or withdraws from the compact, the compact 17 commission shall remain in existence and the compact shall 18 remain in effect even if the number of member states should be 19 less than seven. 20 (2) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the 21 seven initial charter member states shall be subject to the 22 process set forth in subsection 8, paragraph âcâ , subparagraph 23 (21), to determine if their enactments are materially different 24 from the model compact statute and whether they qualify for 25 participation in the compact. 26 (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the compact 27 commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the 28 administration of the compact prior to the effective date of 29 the compact or the compact commission coming into existence 30 shall be considered to be actions of the compact commission 31 unless specifically repudiated by the compact commission. 32 (4) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the 33 compact commissionâs initial adoption of the rules and bylaws 34 shall be subject to the rules and bylaws as they exist on the 35 -28- LSB 1080HV (1) 91 ss/ko 28/ 31 H.F. 532 date on which the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule 1 that has been previously adopted by the compact commission 2 shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the 3 compact becomes law in that state. 4 b. Any member state may withdraw from this compact by 5 enacting a statute repealing the compact. 6 (1) A member stateâs withdrawal shall not take effect 7 until one hundred eighty days after enactment of the repealing 8 statute. 9 (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement 10 of the withdrawing stateâs licensing authority to comply with 11 the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of 12 this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal. 13 (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this 14 compact, a state shall immediately provide notice of such 15 withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Notwithstanding 16 any subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such 17 withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all compact 18 privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum 19 of one hundred eighty days after the date of such notice of 20 withdrawal. 21 c. Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed 22 to invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other 23 cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember 24 state that does not conflict with the provisions of this 25 compact. 26 d. This compact may be amended by the member states. No 27 amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding 28 upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all 29 member states. 30 13. Construction and severability. 31 a. This compact and the compact commissionâs rulemaking 32 authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate 33 the purposes and the implementation and administration of the 34 compact. Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or 35 -29- LSB 1080HV (1) 91 ss/ko 29/ 31 H.F. 532 requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to 1 limit the compact commissionâs rulemaking authority solely for 2 those purposes. 3 b. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and 4 if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact 5 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary 6 to the constitution of any member state, a state seeking 7 participation in the compact, or of the United States, or 8 the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, 9 or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of 10 competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this 11 compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, 12 agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. 13 c. Notwithstanding paragraph âbâ , the compact commission may 14 deny a stateâs participation in the compact or, in accordance 15 with the requirements of subsection 11, paragraph âbâ , 16 terminate a member stateâs participation in the compact, if it 17 determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state 18 is a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this 19 compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any 20 member state, the compact shall remain in full force and effect 21 as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect 22 as to the member state affected as to all severable matters. 23 14. Consistent effect and conflict with other state laws. 24 a. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement 25 of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent 26 with the compact. 27 b. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal 28 requirements in a member state in conflict with the compact are 29 superseded to the extent of the conflict. 30 c. All permissible agreements between the compact commission 31 and the member states are binding in accordance with their 32 terms. 33 EXPLANATION 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 35 -30- LSB 1080HV (1) 91 ss/ko 30/ 31 H.F. 532 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 1 This bill establishes the dietitian licensure compact. 2 The compact establishes a system whereby a dietitian 3 licensed to practice in one member state may practice in 4 another member state under a multistate license without 5 applying for a license in that state. The compact imposes 6 certain minimum requirements on the licensure of dietitians in 7 member states. 8 The compact creates a commission to administer the operation 9 of the compact. The commission is an instrumentality of the 10 member states. The compact includes provisions relating to the 11 establishment and membership of the commission; powers of the 12 commission, meetings and voting requirements of the commission; 13 commission bylaws and rules; commission committees; commission 14 finances; the establishment of a licensure data system; 15 oversight by member states; compacting state compliance; 16 venue for judicial proceedings; defense and indemnification; 17 effective dates and amendments to the compact; withdrawal, 18 default, and expulsion; severability and construction; and the 19 binding effect of the compact and other laws. 20 The compact becomes effective upon the adoption of the 21 compact by the seventh participating state. 22 -31- LSB 1080HV (1) 91 ss/ko 31/ 31

All home state 12 disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a 13 licensee shall include a statement that the licenseeâs compact 14 privileges are revoked in all member states during the pendency 15 of the order. 16 i.

If a member state takes adverse action, it shall promptly 23 notify the administrator of the data system. The administrator 24 of the data system shall promptly notify the other member 25 states of any adverse actions. 26 k.

The aggregate annual assessment 10 amount for member states shall be allocated based upon a 11 formula that the compact commission shall promulgate by rule. 12 (4) The compact commission shall not incur obligations of 13 any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same, 14 nor shall the compact commission pledge the credit of any of 15 the member states, except by and with the authority of the 16 member state. 17 (5) The compact commission shall keep accurate accounts of 18 all receipts and disbursements.

The procurement 5 of insurance of any type by the compact commission shall not in 6 any way compromise or limit the immunity granted hereunder. 7 (2) The compact commission shall defend any member, 8 officer, executive director, employee, and representative of 9 the compact commission in any civil action seeking to impose 10 liability arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or 11 omission that occurred within the scope of compact commission 12 employment, duties, or responsibilities, or as determined 13 by the compact commission that the person against whom the 14 claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred 15 within the scope of compact commission employment, duties, 16 or responsibilities, provided that nothing herein shall be 17 construed to prohibit that person from retaining their own 18 counsel at their own expense, and provided further that the 19 actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from 20 that personâs intentional or willful or wanton misconduct. 21 (3) The compact commission shall indemnify and hold 22 harmless any member, officer, executive director, employee, and 23 representative of the compact commission for the amount of any 24 settlement or judgment obtained against that person arising out 25 of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred 26 within the scope of compact commission employment, duties, or 27 responsibilities, or that such person had a reasonable basis 28 for believing occurred within the scope of compact commission 29 employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the 30 actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from 31 the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that person. 32 (4) Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on 33 the liability of any licensee for professional malpractice 34 or misconduct, which shall be governed solely by any other 35 -19- LSB 1080HV (1) 91 ss/ko 19/ 31 H.F. 532 applicable state laws. 1 (5) Nothing in this compact shall be interpreted to waive 2 or otherwise abrogate a member stateâs state action immunity 3 or state action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust 4 claims under the federal Sherman Act, federal Clayton Act, or 5 any other state or federal antitrust or anticompetitive law or 6 regulation. 7 (6) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to be a 8 waiver of sovereign immunity by the member states or by the 9 compact commission. 10 9.

The records and information provided to a member state 3 pursuant to this compact or through the data system, when 4 certified by the compact commission or an agent thereof, 5 shall constitute the authenticated business records of the 6 compact commission, and shall be entitled to any associated 7 hearsay exception in any relevant judicial, quasi-judicial, or 8 administrative proceedings in a member state. 9 e. Current significant investigative information pertaining 10 to a licensee in any member state will only be available to 11 other member states. 12 f. It is the responsibility of the member states to report 13 any adverse action against a licensee and to monitor the data 14 system to determine whether any adverse action has been taken 15 against a licensee. Adverse action information pertaining to 16 a licensee in any member state will be available to any other 17 member state. 18 g.

Rulemaking. 27 a. The compact commission shall promulgate reasonable 28 rules in order to effectively and efficiently implement and 29 administer the purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule 30 shall be invalid and have no force or effect only if a court of 31 competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because 32 the compact commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a 33 manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or 34 the powers granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable 35 -21- LSB 1080HV (1) 91 ss/ko 21/ 31 H.F. 532 standard of review. 1 b. The rules of the compact commission shall have the force 2 of law in each member state, provided, however, that where 3 the rules conflict with the laws or regulations of a member 4 state that relate to the procedures, actions, and processes 5 a licensed dietitian is permitted to undertake in that state 6 and the circumstances under which they may do so, as held by 7 a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the compact 8 commission shall be ineffective in that state to the extent of 9 the conflict. 10 c. The compact commission shall exercise its rulemaking 11 powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this section and 12 the rules adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding on 13 the day following adoption or as of the date specified in the 14 rule or amendment, whichever is later. 15 d. If a majority of the legislatures of the member states 16 rejects a rule or portion of a rule, by enactment of a statute 17 or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact 18 within four years of the date of adoption of the rule, then 19 such rule shall have no further force and effect in any member 20 state. 21 e. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of 22 the compact commission. 23 f. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the compact 24 commission shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to 25 provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and 26 arguments. 27 g. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the compact 28 commission, and at least thirty days in advance of the meeting 29 at which the compact commission will hold a public hearing 30 on the proposed rule, the compact commission shall provide a 31 notice of proposed rulemaking as follows: 32 (1) On the internet site of the compact commission or other 33 publicly accessible platform. 34 (2) To persons who have requested notice of the compact 35 -22- LSB 1080HV (1) 91 ss/ko 22/ 31 H.F. 532 commissionâs notices of proposed rulemaking. 1 (3) In such other way as the compact commission may by rule 2 specify. 3 h. The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include all of 4 the following: 5 (1) The time, date, and location of the public hearing at 6 which the compact commission will hear public comments on the 7 proposed rule and, if different, the time, date, and location 8 of the meeting where the compact commission will consider and 9 vote on the proposed rule. 10 (2) If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video 11 conference, or other means of communication, the compact 12 commission shall include the mechanism for access to the 13 hearing in the notice of proposed rulemaking. 14 (3) The text of the proposed rule and the reason therefore. 15 (4) A request for comments on the proposed rule from any 16 interested person. 17 (5) The manner in which interested persons may submit 18 written comments. 19 i. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording 20 and all written comments and documents received by the compact 21 commission in response to the proposed rule shall be available 22 to the public. 23 j. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as 24 requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be 25 grouped for the convenience of the compact commission at 26 hearings required by this section. 27 k. The compact commission shall, by majority vote of all 28 members, take final action on the proposed rule based on the 29 rulemaking record and the full text of the rule. 30 (1) The compact commission may adopt changes to the proposed 31 rule provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose 32 of the proposed rule. 33 (2) The compact commission shall provide an explanation of 34 the reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed rule 35 -23- LSB 1080HV (1) 91 ss/ko 23/ 31 H.F. 532 as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were 1 recommended by commenters. 2 (3) The compact commission shall determine a reasonable 3 effective date for the rule. Except for an emergency as 4 provided in paragraph âlâ , the effective date of the rule shall 5 be no sooner than thirty days after issuing the notice that it 6 adopted or amended the rule. 7 l. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the 8 compact commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule 9 with twenty-four hoursâ notice, with opportunity to comment, 10 provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the 11 compact and in this subsection shall be retroactively applied 12 to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later 13 than ninety days after the effective date of the rule. For the 14 purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must 15 be adopted immediately in order to do any of the following: 16 (1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or 17 welfare. 18 (2) Prevent a loss of compact commission or member state 19 funds. 20 (3) Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is 21 established by federal law or rule. 22 (4) Protect public health and safety. 23 m. The compact commission or an authorized committee of 24 the compact commission may direct revision to a previously 25 adopted rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, 26 errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical 27 errors. Public notice of any revision shall be posted on the 28 internet site of the compact commission. The revision shall 29 be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty 30 days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on 31 grounds that the revision results in a material change to a 32 rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to 33 the compact commission prior to the end of the notice period. 34 If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without 35 -24- LSB 1080HV (1) 91 ss/ko 24/ 31 H.F. 532 further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision 1 may not take effect without the approval of the compact 2 commission. 3 n. No member stateâs rulemaking requirements shall apply 4 under this compact. 5 11. Oversight, dispute resolution, and enforcement. 6 a. Oversight. 7 (1) The executive and judicial branches of state government 8 in each member state shall enforce this compact and take all 9 actions necessary and appropriate to implement this compact. 10 (2) Except as otherwise provided in this compact, venue 11 is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the compact 12 commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court 13 of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the 14 compact commission is located. The compact commission may 15 waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it 16 adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute 17 resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit 18 the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a 19 licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such 20 similar matter. 21 (3) The compact commission shall be entitled to receive 22 service of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement 23 or interpretation of the compact and shall have standing to 24 intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to 25 provide the compact commission service of process shall render 26 a judgment or order void as to the compact commission, this 27 compact, or promulgated rules. 28 b. Default, technical assistance, and termination. 29 (1) If the compact commission determines that a member 30 state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or 31 responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, 32 the compact commission shall provide written notice to the 33 defaulting state. The notice of default shall describe the 34 default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any 35 -25- LSB 1080HV (1) 91 ss/ko 25/ 31 H.F. 532 other action that the compact commission may take and shall 1 offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the 2 default. 3 (2) The compact commission shall provide a copy of the 4 notice of default to the other member states. 5 c. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the 6 defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an 7 affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member 8 states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on 9 that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective 10 date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve 11 the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred 12 during the period of default. 13 d. Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed 14 only after all other means of securing compliance have been 15 exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be 16 given by the compact commission to the governor, the majority 17 and minority leaders of the defaulting stateâs legislature, the 18 defaulting stateâs licensing authority, and each of the member 19 statesâ licensing authority. 20 e. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all 21 assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through 22 the effective date of termination, including obligations that 23 extend beyond the effective date of termination. 24 f. Upon the termination of a stateâs membership from 25 this compact, that state shall immediately provide notice to 26 all licensees within that state of such termination. The 27 terminated state shall continue to recognize all compact 28 privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 29 six months after the date of said notice of termination. 30 g. The compact commission shall not bear any costs related 31 to a state that is found to be in default or that has been 32 terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing 33 between the compact commission and the defaulting state. 34 h. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the compact 35 -26- LSB 1080HV (1) 91 ss/ko 26/ 31 H.F. 532 commission by petitioning the United States district court for 1 the District of Columbia or the federal district where the 2 compact commission has its principal offices. The prevailing 3 party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including 4 reasonable attorney fees. 5 i. Dispute resolution. 6 (1) Upon request by a member state, the compact commission 7 shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that 8 arise among member states and between member and nonmember 9 states. 10 (2) The compact commission shall promulgate a rule 11 providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for 12 disputes as appropriate. 13 j. Enforcement. 14 (1) By supermajority vote, the compact commission may 15 initiate legal action against a member state in default in 16 the United States district court for the District of Columbia 17 or the federal district where the compact commission has its 18 principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions 19 of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought 20 may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event 21 judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall 22 be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable 23 attorney fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive 24 remedies of the compact commission. The compact commission 25 may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the 26 defaulting member stateâs law. 27 (2) A member state may initiate legal action against the 28 compact commission in the United States district court for the 29 District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact 30 commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with 31 the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The 32 relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. 33 In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing 34 party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including 35 -27- LSB 1080HV (1) 91 ss/ko 27/ 31 H.F. 532 reasonable attorney fees. 1 (3) No party other than a member state shall enforce this 2 compact against the compact commission. 3 12. Effective date, withdrawal, and amendment. 4 a. The compact shall come into effect on the date on which 5 the compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh member 6 state. 7 (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the 8 compact commission shall convene and review the enactment of 9 each of the charter member states to determine if the statute 10 enacted by each such charter member state is materially 11 different than the model compact statute. 12 (a) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be 13 materially different from the model compact statute shall be 14 entitled to the default process set forth in subsection 11. 15 (b) If any member state is later found to be in default, 16 or is terminated, or withdraws from the compact, the compact 17 commission shall remain in existence and the compact shall 18 remain in effect even if the number of member states should be 19 less than seven. 20 (2) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the 21 seven initial charter member states shall be subject to the 22 process set forth in subsection 8, paragraph âcâ , subparagraph 23 (21), to determine if their enactments are materially different 24 from the model compact statute and whether they qualify for 25 participation in the compact. 26 (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the compact 27 commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the 28 administration of the compact prior to the effective date of 29 the compact or the compact commission coming into existence 30 shall be considered to be actions of the compact commission 31 unless specifically repudiated by the compact commission. 32 (4) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the 33 compact commissionâs initial adoption of the rules and bylaws 34 shall be subject to the rules and bylaws as they exist on the 35 -28- LSB 1080HV (1) 91 ss/ko 28/ 31 H.F. 532 date on which the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule 1 that has been previously adopted by the compact commission 2 shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the 3 compact becomes law in that state. 4 b. Any member state may withdraw from this compact by 5 enacting a statute repealing the compact. 6 (1) A member stateâs withdrawal shall not take effect 7 until one hundred eighty days after enactment of the repealing 8 statute. 9 (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement 10 of the withdrawing stateâs licensing authority to comply with 11 the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of 12 this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal. 13 (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this 14 compact, a state shall immediately provide notice of such 15 withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Notwithstanding 16 any subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such 17 withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all compact 18 privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum 19 of one hundred eighty days after the date of such notice of 20 withdrawal. 21 c. Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed 22 to invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other 23 cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember 24 state that does not conflict with the provisions of this 25 compact. 26 d. This compact may be amended by the member states. No 27 amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding 28 upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all 29 member states. 30 13. Construction and severability. 31 a. This compact and the compact commissionâs rulemaking 32 authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate 33 the purposes and the implementation and administration of the 34 compact. Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or 35 -29- LSB 1080HV (1) 91 ss/ko 29/ 31 H.F. 532 requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to 1 limit the compact commissionâs rulemaking authority solely for 2 those purposes. 3 b. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and 4 if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact 5 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary 6 to the constitution of any member state, a state seeking 7 participation in the compact, or of the United States, or 8 the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, 9 or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of 10 competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this 11 compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, 12 agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. 13 c. Notwithstanding paragraph âbâ , the compact commission may 14 deny a stateâs participation in the compact or, in accordance 15 with the requirements of subsection 11, paragraph âbâ , 16 terminate a member stateâs participation in the compact, if it 17 determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state 18 is a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this 19 compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any 20 member state, the compact shall remain in full force and effect 21 as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect 22 as to the member state affected as to all severable matters. 23 14. Consistent effect and conflict with other state laws. 24 a. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement 25 of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent 26 with the compact. 27 b. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal 28 requirements in a member state in conflict with the compact are 29 superseded to the extent of the conflict. 30 c. All permissible agreements between the compact commission 31 and the member states are binding in accordance with their 32 terms. 33 EXPLANATION 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 35 -30- LSB 1080HV (1) 91 ss/ko 30/ 31 H.F. 532 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 1 This bill establishes the dietitian licensure compact. 2 The compact establishes a system whereby a dietitian 3 licensed to practice in one member state may practice in 4 another member state under a multistate license without 5 applying for a license in that state. The compact imposes 6 certain minimum requirements on the licensure of dietitians in 7 member states. 8 The compact creates a commission to administer the operation 9 of the compact. The commission is an instrumentality of the 10 member states. The compact includes provisions relating to the 11 establishment and membership of the commission; powers of the 12 commission, meetings and voting requirements of the commission; 13 commission bylaws and rules; commission committees; commission 14 finances; the establishment of a licensure data system; 15 oversight by member states; compacting state compliance; 16 venue for judicial proceedings; defense and indemnification; 17 effective dates and amendments to the compact; withdrawal, 18 default, and expulsion; severability and construction; and the 19 binding effect of the compact and other laws. 20 The compact becomes effective upon the adoption of the 21 compact by the seventh participating state. 22 -31- LSB 1080HV (1) 91 ss/ko 31/ 31
