Under current law, the tax rate 35 -13- LSB 1774SV (3) 91 ll/ns 13/ 18 S.F. 613 imposed on sports wagering net receipts of a licensed 1 operator is 6.75 percent, which is deposited in the sports 2 wagering receipts fund. The bill increases the rate to 9 3 percent. For FY 2026-2027 and each fiscal year thereafter, 4 the bill appropriates $8 million from the sports wagering 5 receipts fund to the public safety equipment fund, which is 6 used by the department of public safety (DPS) for purchase, 7 maintenance, and replacement of equipment. The bill exempts 8 the appropriated moneys from the sports wagering receipts 9 fund reporting requirements under current law, as current law 10 already requires DPS to report on the use of moneys in the 11 public safety equipment fund. 12 Under current law, to determine the license fees and 13 regulatory fees to be charged in accordance with Code sections 14 99D.14 and 99F.10, the state racing and gaming commission 15 (commission) must use the amount appropriated to the commission 16 plus the gaming enforcement costs of DPSâs division of criminal 17 investigation. The portion of the fees associated with such 18 enforcement costs is deposited in the gaming enforcement 19 revolving fund to be annually appropriated by the general 20 assembly to DPS for gaming enforcement. The bill strikes 21 the portion of the fees that is based on DPS enforcement 22 costs, and the associated deposit in the gaming enforcement 23 revolving fund. The bill does not amend the fees associated 24 with DPS costs for fingerprinting, national criminal history 25 check requirements, and background investigations for licenses 26 to conduct internet fantasy sports contests (Code section 27 99E.4(4)). 28 Current law provides that the tax imposed on pari-mutuel 29 wagers on simulcast horse races is split in specified 30 percentages between the city and county in which the racetrack 31 is located and the commission for deposit as described in Code 32 section 8.57(3) (rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund). The bill 33 instead provides that such revenue is to be deposited in the 34 Iowa horse racing fund, created in the bill, to be used by the 35 -14- LSB 1774SV (3) 91 ll/ns 14/ 18 S.F. 613 commission for distribution to entities subject to federal 1 horse racing regulations. 2 Under current law, the annual license fee to operate an 3 excursion gambling boat or gambling structure is $5 per person 4 capacity. The bill increases the rate to $10 per person 5 capacity. 6 Under current law, a tax is imposed on the adjusted gross 7 receipts received each fiscal year from excursion gambling 8 boats, gambling structures, and racetrack enclosures conducting 9 gambling games. The rate is 5 percent on the first $1 million 10 and 10 percent on the next $2 million. Over $3 million, 11 the tax rate is 22 percent for an excursion gambling boat 12 or gambling structure, and between 22 and 24 percent for a 13 racetrack enclosure based on the existence of an excursion 14 gambling boat or gambling structure in the same county, whether 15 the racetrack enclosure has been issued a table games license, 16 and whether adjusted gross receipts reached $100 million. The 17 bill eliminates this tax rate structure and imposes a tax of 22 18 percent for an excursion gambling boat or gambling structure, 19 and 24.120 percent for a racetrack enclosure, on all adjusted 20 gross receipts each fiscal year. 21 For FY 2026-2027 and each fiscal year thereafter, prior 22 to the remaining amount of the adjusted gross receipts tax 23 being credited to the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund as 24 provided under current law, an amount is credited to the gaming 25 enforcement revolving fund up to the amount appropriated by the 26 general assembly to DPS for gaming enforcement from that fund 27 for that fiscal year. 28 This division of the bill takes effect January 1, 2026. 29 IOWA MAJOR EVENTS AND TOURISM PROGRAM AND FUND. The bill 30 requires the economic development authority (authority) to 31 establish and administer an Iowa major events and tourism 32 program (program), including an Iowa major events and tourism 33 fund (fund).

The bill defines âeventâ to mean a 12 tourism-oriented athletic contest, convention, music festival, 13 or art festival. 14 The bill requires the authority to establish eligibility 15 criteria for the program by rule. The eligibility criteria 16 must include the requirement that the entity be currently 17 involved in the bidding and selection process for the event the 18 application is based upon; and that the entity must submit an 19 economic analysis of the event with the entityâs application 20 that includes but is not limited to projected hotel and 21 motel room occupancies, and the projected number of attendees 22 the event attracts from this state, other states, and other 23 countries. 24 An application is deemed to meet all eligibility criteria 25 if the state is selected as the event site after a highly 26 competitive bidding and selection process involving sites in 27 other states, if this state serves as the sole site for the 28 event, or if the sole site for the event involves a geographic 29 region that includes this state and one or more contiguous 30 states. 31 If an entityâs application meets the eligibility criteria 32 established in the bill, the staff of the authority must 33 perform an evaluation of the application and forward the 34 application and evaluation to the economic development 35 -16- LSB 1774SV (3) 91 ll/ns 16/ 18 S.F. 613 authority board (board). In evaluating an application, the 1 bill requires the authority to consider the impact on the 2 economy, the potential to attract visitors, advertising and 3 media coverage, public-to-private investment ratios, and the 4 quality, size, and scope of the event. 5 Upon review of the staff evaluation, the board may approve, 6 deny, defer, or modify the application. The bill allows the 7 board and the authority to negotiate with the entity regarding 8 the details of the event and the amount and terms of the 9 financial assistance. 10 An application remains eligible for consideration by the 11 board for up to two years from the date of receipt of the 12 application by the board. 13 The bill requires applicants to demonstrate the ability to 14 provide matching funds equal to at least 50 percent of the 15 financial assistance awarded to the applicant. 16 The bill requires the authority to establish a fund for the 17 purposes of providing financial assistance under the program. 18 The authority may administer the fund as a revolving fund. 19 Moneys in the fund that are encumbered or obligated pursuant 20 to financial assistance awarded under the program shall be 21 disbursed by the authority within five years of the date of 22 encumbrance or obligation, or the moneys shall revert to the 23 state treasury. Moneys in the fund are appropriated to the 24 authority to provide financial assistance to an entity under 25 the program. 26 An entity that is awarded financial assistance pursuant to 27 the bill is not eligible to receive financial assistance under 28 the sports tourism infrastructure program. 29 For FY 2025-2026, the bill appropriates $15 million from 30 the sports wagering receipts fund to the Iowa major events and 31 tourism fund. 32 SPORTS TOURISM MARKETING PROGRAM AND FUND ââ REPEAL. The 33 bill modifies the sports tourism marketing and infrastructure 34 program by repealing the sports tourism marketing program and 35 -17- LSB 1774SV (3) 91 ll/ns 17/ 18 S.F. 613 fund. The bill retains the sports tourism infrastructure 1 program and fund, and provides that any nonprofit organization 2 is eligible for financial assistance under the program, rather 3 than a convention and visitors bureau or certified regional 4 sports authority district. Upon the effective date of this 5 division of the bill, the bill transfers the remaining moneys 6 in the sports tourism marketing program fund to the Iowa major 7 events and tourism fund. 8 -18- LSB 1774SV (3) 91 ll/ns 18/ 18

Under current law, the tax rate 35 -13- LSB 1774SV (3) 91 ll/ns 13/ 18 S.F. 613 imposed on sports wagering net receipts of a licensed 1 operator is 6.75 percent, which is deposited in the sports 2 wagering receipts fund. The bill increases the rate to 9 3 percent. For FY 2026-2027 and each fiscal year thereafter, 4 the bill appropriates $8 million from the sports wagering 5 receipts fund to the public safety equipment fund, which is 6 used by the department of public safety (DPS) for purchase, 7 maintenance, and replacement of equipment. The bill exempts 8 the appropriated moneys from the sports wagering receipts 9 fund reporting requirements under current law, as current law 10 already requires DPS to report on the use of moneys in the 11 public safety equipment fund. 12 Under current law, to determine the license fees and 13 regulatory fees to be charged in accordance with Code sections 14 99D.14 and 99F.10, the state racing and gaming commission 15 (commission) must use the amount appropriated to the commission 16 plus the gaming enforcement costs of DPSâs division of criminal 17 investigation. The portion of the fees associated with such 18 enforcement costs is deposited in the gaming enforcement 19 revolving fund to be annually appropriated by the general 20 assembly to DPS for gaming enforcement. The bill strikes 21 the portion of the fees that is based on DPS enforcement 22 costs, and the associated deposit in the gaming enforcement 23 revolving fund. The bill does not amend the fees associated 24 with DPS costs for fingerprinting, national criminal history 25 check requirements, and background investigations for licenses 26 to conduct internet fantasy sports contests (Code section 27 99E.4(4)). 28 Current law provides that the tax imposed on pari-mutuel 29 wagers on simulcast horse races is split in specified 30 percentages between the city and county in which the racetrack 31 is located and the commission for deposit as described in Code 32 section 8.57(3) (rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund). The bill 33 instead provides that such revenue is to be deposited in the 34 Iowa horse racing fund, created in the bill, to be used by the 35 -14- LSB 1774SV (3) 91 ll/ns 14/ 18 S.F. 613 commission for distribution to entities subject to federal 1 horse racing regulations. 2 Under current law, the annual license fee to operate an 3 excursion gambling boat or gambling structure is $5 per person 4 capacity. The bill increases the rate to $10 per person 5 capacity. 6 Under current law, a tax is imposed on the adjusted gross 7 receipts received each fiscal year from excursion gambling 8 boats, gambling structures, and racetrack enclosures conducting 9 gambling games. The rate is 5 percent on the first $1 million 10 and 10 percent on the next $2 million. Over $3 million, 11 the tax rate is 22 percent for an excursion gambling boat 12 or gambling structure, and between 22 and 24 percent for a 13 racetrack enclosure based on the existence of an excursion 14 gambling boat or gambling structure in the same county, whether 15 the racetrack enclosure has been issued a table games license, 16 and whether adjusted gross receipts reached $100 million. The 17 bill eliminates this tax rate structure and imposes a tax of 22 18 percent for an excursion gambling boat or gambling structure, 19 and 24.120 percent for a racetrack enclosure, on all adjusted 20 gross receipts each fiscal year. 21 For FY 2026-2027 and each fiscal year thereafter, prior 22 to the remaining amount of the adjusted gross receipts tax 23 being credited to the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund as 24 provided under current law, an amount is credited to the gaming 25 enforcement revolving fund up to the amount appropriated by the 26 general assembly to DPS for gaming enforcement from that fund 27 for that fiscal year. 28 This division of the bill takes effect January 1, 2026. 29 IOWA MAJOR EVENTS AND TOURISM PROGRAM AND FUND. The bill 30 requires the economic development authority (authority) to 31 establish and administer an Iowa major events and tourism 32 program (program), including an Iowa major events and tourism 33 fund (fund). The purpose of the program is to provide 34 financial assistance, including grants, to an entity supporting 35 -15- LSB 1774SV (3) 91 ll/ns 15/ 18 S.F. 613 an event in this state, or an event involving a geographic 1 region that includes this state, if the event generates large 2 attendance, significant publicity, and measurable economic 3 impact on this state. The financial assistance includes 4 payment or reimbursement of costs incurred by the entity to 5 apply or bid for selection as the site event, to plan or 6 conduct the event, and to pay or reimburse any related fees 7 including hosting fees, sanctioning fees, participation fees, 8 operational fees, and bid fees. 9 The bill defines âentityâ to mean an Iowa nonprofit 10 organization established to promote economic development 11 and tourism in an area. The bill defines âeventâ to mean a 12 tourism-oriented athletic contest, convention, music festival, 13 or art festival. 14 The bill requires the authority to establish eligibility 15 criteria for the program by rule. The eligibility criteria 16 must include the requirement that the entity be currently 17 involved in the bidding and selection process for the event the 18 application is based upon; and that the entity must submit an 19 economic analysis of the event with the entityâs application 20 that includes but is not limited to projected hotel and 21 motel room occupancies, and the projected number of attendees 22 the event attracts from this state, other states, and other 23 countries. 24 An application is deemed to meet all eligibility criteria 25 if the state is selected as the event site after a highly 26 competitive bidding and selection process involving sites in 27 other states, if this state serves as the sole site for the 28 event, or if the sole site for the event involves a geographic 29 region that includes this state and one or more contiguous 30 states. 31 If an entityâs application meets the eligibility criteria 32 established in the bill, the staff of the authority must 33 perform an evaluation of the application and forward the 34 application and evaluation to the economic development 35 -16- LSB 1774SV (3) 91 ll/ns 16/ 18 S.F. 613 authority board (board). In evaluating an application, the 1 bill requires the authority to consider the impact on the 2 economy, the potential to attract visitors, advertising and 3 media coverage, public-to-private investment ratios, and the 4 quality, size, and scope of the event. 5 Upon review of the staff evaluation, the board may approve, 6 deny, defer, or modify the application. The bill allows the 7 board and the authority to negotiate with the entity regarding 8 the details of the event and the amount and terms of the 9 financial assistance. 10 An application remains eligible for consideration by the 11 board for up to two years from the date of receipt of the 12 application by the board. 13 The bill requires applicants to demonstrate the ability to 14 provide matching funds equal to at least 50 percent of the 15 financial assistance awarded to the applicant. 16 The bill requires the authority to establish a fund for the 17 purposes of providing financial assistance under the program. 18 The authority may administer the fund as a revolving fund. 19 Moneys in the fund that are encumbered or obligated pursuant 20 to financial assistance awarded under the program shall be 21 disbursed by the authority within five years of the date of 22 encumbrance or obligation, or the moneys shall revert to the 23 state treasury. Moneys in the fund are appropriated to the 24 authority to provide financial assistance to an entity under 25 the program. 26 An entity that is awarded financial assistance pursuant to 27 the bill is not eligible to receive financial assistance under 28 the sports tourism infrastructure program. 29 For FY 2025-2026, the bill appropriates $15 million from 30 the sports wagering receipts fund to the Iowa major events and 31 tourism fund. 32 SPORTS TOURISM MARKETING PROGRAM AND FUND ââ REPEAL. The 33 bill modifies the sports tourism marketing and infrastructure 34 program by repealing the sports tourism marketing program and 35 -17- LSB 1774SV (3) 91 ll/ns 17/ 18 S.F. 613 fund. The bill retains the sports tourism infrastructure 1 program and fund, and provides that any nonprofit organization 2 is eligible for financial assistance under the program, rather 3 than a convention and visitors bureau or certified regional 4 sports authority district. Upon the effective date of this 5 division of the bill, the bill transfers the remaining moneys 6 in the sports tourism marketing program fund to the Iowa major 7 events and tourism fund. 8 -18- LSB 1774SV (3) 91 ll/ns 18/ 18
