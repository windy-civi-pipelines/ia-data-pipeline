The bill prohibits the board from issuing more than 33 four licenses to operate an independent psilocybin testing 34 laboratory and allows the board to operate an independent 35 -37- LSB 1463HH (6) 91 ss/ko 37/ 45 H.F. 620 psilocybin testing laboratory.

The 22 bill allows the department to require an independent psilocybin 23 testing laboratory to participate in a proficiency evaluation. 24 If an independent psilocybin testing laboratory determines that 25 a psilocybin product is unsafe for human use, the bill requires 26 the independent psilocybin testing laboratory to inform the 27 department and the psilocybin cultivation facility from which 28 the batch originated, and the department shall place a hold on 29 the sale and use of the psilocybin product until the department 30 completes an investigation. 31 The bill requires the department, in consultation with the 32 departments of agriculture and public safety, to adopt rules 33 for the creation and operation of an electronic verification 34 system.
