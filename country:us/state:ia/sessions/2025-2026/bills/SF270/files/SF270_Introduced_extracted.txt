The authority shall not revoke or recapture a tax credit 35 -11- LSB 2290XS (2) 91 jm/jh 11/ 22 S.F. 270 for any action of a growth fund that occurs after the growth 1 fund has exited the program pursuant to section 15.516.

Â§681, documentation that establishes 23 that at least one principal of the applicant has been an 24 officer or an employee of the rural business investment 25 company, the small business investment company or an affiliate, 26 for a minimum of four years prior to the date of application, a 27 revenue impact assessment for the applicantâs proposed growth 28 investments as determined by an econometric analysis conducted 29 by a third-party independent econometric firm, the number 30 of jobs created and the number of jobs retained assumed in 31 the revenue impact assessment, a signed affidavit from each 32 investor that states the amount of the credit-eligible capital 33 contribution that the investor has committed to the applicantâs 34 proposed growth fund, and a nonrefundable $5,000 application 35 -15- LSB 2290XS (2) 91 jm/jh 15/ 22 S.F. 270 fee. The bill defines âgrowth investmentâ to mean any of 1 the following: capital or equity investments in a qualified 2 business, a loan to a qualified business subject to certain 3 conditions, or a senior secured loan under certain conditions. 4 The bill defines âcredit-eligible capital contributionâ 5 as an investment of cash by a person in a growth fund that 6 is eligible for a tax credit issued by the authority. The 7 investment must be used to purchase either an equity interest 8 in the growth fund or a debt instrument, at par value or 9 premium, issued by the growth fund that has a maturity date 10 at least six years after the growth fundâs closing date. 11 âEligible investment authorityâ is defined in the bill as the 12 amount of investment authority that the authority certifies for 13 a specific growth fund. 14 The bill requires the authority to review each application 15 on a first-come, first-served basis and to make a determination 16 to approve or deny each application within the time frame 17 adopted by rule by the authority. The authority shall not 18 approve more than $45 million in eligible investment authority 19 and not more than $27 million in credit-eligible capital 20 contributions. 21 The authority must reject an application if the applicant 22 fails to submit any of the required information, or if the 23 authority has already approved the maximum eligible investment 24 authority or the maximum credit-eligible capital contributions. 25 If the authority rejects an application, the authority must 26 send a notice of rejection to the applicant, and provide a 27 reason for the rejection. If an application has been rejected 28 because the applicant failed to submit all of the required 29 information, the applicant has 15 days to provide additional 30 information to cure any defects in the application. The 31 authority shall review and reconsider, within the time frame 32 adopted by rule by the authority, any application for which 33 additional information is provided within the 15 business days. 34 If an application is approved by the authority after review and 35 -16- LSB 2290XS (2) 91 jm/jh 16/ 22 S.F. 270 reconsideration, the application shall be considered complete 1 as of its original date of submission. 2 If the authority approves an application, the authority 3 must send a notice to the applicant certifying the applicant 4 as a rural business growth fund, the growth fundâs eligible 5 investment authority, and the required number of jobs created 6 and the required number of jobs retained based on the number 7 submitted in the applicantâs application. Within 45 days of 8 the date the authority sent the notice of certification, the 9 growth fund is required to collect all credit-eligible capital 10 contributions from each investor whose affidavit was included 11 in the growth fundâs application, collect one or more equity 12 investments contributed directly or indirectly by affiliates 13 of the growth fund, including employees and principals of 14 such affiliates, that equal at least 10 percent of the growth 15 fundâs eligible investment authority, and collect one or more 16 investments of cash that when added to the credit-eligible 17 capital contributions and the equity investments equal the 18 growth fundâs eligible investment authority. Within 65 days 19 of the date the authority sent the notice of certification, 20 the growth fund must submit documentation to the authority 21 to prove that the appropriate amounts have been collected 22 by the growth fund, and documentation that identifies all 23 affiliates of the investor that may be eligible to claim a 24 tax credit issued by the authority. If the growth fund fails 25 to comply with the collection and documentation requirements, 26 all eligible investment authority and credit-eligible capital 27 contributions lapse. Eligible investment authority and 28 credit-eligible capital contributions that lapse do not count 29 toward the maximum limits on eligible investment authority and 30 credit-eligible capital contributions and may be awarded by the 31 authority as outlined in the bill. 32 If a growth fund successfully complies with the collection 33 and documentation requirements, the growth fund must enter 34 into an agreement with the authority that specifies the 35 -17- LSB 2290XS (2) 91 jm/jh 17/ 22 S.F. 270 requirements that must be met for successful completion of 1 the program. The agreement must contain, at a minimum, the 2 legal name of the growth fund, the growth fundâs closing date, 3 the growth fundâs eligible investment authority as certified 4 by the authority, each investor of the growth fund and each 5 investorâs credit-eligible capital contribution, the minimum 6 number of jobs that must be created and the minimum number of 7 jobs that must be retained as a result of the growth fundâs 8 growth investments to avoid paying state reimbursement, and a 9 provision related to revocation and recapture of tax credits if 10 the growth fund fails to meet the applicable program investment 11 requirements. 12 After the agreement is executed, the authority must issue 13 a tax credit certificate to each investor whose affidavit 14 was included in the growth fundâs application and whose 15 credit-eligible capital contribution was collected by the 16 growth fund. The certificate must specify the amount of tax 17 credit allocated to that investor and the amount of the tax 18 credit the eligible taxpayer may claim against the franchise 19 tax imposed in Code section 422.60, the insurance premium tax 20 and insurance retaliatory premium tax imposed in Code chapter 21 432, or the moneys and credits tax imposed in Code section 22 533.329. The tax credit allocated to any one investor is equal 23 to the investorâs credit-eligible capital contribution to the 24 growth fund. An investor may use one-third percent of the tax 25 credit in each taxable year beginning in the calendar year 26 following the third, fourth, and fifth anniversaries of the 27 growth fundâs closing date. Any tax credit in excess of the 28 taxpayerâs tax liability for a tax year may be carried forward 29 to the taxpayerâs tax liability for subsequent tax years until 30 the tax credit is depleted. 31 The tax credits are not refundable and cannot be sold, 32 transferred, or allocated by the investor to any person other 33 than an affiliate of the investor. The affiliate must submit 34 the tax credit certificate within 90 days to the department 35 -18- LSB 2290XS (2) 91 jm/jh 18/ 22 S.F. 270 of revenue (department) along with a statement containing the 1 affiliateâs name, tax identification number, address, and any 2 other information required by the department. The department 3 must issue the affiliate a replacement tax credit certificate 4 with the same expiration date that appeared on the original tax 5 credit certificate. 6 The authority shall revoke or recapture a tax credit if, 7 before a growth fund exits the program, the growth fund cannot 8 provide documentation to the authority to substantiate that the 9 growth fund, within 30 months after the growth fundâs closing 10 date, has invested 100 percent of the growth fundâs investment 11 authority in growth investments; that the growth fund, after 12 investing 100 percent of the growth fundâs investment authority 13 in growth investments within 30 months after the growth fundâs 14 closing date, has maintained growth investments equal to 100 15 percent of its investment authority at all times up to the 16 fifth anniversary after the growth fundâs closing date. The 17 bill specifies that a growth investment is maintained even if 18 it is sold or repaid, as long as the growth fund reinvests an 19 amount equal to the growth investment returned or recovered 20 from the original investment, exclusive of any profits 21 realized, in other growth investments in this state within the 22 12 consecutive months immediately after the date of the return 23 or recovery of such growth investment. The bill also specifies 24 that amounts received periodically by a growth fund are deemed 25 continuously invested in growth investments if the amounts 26 are reinvested by the growth fund in one or more qualified 27 businesses by the end of the following calendar year. 28 The authority must also revoke or recapture a tax credit 29 if, before a growth fund exits the program, the growth 30 fund makes a growth investment in a qualified business that 31 directly, or indirectly through an affiliate, owns, has the 32 right to acquire an ownership interest in, makes a loan to, 33 or makes an investment in, the growth fund, an affiliate of 34 the growth fund, or an investor in the growth fund. This does 35 -19- LSB 2290XS (2) 91 jm/jh 19/ 22 S.F. 270 not apply to investments in publicly traded securities by a 1 qualified business, or to an owner or an affiliate of the 2 qualified business. Further, a growth fund is not considered 3 an affiliate of a qualified business solely because of its 4 growth investment in the qualified business. The authority 5 is also required to revoke or recapture a tax credit if the 6 growth fund, before it exits the program, makes a distribution 7 or payment that results in the growth fund having less than 100 8 percent of its initial investment authority invested in growth 9 investments in this state, available for growth investments, 10 or held in cash and marketable securities. A growth fund may 11 count the greater of 20 percent of the growth fundâs eligible 12 investment authority and $5 million, excluding any amounts 13 reinvested in a qualified business, toward the growth fundâs 14 satisfaction of the investment requirements. Before the 15 authority revokes or recaptures a tax credit, the authority 16 must provide notice to the growth fund of the reason for the 17 pending revocation or recapture and the growth fund has 90 days 18 to address any issues identified in the notice. Failure of the 19 growth fund to address any of the issues in the notice results 20 in revocation or recapture of the tax credit. 21 The bill prohibits the authority from revoking or 22 recapturing a tax credit for any action of a growth fund that 23 occurs after the growth fund has exited the program. The bill 24 does not, however, prohibit the authority from revoking a tax 25 credit due to an action of a growth fund that occurs before the 26 growth fund exits the program, even if the growth fundâs action 27 is discovered after the growth fund exits the program. 28 On or after the fifth anniversary of a growth fundâs closing 29 date, the growth fund may apply to the authority to exit the 30 program. A growth fund is eligible to exit the program if a 31 tax credit associated with the growth fund has not been revoked 32 or recaptured. The growth fundâs application must include the 33 state reimbursement calculation. The state reimbursement owed 34 by a rural business growth fund to the authority is calculated 35 -20- LSB 2290XS (2) 91 jm/jh 20/ 22 S.F. 270 as detailed in the bill. Within the time frame adopted by rule 1 by the authority, the authority shall send notice to the growth 2 fund of the authorityâs determination regarding the application 3 and confirmation of the state reimbursement owed by the growth 4 fund. If the authority denies the application, the notice must 5 include the reasons for the denial. If the authority approves 6 the application, the growth fund is deemed to have exited the 7 program on the date the notice is sent by the authority to the 8 growth fund. If the growth fund owes the state reimbursement, 9 the growth fund is prohibited from making any distributions to 10 equity holders of the fund until the state reimbursement amount 11 has been remitted to the authority. âEquity holderâ is defined 12 in the bill as a person that makes a credit-eligible capital 13 contribution, an equity investment, or a cash investment in 14 a rural business growth fund. The bill specifies that all 15 state reimbursement amounts remitted to the authority shall be 16 deposited in the general fund of the state. 17 Unless a growth fund has exited the program, the growth 18 fund must submit an annual report to the authority that 19 covers the preceding calendar year. The report must include 20 documentation for each of the growth fundâs growth investments 21 and must include financial statements that provide evidence 22 of each growth investment, evidence that the growth fund is 23 in compliance with applicable investment requirements; the 24 name, location, and industry for each qualified business that 25 received a growth investment; evidence that each business met 26 the requirements to be a qualified business at the time the 27 growth investment was made; the number of employees at each 28 qualified business on the date of the growth fundâs initial 29 growth investment; the number of jobs created at each qualified 30 business; the average annual salary for the jobs created; the 31 number of jobs retained at each qualified business; and the 32 average annual salary for the jobs retained. 33 The bill provides that the only remedies for a breach or 34 default of any of the terms of the program by a growth fund 35 -21- LSB 2290XS (2) 91 jm/jh 21/ 22 S.F. 270 are revocation or recapture of tax credits and the state 1 reimbursement as detailed in the bill. 2 The bill requires the authority, in conjunction with the 3 department, to adopt rules as necessary to implement and 4 administer the program. 5 -22- LSB 2290XS (2) 91 jm/jh 22/ 22

The tax 33 credit allocated to any one investor shall be equal to the 34 investorâs credit-eligible capital contribution to the growth 35 -8- LSB 2290XS (2) 91 jm/jh 8/ 22 S.F. 270 fund. The tax credit certificate shall contain the taxpayerâs 1 name, address, tax identification number, the name of the 2 rural business growth fund associated with the tax credit, and 3 any other information required by the department of revenue. 4 The tax credit may be claimed against the taxes imposed in 5 chapter 422, subchapter V, the insurance premium and insurance 6 retaliatory premium tax imposed in chapter 432, or the moneys 7 and credits tax imposed in section 533.329. 8 2. One-third of the amount of a tax credit issued to an 9 investor pursuant to subsection 1 may be claimed in the tax 10 year of the third, fourth, and fifth anniversaries of the 11 growth fundâs closing date, exclusive of the amount of tax 12 credit carried forward pursuant to subsection 4. 13 3. a. A tax credit issued under this part is not 14 refundable and shall not be sold, transferred, or allocated 15 by the investor to any person other than an affiliate of the 16 investor that was an affiliate at the time of the growth fundâs 17 submission of the investorâs affidavit pursuant to section 18 15.512, subsection 2, paragraph âfâ . 19 b. Within ninety calendar days of the sale, transfer, or 20 allocation of a tax credit, the affiliate shall submit the tax 21 credit certificate to the department of revenue along with a 22 statement containing the affiliateâs name, tax identification 23 number, address, and any other information required by the 24 department of revenue. 25 c. Within thirty calendar days of receiving the tax credit 26 certificate and the affiliateâs statement, the department of 27 revenue shall issue the affiliate a replacement tax credit 28 certificate. The replacement tax credit certificate must 29 contain all of the information required for the original tax 30 credit certificate and must have the same expiration date that 31 appeared on the original tax credit certificate. 32 4. To claim a tax credit under this section, a taxpayer 33 shall submit the tax credit certificate with the taxpayerâs 34 tax return for each taxable year in which the tax credit is 35 -9- LSB 2290XS (2) 91 jm/jh 9/ 22 S.F. 270 claimed.

NEW SECTION . 15.514 Revocation and recapture of tax 5 credits. 6 1. The authority shall recapture any tax credits used by 7 a taxpayer and shall revoke any tax credits issued pursuant 8 to section 15.513, subsection 1, if, before a rural business 9 growth fund exits the program pursuant to section 15.516, any 10 of the following occur: 11 a. The growth fund cannot provide documentation to the 12 authority to substantiate to the satisfaction of the authority 13 all of the following: 14 (1) That the growth fund, within thirty months after the 15 growth fundâs closing date, has invested one hundred percent 16 of the growth fundâs eligible investment authority in growth 17 investments. 18 (2) That the growth fund, after investing one hundred 19 percent of the growth fundâs eligible investment authority 20 in growth investments within thirty months after the growth 21 fundâs closing date, has maintained growth investments equal to 22 one hundred percent of the growth fundâs eligible investment 23 authority at all times up to the fifth anniversary after the 24 growth fundâs closing date. For purposes of this subparagraph, 25 a growth investment is maintained even if it is sold or repaid, 26 as long as the growth fund reinvests an amount equal to the 27 growth investment returned or recovered from the original 28 growth investment, exclusive of any profits realized, in other 29 growth investments in this state within the twelve consecutive 30 months immediately after the date of the return or recovery 31 of such growth investment. Amounts received periodically 32 by a growth fund are deemed continuously invested in growth 33 investments if the amounts are reinvested by the growth fund in 34 one or more qualified businesses by the end of the following 35 -10- LSB 2290XS (2) 91 jm/jh 10/ 22 S.F. 270 calendar year. 1 b. The growth fund makes a growth investment in a qualified 2 business that directly, or indirectly through an affiliate, 3 owns, has the right to acquire an ownership interest in, makes 4 a loan to, or makes an investment in, the growth fund, an 5 affiliate of the growth fund, or an investor in the growth 6 fund. This paragraph shall not apply to investments in 7 publicly traded securities by a qualified business, or to an 8 owner or an affiliate of the qualified business. For purposes 9 of this paragraph, a growth fund shall not be considered an 10 affiliate of a qualified business solely because of the growth 11 fundâs growth investment in the qualified business. 12 c. The growth fund, before exiting the program pursuant to 13 section 15.516, makes a distribution or payment that results 14 in the growth fund having less than one hundred percent of its 15 initial investment authority invested in growth investments in 16 this state, available for growth investments, or held in cash 17 and marketable securities. 18 2. The maximum amount of a growth investment in a qualified 19 business, including any amounts invested in affiliates of the 20 qualified business, that a growth fund may count toward the 21 growth fundâs satisfaction of the requirements pursuant to 22 subsection 1, paragraph âaâ , is the greater of twenty percent of 23 the growth fundâs eligible investment authority and two million 24 five hundred thousand dollars, excluding any amounts reinvested 25 in a qualified business. 26 3. Before revoking or recapturing a tax credit, the 27 authority shall provide notice to the growth fund of the reason 28 for the pending revocation or recapture. The growth fund shall 29 have ninety calendar days after the date the authority sends 30 the notice to address to the satisfaction of the authority any 31 issues identified in the notice. Failure of the growth fund to 32 satisfactorily address any issues in the notice shall result in 33 revocation or recapture of the tax credit. 34 4. The authority shall not revoke or recapture a tax credit 35 -11- LSB 2290XS (2) 91 jm/jh 11/ 22 S.F. 270 for any action of a growth fund that occurs after the growth 1 fund has exited the program pursuant to section 15.516. This 2 subsection shall not prohibit the authority from revoking or 3 recapturing a tax credit due to an action of a growth fund 4 pursuant to subsection 1 that occurs before the date the growth 5 fund exits the program, even if the growth fundâs action is 6 discovered after the date the growth fund exits the program. 7 Sec. 6. NEW SECTION . 15.515 Annual report. 8 On or before March 31, unless a growth fund has exited the 9 program pursuant to section 15.516, each growth fund shall 10 submit an annual report to the authority in the form and manner 11 the authority prescribes that covers the preceding calendar 12 year. The report must include each of the growth fundâs growth 13 investments and must contain all of the following information: 14 1. Financial statements that provide evidence of each 15 growth investment. 16 2. Evidence that the growth fund is in compliance with 17 applicable investment requirements pursuant to section 15.514, 18 subsection 1, paragraph âaâ . 19 3. The name, location, and industry for each qualified 20 business that received a growth investment, and evidence that 21 the business met the requirements to be a qualified business at 22 the time the growth investment was made. 23 4. The number of employees at each qualified business on 24 the date of the growth fundâs initial growth investment in the 25 qualified business. 26 5. The number of jobs created at each qualified business and 27 the average annual salary for the jobs created. 28 6. The number of jobs retained at each qualified business 29 and the average annual salary for the jobs retained. The 30 number of jobs retained at a qualified business may not exceed 31 the number of jobs retained at the same qualified business on 32 the first annual report submitted by the growth fund. 33 7. Any other information the authority requires. 34 Sec. 7. NEW SECTION . 15.516 Exiting the program. 35 -12- LSB 2290XS (2) 91 jm/jh 12/ 22 S.F. 270 1. On or after the fifth anniversary of a rural business 1 growth fundâs closing date, in the form and manner the 2 authority prescribes, the growth fund may apply to the 3 authority to exit the program. The growth fundâs application 4 must include the state reimbursement calculation pursuant to 5 section 15.517. 6 2. The growth fund shall be eligible to exit the program 7 if a tax credit associated with the growth fund has not been 8 revoked or recaptured pursuant to section 15.514. 9 3. Within the time frame adopted by rule by the authority, 10 the authority shall send notice to the growth fund of the 11 authorityâs determination regarding the growth fundâs 12 application and confirmation of the state reimbursement the 13 growth fund owes pursuant to section 15.517. If the authority 14 denies the growth fundâs application, the notice shall include 15 the reasons for the denial. If the authority approves the 16 growth fundâs application, the growth fund is deemed to have 17 exited the program on the date the authority sends notice 18 to the growth fund. If the growth fund owes the state 19 reimbursement, the growth fund shall be prohibited from making 20 any distributions to any equity holders of the fund until the 21 growth fund has remitted the state reimbursement amount to the 22 authority. All state reimbursement amounts remitted to the 23 authority shall be deposited in the general fund of the state. 24 Sec. 8. NEW SECTION . 15.517 State reimbursement 25 calculation. 26 1. A state reimbursement shall be calculated any time a 27 rural business growth fund exits the program or any time a 28 rural business growth fund proposes to make a distribution to 29 the growth fundâs equity holders. The state reimbursement 30 shall equal the proposed distribution multiplied by one minus a 31 fraction that is composed of the following: 32 a. The numerator shall be the aggregate number of jobs 33 created plus the number of jobs retained as reported pursuant 34 to section 15.515, subsections 5 and 6. 35 -13- LSB 2290XS (2) 91 jm/jh 13/ 22 S.F. 270 b. The denominator shall be the number of jobs created plus 1 the number of jobs retained as stated in the certification 2 pursuant to section 15.512, subsection 7, paragraph âaâ , 3 subparagraph (3). 4 2. If the fraction is greater than one hundred percent, the 5 growth fund shall not owe state reimbursement. 6 3. The authority may adopt by rule additional options 7 for the state reimbursement calculation that are equivalent 8 to job creation and job retention to measure a growth fundâs 9 growth investments impact on economic activity at a qualified 10 business. 11 Sec. 9. NEW SECTION . 15.518 Remedies. 12 The remedies for a breach or default of any of the terms of 13 this part by a rural business growth fund shall be revocation 14 or recapture of tax credits pursuant to section 15.514 and the 15 state reimbursement pursuant to section 15.517. 16 Sec. 10. NEW SECTION . 15.519 Rules. 17 The authority, in conjunction with the department of 18 revenue, shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A as necessary 19 for the implementation and administration of this part. 20 Sec. 11. Section 422.60, Code 2025, is amended by adding the 21 following new subsection: 22 NEW SUBSECTION . 16. The taxes imposed under this subchapter 23 shall be reduced by a rural development tax credit allowed 24 under section 15.513. 25 Sec. 12. NEW SECTION . 432.12P Rural development tax 26 credits. 27 The taxes imposed under this chapter shall be reduced by a 28 rural development tax credit allowed under section 15.513 for a 29 credit-eligible capital contribution to a rural business growth 30 fund. 31 Sec. 13. Section 533.329, subsection 2, Code 2025, is 32 amended by adding the following new paragraph: 33 NEW PARAGRAPH . n. The moneys and credits tax imposed under 34 this section shall be reduced by a rural development tax credit 35 -14- LSB 2290XS (2) 91 jm/jh 14/ 22 S.F. 270 under section 15.513. 1 EXPLANATION 2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 3 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 4 This bill relates to tax credits awarded by the economic 5 development authority for specific capital contributions made 6 to certified rural business growth funds for investment in 7 qualified businesses. The bill defines âqualified businessâ 8 to mean any business within this state that has fewer than 250 9 employees, including certain subcontractors, and is not located 10 in whole or in part in one or more of the 12 most populous 11 counties in the state. 12 The bill directs the economic development authority 13 (authority) to begin accepting Iowa rural development tax 14 credit program (program) applications beginning January 7, 15 2026. 16 The bill provides that a person seeking certification as 17 a rural business growth fund (growth fund) must apply to the 18 authority and that the application must include the eligible 19 investment authority sought by the applicant, a copy of the 20 applicantâs license as a rural business investment company 21 under 7 U.S.C. Â§2009cc(14) or as a small business investment 22 company under 15 U.S.C. Â§681, documentation that establishes 23 that at least one principal of the applicant has been an 24 officer or an employee of the rural business investment 25 company, the small business investment company or an affiliate, 26 for a minimum of four years prior to the date of application, a 27 revenue impact assessment for the applicantâs proposed growth 28 investments as determined by an econometric analysis conducted 29 by a third-party independent econometric firm, the number 30 of jobs created and the number of jobs retained assumed in 31 the revenue impact assessment, a signed affidavit from each 32 investor that states the amount of the credit-eligible capital 33 contribution that the investor has committed to the applicantâs 34 proposed growth fund, and a nonrefundable $5,000 application 35 -15- LSB 2290XS (2) 91 jm/jh 15/ 22 S.F. 270 fee. The bill defines âgrowth investmentâ to mean any of 1 the following: capital or equity investments in a qualified 2 business, a loan to a qualified business subject to certain 3 conditions, or a senior secured loan under certain conditions. 4 The bill defines âcredit-eligible capital contributionâ 5 as an investment of cash by a person in a growth fund that 6 is eligible for a tax credit issued by the authority. The 7 investment must be used to purchase either an equity interest 8 in the growth fund or a debt instrument, at par value or 9 premium, issued by the growth fund that has a maturity date 10 at least six years after the growth fundâs closing date. 11 âEligible investment authorityâ is defined in the bill as the 12 amount of investment authority that the authority certifies for 13 a specific growth fund. 14 The bill requires the authority to review each application 15 on a first-come, first-served basis and to make a determination 16 to approve or deny each application within the time frame 17 adopted by rule by the authority. The authority shall not 18 approve more than $45 million in eligible investment authority 19 and not more than $27 million in credit-eligible capital 20 contributions. 21 The authority must reject an application if the applicant 22 fails to submit any of the required information, or if the 23 authority has already approved the maximum eligible investment 24 authority or the maximum credit-eligible capital contributions. 25 If the authority rejects an application, the authority must 26 send a notice of rejection to the applicant, and provide a 27 reason for the rejection. If an application has been rejected 28 because the applicant failed to submit all of the required 29 information, the applicant has 15 days to provide additional 30 information to cure any defects in the application. The 31 authority shall review and reconsider, within the time frame 32 adopted by rule by the authority, any application for which 33 additional information is provided within the 15 business days. 34 If an application is approved by the authority after review and 35 -16- LSB 2290XS (2) 91 jm/jh 16/ 22 S.F. 270 reconsideration, the application shall be considered complete 1 as of its original date of submission. 2 If the authority approves an application, the authority 3 must send a notice to the applicant certifying the applicant 4 as a rural business growth fund, the growth fundâs eligible 5 investment authority, and the required number of jobs created 6 and the required number of jobs retained based on the number 7 submitted in the applicantâs application. Within 45 days of 8 the date the authority sent the notice of certification, the 9 growth fund is required to collect all credit-eligible capital 10 contributions from each investor whose affidavit was included 11 in the growth fundâs application, collect one or more equity 12 investments contributed directly or indirectly by affiliates 13 of the growth fund, including employees and principals of 14 such affiliates, that equal at least 10 percent of the growth 15 fundâs eligible investment authority, and collect one or more 16 investments of cash that when added to the credit-eligible 17 capital contributions and the equity investments equal the 18 growth fundâs eligible investment authority. Within 65 days 19 of the date the authority sent the notice of certification, 20 the growth fund must submit documentation to the authority 21 to prove that the appropriate amounts have been collected 22 by the growth fund, and documentation that identifies all 23 affiliates of the investor that may be eligible to claim a 24 tax credit issued by the authority. If the growth fund fails 25 to comply with the collection and documentation requirements, 26 all eligible investment authority and credit-eligible capital 27 contributions lapse. Eligible investment authority and 28 credit-eligible capital contributions that lapse do not count 29 toward the maximum limits on eligible investment authority and 30 credit-eligible capital contributions and may be awarded by the 31 authority as outlined in the bill. 32 If a growth fund successfully complies with the collection 33 and documentation requirements, the growth fund must enter 34 into an agreement with the authority that specifies the 35 -17- LSB 2290XS (2) 91 jm/jh 17/ 22 S.F. 270 requirements that must be met for successful completion of 1 the program. The agreement must contain, at a minimum, the 2 legal name of the growth fund, the growth fundâs closing date, 3 the growth fundâs eligible investment authority as certified 4 by the authority, each investor of the growth fund and each 5 investorâs credit-eligible capital contribution, the minimum 6 number of jobs that must be created and the minimum number of 7 jobs that must be retained as a result of the growth fundâs 8 growth investments to avoid paying state reimbursement, and a 9 provision related to revocation and recapture of tax credits if 10 the growth fund fails to meet the applicable program investment 11 requirements. 12 After the agreement is executed, the authority must issue 13 a tax credit certificate to each investor whose affidavit 14 was included in the growth fundâs application and whose 15 credit-eligible capital contribution was collected by the 16 growth fund. The certificate must specify the amount of tax 17 credit allocated to that investor and the amount of the tax 18 credit the eligible taxpayer may claim against the franchise 19 tax imposed in Code section 422.60, the insurance premium tax 20 and insurance retaliatory premium tax imposed in Code chapter 21 432, or the moneys and credits tax imposed in Code section 22 533.329. The tax credit allocated to any one investor is equal 23 to the investorâs credit-eligible capital contribution to the 24 growth fund. An investor may use one-third percent of the tax 25 credit in each taxable year beginning in the calendar year 26 following the third, fourth, and fifth anniversaries of the 27 growth fundâs closing date. Any tax credit in excess of the 28 taxpayerâs tax liability for a tax year may be carried forward 29 to the taxpayerâs tax liability for subsequent tax years until 30 the tax credit is depleted. 31 The tax credits are not refundable and cannot be sold, 32 transferred, or allocated by the investor to any person other 33 than an affiliate of the investor. The affiliate must submit 34 the tax credit certificate within 90 days to the department 35 -18- LSB 2290XS (2) 91 jm/jh 18/ 22 S.F. 270 of revenue (department) along with a statement containing the 1 affiliateâs name, tax identification number, address, and any 2 other information required by the department. The department 3 must issue the affiliate a replacement tax credit certificate 4 with the same expiration date that appeared on the original tax 5 credit certificate. 6 The authority shall revoke or recapture a tax credit if, 7 before a growth fund exits the program, the growth fund cannot 8 provide documentation to the authority to substantiate that the 9 growth fund, within 30 months after the growth fundâs closing 10 date, has invested 100 percent of the growth fundâs investment 11 authority in growth investments; that the growth fund, after 12 investing 100 percent of the growth fundâs investment authority 13 in growth investments within 30 months after the growth fundâs 14 closing date, has maintained growth investments equal to 100 15 percent of its investment authority at all times up to the 16 fifth anniversary after the growth fundâs closing date. The 17 bill specifies that a growth investment is maintained even if 18 it is sold or repaid, as long as the growth fund reinvests an 19 amount equal to the growth investment returned or recovered 20 from the original investment, exclusive of any profits 21 realized, in other growth investments in this state within the 22 12 consecutive months immediately after the date of the return 23 or recovery of such growth investment. The bill also specifies 24 that amounts received periodically by a growth fund are deemed 25 continuously invested in growth investments if the amounts 26 are reinvested by the growth fund in one or more qualified 27 businesses by the end of the following calendar year. 28 The authority must also revoke or recapture a tax credit 29 if, before a growth fund exits the program, the growth 30 fund makes a growth investment in a qualified business that 31 directly, or indirectly through an affiliate, owns, has the 32 right to acquire an ownership interest in, makes a loan to, 33 or makes an investment in, the growth fund, an affiliate of 34 the growth fund, or an investor in the growth fund. This does 35 -19- LSB 2290XS (2) 91 jm/jh 19/ 22 S.F. 270 not apply to investments in publicly traded securities by a 1 qualified business, or to an owner or an affiliate of the 2 qualified business. Further, a growth fund is not considered 3 an affiliate of a qualified business solely because of its 4 growth investment in the qualified business. The authority 5 is also required to revoke or recapture a tax credit if the 6 growth fund, before it exits the program, makes a distribution 7 or payment that results in the growth fund having less than 100 8 percent of its initial investment authority invested in growth 9 investments in this state, available for growth investments, 10 or held in cash and marketable securities. A growth fund may 11 count the greater of 20 percent of the growth fundâs eligible 12 investment authority and $5 million, excluding any amounts 13 reinvested in a qualified business, toward the growth fundâs 14 satisfaction of the investment requirements. Before the 15 authority revokes or recaptures a tax credit, the authority 16 must provide notice to the growth fund of the reason for the 17 pending revocation or recapture and the growth fund has 90 days 18 to address any issues identified in the notice. Failure of the 19 growth fund to address any of the issues in the notice results 20 in revocation or recapture of the tax credit. 21 The bill prohibits the authority from revoking or 22 recapturing a tax credit for any action of a growth fund that 23 occurs after the growth fund has exited the program. The bill 24 does not, however, prohibit the authority from revoking a tax 25 credit due to an action of a growth fund that occurs before the 26 growth fund exits the program, even if the growth fundâs action 27 is discovered after the growth fund exits the program. 28 On or after the fifth anniversary of a growth fundâs closing 29 date, the growth fund may apply to the authority to exit the 30 program. A growth fund is eligible to exit the program if a 31 tax credit associated with the growth fund has not been revoked 32 or recaptured. The growth fundâs application must include the 33 state reimbursement calculation. The state reimbursement owed 34 by a rural business growth fund to the authority is calculated 35 -20- LSB 2290XS (2) 91 jm/jh 20/ 22 S.F. 270 as detailed in the bill. Within the time frame adopted by rule 1 by the authority, the authority shall send notice to the growth 2 fund of the authorityâs determination regarding the application 3 and confirmation of the state reimbursement owed by the growth 4 fund. If the authority denies the application, the notice must 5 include the reasons for the denial. If the authority approves 6 the application, the growth fund is deemed to have exited the 7 program on the date the notice is sent by the authority to the 8 growth fund. If the growth fund owes the state reimbursement, 9 the growth fund is prohibited from making any distributions to 10 equity holders of the fund until the state reimbursement amount 11 has been remitted to the authority. âEquity holderâ is defined 12 in the bill as a person that makes a credit-eligible capital 13 contribution, an equity investment, or a cash investment in 14 a rural business growth fund. The bill specifies that all 15 state reimbursement amounts remitted to the authority shall be 16 deposited in the general fund of the state. 17 Unless a growth fund has exited the program, the growth 18 fund must submit an annual report to the authority that 19 covers the preceding calendar year. The report must include 20 documentation for each of the growth fundâs growth investments 21 and must include financial statements that provide evidence 22 of each growth investment, evidence that the growth fund is 23 in compliance with applicable investment requirements; the 24 name, location, and industry for each qualified business that 25 received a growth investment; evidence that each business met 26 the requirements to be a qualified business at the time the 27 growth investment was made; the number of employees at each 28 qualified business on the date of the growth fundâs initial 29 growth investment; the number of jobs created at each qualified 30 business; the average annual salary for the jobs created; the 31 number of jobs retained at each qualified business; and the 32 average annual salary for the jobs retained. 33 The bill provides that the only remedies for a breach or 34 default of any of the terms of the program by a growth fund 35 -21- LSB 2290XS (2) 91 jm/jh 21/ 22 S.F. 270 are revocation or recapture of tax credits and the state 1 reimbursement as detailed in the bill. 2 The bill requires the authority, in conjunction with the 3 department, to adopt rules as necessary to implement and 4 administer the program. 5 -22- LSB 2290XS (2) 91 jm/jh 22/ 22
