11 section 277.20. In each county whose commissioner of elections
12 is the controlling commissioner for a merged area under section

14 second Monday or Tuesday after the day of the election to
15 canvass the abstracts of votes cast from each county in the
16 merged area, and declare the results of the voting. The
17 commissioner shall at once issue certificates of election to
18 each person declared elected, and shall certify to the merged
19 area board in substantially the manner prescribed by section
20 50.27 the result of the voting on any public question submitted
21 to the voters of the merged area. Members elected to the board
22 of directors of a merged area shall qualify by taking the oath

25 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
26 EXPLANATION
27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
28 the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
29 This bill relates to the conduct of election recounts.
30 The bill changes the composition of recount boards based
31 on the population of the county. For a county of fewer than
32 15,000, the board shall consist of a designee of the candidate
33 requesting the recount, a designee of the apparent winning
34 candidate, and a person who is a precinct election official
35 selected by the chief judge of the judicial district in which
LSB 1420XD (2) 91

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 the canvass occurs. For a county with a population between
2 15,000 and 49,999, the board shall consist of a designee of the
3 candidate requesting the recount, a designee of the apparent
4 winning candidate, and three persons who are precinct election
5 officials selected by the chief judge of the judicial district
6 in which the canvass occurs. For a county with a population
7 of 50,000 or greater, the board shall consist of two designees
8 of the candidate requesting the recount, two designees of the
9 apparent winning candidate, and three persons who are precinct
10 election officials selected by the chief judge of the judicial
11 district in which the canvass occurs. Members appointed by
12 the chief judge for the recount of a partisan election shall
13 not be comprised of more than one-third of persons who are not
14 members of either of the two political parties whose candidates
15 for president received the most or next-most votes at the last
16 general election for a partisan election and not more than a
17 simple majority of members appointed by a chief judge shall be
18 from the same political party or organization.
19 The bill allows the state commissioner of elections to call
20 for a recount of any election and to advise election recount
21 boards.
22 The bill removes the first and second Monday after an
23 election as a possible date for canvassing an election.
24 The bill requires a county board of canvassers to order a
25 recount in all election districts in a county for a particular
26 office or nomination if a request for a recount is filed with
27 the commissioner of that county not later than 5:00 p.m. on the
28 second day following the board’s canvass of the election. The
29 bill requires the state commissioner of elections to order a
30 recount of the votes cast for a statewide office, a seat in
31 the United States Congress, or electors for president or vice
32 president, or nominations for such offices, in each county
33 specified in a written request if the request is filed with the
34 state commissioner not later than 5:00 p.m. on the second day
35 following the county canvass of the election in question. If

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 automatic tabulating equipment was used to tabulate ballots in
2 the precinct, a request for a recount shall indicate whether
3 the recount shall be conducted using only automated tabulating
4 equipment or by hand. The bill requires the candidate to
5 request the same method of recounting in all counties in which
6 the candidate requests a recount. The state commissioner
7 of elections shall assess a civil penalty of $100 against a
8 candidate for each county in which the candidate was required
9 to request a hand recount but did not. The bill requires the
10 penalty to first be deducted from the recount bond paid by the
11 candidate and to be deposited in the general fund of the state.
12 The bill allows a candidate to withdraw a request for a recount
13 within 24 hours of the completion of an administrative audit
14 by a commissioner.
15 The bill requires a recount board to be convened no later
16 than 9:00 a.m. on the sixth day following the canvass of
17 the election. The commissioner shall then inform the board
18 whether the candidate requested a hand recount. The board
19 shall direct the commissioner to retabulate the ballots using
20 the automatic tabulating equipment using the same program as
21 was used to tabulate the votes on election day unless the
22 program is believed or known to be flawed. The board shall
23 recount only the ballots which were voted and counted for
24 the office in question, including disputed ballots. After
25 retabulating, the board shall compare the results to the
26 abstract prepared pursuant to the county board’s canvass and
27 note any discrepancies. If the candidate requested a hand
28 recount, the bill requires the ballots to be separated into
29 categories and tabulated. The board shall then compare the
30 results of the tabulation to the results of the canvass and the
31 automatic recount. If there are discrepancies, the results of
32 the hand recount shall control. The bill then requires the
33 board to reseal and preserve the ballots.
34 The bill requires an election recount board to file its
35 report by 17 days after the canvass of an election for the
LSB 1420XD (2) 91

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 offices of president and vice president, by 21 days after the
2 canvass of an election for a state office or a seat in the
3 United States Congress, and by 13 days after the canvass of any
4 other election. The bill also requires a county commissioner
5 of elections to notify the state commissioner when the county
6 commissioner receives a recount request for any office elected
7 by the residents of more than one county. Upon verification
8 that a candidate requested a hand count in at least one but
9 not all counties where a recount was requested, the bill also
10 requires the state commissioner to inform each commissioner
11 of a county where a recount was requested that a hand recount
12 shall be performed.
13 The bill allows a candidate or person who requested a recount
14 to accept the results of the original canvass of the election,
15 which will cause the election recount board to cease its work.
16 The bill requires a petition for a recount of an election
17 for a public measure to be submitted not later than two days
18 following the canvass of the votes for the measure rather
19 than three days. The bill changes the makeup of the recount
20 board for a public measure by removing a designee named by the
21 commissioner and a person jointly selected by that person and
22 a designee named in the petition requesting the recount and
23 replacing them with two election officials selected by the
24 chief judge of the judicial district where the canvass occurs.
25 The commissioner shall convene the recount board not later than
26 9:00 a.m. on the sixth day following the county board’s canvass
27 of the election in question.
28 Under current law, a county commissioner of elections may
29 conduct an administrative recount if the commissioner suspects
30 that voting equipment used in the election malfunctioned or
31 that programming errors may have affected the outcome of the
32 election, or if the precinct election officials report counting
33 errors to the commissioner. The bill instead allows the county
34 commissioner of elections to conduct an administrative audit if
35 such circumstances exist. The bill allows political parties,
LSB 1420XD (2) 91

1 as defined in Code, to appoint observers to witness the audit.
2 The bill changes the clerk of a court of contest for
3 presidential electors and congresspersons from the secretary
4 of state to the clerk of the supreme court. If the clerk of
5 the supreme court is absent or unable to act, the secretary of
6 state shall be the clerk of the court. For elections for state
7 officers, the bill changes the clerk of a contest court to the
8 clerk of the supreme court. If the clerk of the supreme court
9 is absent or unable to act, the secretary of state shall be the
10 clerk of the court. However, if the secretary of state is a
11 party to the contest, the auditor of state shall be the clerk
12 of the court.
13 The bill takes effect upon enactment.
