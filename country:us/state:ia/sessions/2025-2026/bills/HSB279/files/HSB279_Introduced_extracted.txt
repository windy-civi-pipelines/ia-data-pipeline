This bill provides for the regulation of hemp, 9 including hemp products. The regulation of hemp production 10 is governed by federal law. Hemp must have a maximum 11 concentration of the compound delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol 12 (THC) not exceeding three-tenths of 1 percent as measured on a 13 dry weight basis. A plant or a product manufactured from that 14 plant exceeding the concentration limit is no longer classified 15 as hemp and instead is regulated as a controlled substance 16 under Code chapters 124 and 453B, which include criminal 17 offenses. 18 The regulation of hemp has been divided between the 19 production, harvesting, storage, and transportation of raw 20 hemp and the manufacture and sale of hemp products, including 21 consumable hemp products. Prior to 2024, the department 22 of agriculture and land stewardship (DALS) was required to 23 regulate hemp. In 2024 Iowa Acts, chapter 1177, the United 24 States department of agriculture (USDA) assumed regulation 25 over the production of hemp including the issuance of licenses 26 to growers, and remaining state regulatory provisions were 27 transferred from Code chapter 204 to Code chapter 204A. Certain 28 state regulations continue to apply to hemp. A person is 29 required to hold a certificate of analysis (COA) to possess, 30 handle, use, manufacture, market, transport, deliver, or 31 distribute hemp (Code section 204.7). A COA is evidence 32 that hemp originates from a legal source (e.g., a licenseeâs 33 production site). 34 The department of health and human services (HHS) regulates 35 -11- LSB 2611YC (5) 91 da/ns 11/ 14 H.F. _____ the manufacture and sale of hemp products under Code chapter 1 204. Generally, HHS regulations are concerned with consumable 2 hemp products that are metabolized or otherwise subject to 3 a biotransformative process when introduced into the human 4 body. HHS must register any person manufacturing or selling a 5 consumable hemp product on a retail basis (Code section 204.7). 6 Many of the regulations covering consumable hemp products have 7 been adopted by rule (641 IAC 156). In general, consumable 8 hemp products are regulated according to milligrams (mg) per 9 amount or volume (often per serving, per milliliter (ml), or 10 per ounce (oz)). 11 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ ADMINISTRATION BY HHS. The bill 12 provides that HHS may adopt rules only to the extent that the 13 rules are necessary to comply with administrative procedures 14 or the health and safety of the public. In addition, the 15 rules must be supported by scientific evidence. During the 16 rulemaking process, 60 days must be set aside for public 17 comment. HHS must establish and administer continuing 18 education programs for its staff covering the regulation of 19 hemp and hemp products. HHS, in cooperation with DALS, must 20 establish and administer outreach programs regarding the 21 regulation of hemp and hemp products. HHS, in cooperation with 22 DALS and the department of revenue, must prepare and submit an 23 annual report to the governor and general assembly summarizing 24 information regarding the production and regulation of hemp and 25 hemp growers licensed by USDA, and information regarding the 26 manufacture and sale of hemp products, including consumable 27 hemp products, by registrants. 28 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ REGULATION BY HHS ââ SERVING. The 29 bill amends a provision that describes when a hemp product is 30 considered to be a consumable hemp product, including when 31 its maximum total THC is less than or equal to four mg per 32 serving and 10 mg per container on a dry weight basis. The bill 33 increases the mg per serving to five and eliminates the per 34 container measurement. 35 -12- LSB 2611YC (5) 91 da/ns 12/ 14 H.F. _____ BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ REGULATION BY HHS ââ COA. The 1 bill provides that a valid COA held by a consumable hemp 2 establishment is valid for the shelf life of the consumable 3 hemp product covered by the COA. 4 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ REGULATION BY HHS ââ THC LIMITS. 5 The bill imposes maximum limits on certain consumable hemp 6 products, including a consumable hemp product in the form of 7 a tincture (1 mg), a beverage other than a tincture (10 mg per 8 12 oz), and a topical application (1,000 mg per package). The 9 bill provides that a consumable hemp product cannot exceed 10 10 mg per serving if the consumable hemp product is manufactured 11 in this state for distribution outside this state. 12 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ REGULATION BY HHS ââ PACKAGING AND 13 ADVERTISING. The bill provides that a person preparing a 14 consumable product in its final package form must comply with a 15 number of requirements regarding safety, including providing 16 for child resistant safeguards, the separation of servings, 17 the inclusion of a dropper if necessary, label requirements, 18 and a 30-day supply limit. The bill prohibits a person from 19 engaging in deceptive advertising, including by stating that 20 the consumable hemp product is medical cannabidiol. The bill 21 prohibits a person from engaging in intellectual property 22 infringement (e.g., a violation of a trademark), or from 23 presenting a consumable hemp product in a manner that bears a 24 resemblance to a recognizable food product or a manner that is 25 attractive to children. 26 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ REGULATION BY HHS ââ LOCATIONS. 27 According to administrative rule, a consumable hemp 28 registration is restricted to one physical location (641 IAC 29 156.2). The bill provides HHS must allow a person to engage 30 in the retail sale of consumable hemp products under the same 31 registration if the person has been engaged in the retail sale 32 of consumable hemp products for two years without violation, 33 the person maintains the first location as the principal place 34 of residence, and the second location is maintained on a 35 -13- LSB 2611YC (5) 91 da/ns 13/ 14 H.F. _____ temporary or mobile basis. 1 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ REGULATION BY HHS ââ USE BY PERSONS 2 UNDER THE AGE OF 21. The bill amends a provision that 3 prohibits a person under 21 years of age to consume, possess, 4 or purchase a consumable hemp product (Code section 204.12E). 5 The bill provides an exception if the action is approved by a 6 mental health professional. 7 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ APPLICABLE PENALTIES. Generally, a 8 person engaged in the retail sale of a consumable hemp product 9 without being registered is subject to a civil penalty of not 10 more than $10,000 with each day of a violation considered as 11 a separate offense (Code section 204.14B). A person who is 12 unregistered and a person who is engaged in the retail sale 13 of an item wrongly advertised as a consumable hemp product 14 commits a serious misdemeanor. The bill provides that a 15 person who distributes a consumable hemp product to a person 16 under 21 years of age is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code 17 section 204.14D). A person under that age limit who consumes, 18 possesses, or attempts to purchase or purchases a consumable 19 hemp product is subject to a scheduled violation ranging from 20 $70 to $325 (Code section 204.14E). A simple misdemeanor is 21 punishable by confinement for no more than 30 days and a fine 22 of at least $105 but not more than $855. A serious misdemeanor 23 is punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a 24 fine of at least $430 but not more than $2,560. 25 -14- LSB 2611YC (5) 91 da/ns 14/ 14

This bill provides for the regulation of hemp, 9 including hemp products. The regulation of hemp production 10 is governed by federal law. Hemp must have a maximum 11 concentration of the compound delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol 12 (THC) not exceeding three-tenths of 1 percent as measured on a 13 dry weight basis. A plant or a product manufactured from that 14 plant exceeding the concentration limit is no longer classified 15 as hemp and instead is regulated as a controlled substance 16 under Code chapters 124 and 453B, which include criminal 17 offenses. 18 The regulation of hemp has been divided between the 19 production, harvesting, storage, and transportation of raw 20 hemp and the manufacture and sale of hemp products, including 21 consumable hemp products. Prior to 2024, the department 22 of agriculture and land stewardship (DALS) was required to 23 regulate hemp. In 2024 Iowa Acts, chapter 1177, the United 24 States department of agriculture (USDA) assumed regulation 25 over the production of hemp including the issuance of licenses 26 to growers, and remaining state regulatory provisions were 27 transferred from Code chapter 204 to Code chapter 204A. Certain 28 state regulations continue to apply to hemp. A person is 29 required to hold a certificate of analysis (COA) to possess, 30 handle, use, manufacture, market, transport, deliver, or 31 distribute hemp (Code section 204.7). A COA is evidence 32 that hemp originates from a legal source (e.g., a licenseeâs 33 production site). 34 The department of health and human services (HHS) regulates 35 -11- LSB 2611YC (5) 91 da/ns 11/ 14 H.F. _____ the manufacture and sale of hemp products under Code chapter 1 204. Generally, HHS regulations are concerned with consumable 2 hemp products that are metabolized or otherwise subject to 3 a biotransformative process when introduced into the human 4 body. HHS must register any person manufacturing or selling a 5 consumable hemp product on a retail basis (Code section 204.7). 6 Many of the regulations covering consumable hemp products have 7 been adopted by rule (641 IAC 156). In general, consumable 8 hemp products are regulated according to milligrams (mg) per 9 amount or volume (often per serving, per milliliter (ml), or 10 per ounce (oz)). 11 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ ADMINISTRATION BY HHS. The bill 12 provides that HHS may adopt rules only to the extent that the 13 rules are necessary to comply with administrative procedures 14 or the health and safety of the public. In addition, the 15 rules must be supported by scientific evidence. During the 16 rulemaking process, 60 days must be set aside for public 17 comment. HHS must establish and administer continuing 18 education programs for its staff covering the regulation of 19 hemp and hemp products. HHS, in cooperation with DALS, must 20 establish and administer outreach programs regarding the 21 regulation of hemp and hemp products. HHS, in cooperation with 22 DALS and the department of revenue, must prepare and submit an 23 annual report to the governor and general assembly summarizing 24 information regarding the production and regulation of hemp and 25 hemp growers licensed by USDA, and information regarding the 26 manufacture and sale of hemp products, including consumable 27 hemp products, by registrants. 28 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ REGULATION BY HHS ââ SERVING. The 29 bill amends a provision that describes when a hemp product is 30 considered to be a consumable hemp product, including when 31 its maximum total THC is less than or equal to four mg per 32 serving and 10 mg per container on a dry weight basis. The bill 33 increases the mg per serving to five and eliminates the per 34 container measurement. 35 -12- LSB 2611YC (5) 91 da/ns 12/ 14 H.F. _____ BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ REGULATION BY HHS ââ COA. The 1 bill provides that a valid COA held by a consumable hemp 2 establishment is valid for the shelf life of the consumable 3 hemp product covered by the COA. 4 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ REGULATION BY HHS ââ THC LIMITS. 5 The bill imposes maximum limits on certain consumable hemp 6 products, including a consumable hemp product in the form of 7 a tincture (1 mg), a beverage other than a tincture (10 mg per 8 12 oz), and a topical application (1,000 mg per package). The 9 bill provides that a consumable hemp product cannot exceed 10 10 mg per serving if the consumable hemp product is manufactured 11 in this state for distribution outside this state. 12 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ REGULATION BY HHS ââ PACKAGING AND 13 ADVERTISING. The bill provides that a person preparing a 14 consumable product in its final package form must comply with a 15 number of requirements regarding safety, including providing 16 for child resistant safeguards, the separation of servings, 17 the inclusion of a dropper if necessary, label requirements, 18 and a 30-day supply limit. The bill prohibits a person from 19 engaging in deceptive advertising, including by stating that 20 the consumable hemp product is medical cannabidiol. The bill 21 prohibits a person from engaging in intellectual property 22 infringement (e.g., a violation of a trademark), or from 23 presenting a consumable hemp product in a manner that bears a 24 resemblance to a recognizable food product or a manner that is 25 attractive to children. 26 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ REGULATION BY HHS ââ LOCATIONS. 27 According to administrative rule, a consumable hemp 28 registration is restricted to one physical location (641 IAC 29 156.2). The bill provides HHS must allow a person to engage 30 in the retail sale of consumable hemp products under the same 31 registration if the person has been engaged in the retail sale 32 of consumable hemp products for two years without violation, 33 the person maintains the first location as the principal place 34 of residence, and the second location is maintained on a 35 -13- LSB 2611YC (5) 91 da/ns 13/ 14 H.F. _____ temporary or mobile basis. 1 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ REGULATION BY HHS ââ USE BY PERSONS 2 UNDER THE AGE OF 21. The bill amends a provision that 3 prohibits a person under 21 years of age to consume, possess, 4 or purchase a consumable hemp product (Code section 204.12E). 5 The bill provides an exception if the action is approved by a 6 mental health professional. 7 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ APPLICABLE PENALTIES. Generally, a 8 person engaged in the retail sale of a consumable hemp product 9 without being registered is subject to a civil penalty of not 10 more than $10,000 with each day of a violation considered as 11 a separate offense (Code section 204.14B). A person who is 12 unregistered and a person who is engaged in the retail sale 13 of an item wrongly advertised as a consumable hemp product 14 commits a serious misdemeanor. The bill provides that a 15 person who distributes a consumable hemp product to a person 16 under 21 years of age is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code 17 section 204.14D). A person under that age limit who consumes, 18 possesses, or attempts to purchase or purchases a consumable 19 hemp product is subject to a scheduled violation ranging from 20 $70 to $325 (Code section 204.14E). A simple misdemeanor is 21 punishable by confinement for no more than 30 days and a fine 22 of at least $105 but not more than $855. A serious misdemeanor 23 is punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a 24 fine of at least $430 but not more than $2,560. 25 -14- LSB 2611YC (5) 91 da/ns 14/ 14
