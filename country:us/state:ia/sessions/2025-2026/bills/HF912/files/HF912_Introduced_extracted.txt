This 27 division requires a state agency to give preference to a 28 veteran over another applicant of similar qualifications for 29 the award of a grant that is overseen, implemented, or funded 30 by the state. 31 DIVISION II ââ VETERAN PREFERENCE ââ PUBLIC ASSISTANCE 32 PROGRAMS. This division requires the state to provide 33 veterans who are citizens and residents of the United States 34 a preference for assistance programs including but not 35 -17- LSB 1958HV (2) 91 sc/js 17/ 24 H.F. 912 limited to public assistance, the family investment program, 1 the supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and 2 children, the state child care assistance program, and the 3 United States department of housing and urban development 4 housing choice voucher program. 5 DIVISION III ââ BUSINESS FEE WAIVERS. 6 BACKGROUND (BUSINESS ENTITIES). A business entity is a 7 general term for an association formed to conduct business 8 under several types of organizational structures recognized 9 by law (e.g., partnership and limited partnership, business 10 and nonprofit corporation, limited liability company, and 11 cooperative). Generally, a business entity may be formed as 12 a domestic business entity in its home state or as a foreign 13 business entity doing business in a state although it was 14 formed in another home state. In Iowa, a business entity is 15 governed under its own dedicated Code chapter, often based 16 on model legislation with fee amounts reserved for decision 17 by the enacting body. In Iowa, like most states, a business 18 entity is under the general authority of the secretary of state 19 (secretary). 20 SUMMARY. This division provides that a qualified business 21 entity that requests and receives a military service filing fee 22 waiver (waiver) from the secretary is not required to submit 23 a fee for filing a number of select documents. The division 24 specifies qualifications for a business entity, eligibility 25 for the filer of a select document, and the names of select 26 documents having fees waived, subject to further requirements 27 that the secretary may adopt by rule. 28 STATUTORY ORGANIZATION. The division amends Code chapter 29 9 establishing the secretaryâs office. Specifically, it 30 enacts new provisions in subchapter II of that Code chapter 31 which currently includes provisions authorizing extra filing 32 services. It also amends various Code chapters each of which 33 governs a specific type of business entity. The division 34 amends the principal Code section in each such Code chapter 35 -18- LSB 1958HV (2) 91 sc/js 18/ 24 H.F. 912 that includes a laundry list of fees for filing documents. 1 IN DETAIL ââ QUALIFIED BUSINESS ENTITIES. First, in order 2 to receive a waiver, the business entity must be qualified, 3 meaning that the waiver is limited to a domestic or foreign 4 limited partnership (Code chapter 488); domestic or foreign 5 limited liability company (Code chapter 489); domestic or 6 foreign business corporation (Code chapter 490); and domestic 7 or foreign nonprofit corporation (Code chapter 504). 8 IN DETAIL ââ ELIGIBLE FILERS. Second, an individual 9 acting on behalf of the qualified business entity must meet 10 eligibility criteria. The individual must sign the document; 11 must be an interest holder in the qualified business entity; 12 and must be serving in the United States armed forces, the 13 national guard or organized reserves, the United States coast 14 guard, or the civil air patrol, or alternatively must be a 15 veteran. 16 IN DETAIL ââ SELECT DOCUMENTS FOR FILING. Third, the 17 filed document must be selected to receive the waiver. A 18 select document may include those associated with the business 19 entityâs organization, name, registered agent or registered 20 office, domestication or conversion, merger, dissolution or 21 reinstatement, foreign registration, correction, validation, 22 biennial report, or other document required or permitted to be 23 filed. The amount of the fee ranges from $5 to $100. 24 EFFECTIVE DATE. This division takes effect January 1, 2026. 25 DIVISION IV ââ SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PROGRAMS ââ MENTAL 26 HEALTH AND DISABILITY SERVICES. This division requires 27 each facility licensed under Code chapter 125 (substance use 28 disorders) that maintains a wait list for care, maintenance, or 29 treatment of persons with a substance use disorder to place a 30 veteran on the wait list in a position that allows the veteran 31 priority for acceptance into the treatment program before any 32 person on the wait list who is not a veteran, but after each 33 veteran currently on the wait list. 34 The division requires each service provider operating 35 -19- LSB 1958HV (2) 91 sc/js 19/ 24 H.F. 912 through the mental health and disability services regional 1 service system that maintains a wait list for mental health or 2 disability services to place a veteran on the wait list in a 3 position that allows the veteran to receive the services before 4 any person on the wait list who is not a veteran, but after each 5 veteran currently on the wait list. 6 DIVISION V ââ WAIVER OF UNDERGRADUATE TUITION AND MANDATORY 7 FEES. This division requires the state board of regents to 8 adopt rules that waive undergraduate tuition and mandatory fees 9 for veterans, or a dependent of the veteran, while the veteran 10 or dependent is enrolled in an institution of higher education 11 under the boardâs control, if the veteran was a resident of 12 this state immediately prior to joining the armed forces of 13 the United States, was discharged under honorable conditions, 14 and resides in this state immediately prior to applying to 15 enroll, or prior to the dependent applying to enroll, in the 16 institution. 17 The division provides that the rules shall not waive 18 an amount of tuition and mandatory fees that exceeds the 19 difference between the combined amount of tuition and mandatory 20 fees charged by the institution less any federal financial aid 21 award the veteran or dependent receives. 22 The division defines âdependentâ to mean the spouse or child 23 of a veteran. The division defines âveteranâ by reference to 24 Code section 35.1. 25 DIVISION VI ââ DRIVERâS LICENSE ââ VETERAN STATUS ââ FEES. 26 This division of the bill relates to driverâs licenses issued 27 to veterans. 28 Current law requires the department of transportation (DOT) 29 to mark a driverâs license with the word âVETERANâ if the 30 applicant is a qualifying veteran. Under Code section 321.189, 31 a licensee must be an honorably discharged veteran of the armed 32 forces of the United States to qualify for a veteran status 33 license. The DOT has adopted administrative rules defining 34 âveteranâ for purposes of licensees requesting a veteran status 35 -20- LSB 1958HV (2) 91 sc/js 20/ 24 H.F. 912 license (761 IAC 605.5(7)(e)). The bill strikes certain 1 existing service qualifications and instead references the 2 definition of âveteranâ provided in Code section 35.1. 3 Under current law, the DOT is prohibited from charging a fee 4 to issue a noncommercial driverâs license or license valid for 5 motorcycles to an applicant who is a veteran with a permanent 6 service-connected disability rating of 100 percent, as 7 certified by the United States department of veterans affairs. 8 The bill prohibits the DOT from charging a fee to issue a 9 noncommercial driverâs license ($4 per year of validity), 10 license for chauffeurs ($8 per year of validity), commercial 11 driverâs license ($8 per year of license validity), or license 12 valid for motorcycles (an additional fee of $2 per year of 13 validity) to a veteran, as defined in Code section 35.1. 14 DIVISION VII ââ VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEES ââ VETERANS 15 EXEMPT. This division of the bill relates to registration fees 16 for vehicles owned by veterans. 17 Current law exempts seriously disabled veterans who have 18 been provided with an automobile or other vehicle by the United 19 States government from paying motor vehicle registration fees. 20 The bill exempts all other veterans who reside in Iowa from 21 paying annual vehicle registration fees for not more than three 22 vehicles registered by the veteran, and provides for one free 23 set of regular registration plates for each vehicle. In lieu 24 of the set of regular registration plates available without 25 fee, a veteran may obtain a set of special registration plates 26 or personalized registration plates by paying the additional 27 fees associated with those plates under current law. Under 28 current law, several special registration plates relating to 29 service in the armed forces are available at no charge to 30 eligible persons. 31 DIVISION VIII ââ DISABLED VETERANS PROPERTY TAX CREDIT. 32 This division creates a property tax credit for certain 33 veterans. 34 The division defines âqualifying veteranâ as a person who 35 -21- LSB 1958HV (2) 91 sc/js 21/ 24 H.F. 912 meets the definition of a veteran under Code section 35.1 1 (veterans affairs), and has a disability rating of 20 percent 2 or more as certified by the United States department of 3 veterans affairs. 4 The division allows a qualifying veteran a credit on each 5 property that is owned solely by the qualifying veteran or 6 jointly by the qualifying veteran and the qualifying veteranâs 7 spouse. The amount of the credit on a property is equal to the 8 property tax owed on the property multiplied by the disability 9 rating given to the qualifying veteran as certified by the 10 United States department of veterans affairs, up to a maximum 11 reduction of $10,000 per property. 12 The division allows the credit to continue until the later to 13 occur between the qualifying veteranâs death and the earlier to 14 occur between the qualifying veteranâs surviving spouseâs death 15 or remarriage. 16 Except upon a county veterans service officerâs request for 17 the purposes of providing information on benefits and services 18 available to veterans and their families, the bill makes 19 confidential the list of the names and addresses of individuals 20 allowed a credit under the bill and maintained by the county 21 recorder, county treasurer, county assessor, city assessor, or 22 other government body. The bill prohibits this information 23 from being disseminated to any person unless otherwise ordered 24 by a court or released by the lawful custodian of the records 25 pursuant to state or federal law. The county recorder, county 26 treasurer, county assessor, city assessor, or other government 27 body responsible for maintaining the names and addresses 28 of individuals allowed a credit may display the credit on 29 individual paper records and individual electronic records, 30 including display on an internet site. 31 The division requires the department of revenue, the 32 department of administrative services, county auditors, county 33 treasurers, and assessors to administer the disabled veteran 34 tax credit in a manner similar to the military service tax 35 -22- LSB 1958HV (2) 91 sc/js 22/ 24 H.F. 912 credit and exemptions in Code chapter 426A. 1 The division makes any person who makes a false affidavit 2 for the purpose of obtaining the disabled veteran tax credit 3 or who knowingly receives the credit without being legally 4 entitled to the credit guilty of a fraudulent practice. A 5 fraudulent practice is punishable based on the amount of value 6 involved, and may range from a simple misdemeanor punishable 7 by confinement for no more than 30 days and a fine of at least 8 $105 but not more than $855, to a class âCâ felony punishable 9 by confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of at least 10 $1,370 but not more than $13,660. 11 The division appropriates from the general fund of the state 12 amounts necessary to fund the disabled veteran tax credit. 13 DIVISION IX ââ DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES ââ LICENSES 14 AND FEES. This division prohibits the department of natural 15 resources from requiring a veteran to pay a fee for camping 16 and using rental facilities at state parks and recreation 17 areas. A veteran who applies to register a vessel for use 18 in Iowa waters shall not be assessed a fee to receive the 19 registration certificate. A veteran applying for any hunting, 20 fur harvester, or fishing license is not required to pay the 21 license fee nor the wildlife habitat fee, if applicable. A 22 veteran who was disabled or was a prisoner of war shall not be 23 assessed a fee in applying for a lifetime fishing license and a 24 lifetime hunting and fishing combined license. A veteran may 25 also obtain a lifetime trout fishing license without paying a 26 fee if the veteran is at least 65 years of age or qualifies for 27 the disabled veteran homestead credit, and the department of 28 natural resources shall not require any veteran to pay a trout 29 fishing fee. The department of veteran affairs shall assist 30 the department of natural resources in verifying the status and 31 claims of the veterans applying for recreational privileges for 32 which fees are generally required. 33 DIVISION X ââ PERMIT TO CARRY WEAPONS FEES. This division 34 exempts a veteran who has a service-connected disability from 35 -23- LSB 1958HV (2) 91 sc/js 23/ 24 H.F. 912 paying a fee for a permit to carry weapons. An initial permit 1 has a fee of $50 and a renewal permit or duplicate permit has 2 a fee of $25. 3 -24- LSB 1958HV (2) 91 sc/js 24/ 24

A business entity is a 7 general term for an association formed to conduct business 8 under several types of organizational structures recognized 9 by law (e.g., partnership and limited partnership, business 10 and nonprofit corporation, limited liability company, and 11 cooperative). Generally, a business entity may be formed as 12 a domestic business entity in its home state or as a foreign 13 business entity doing business in a state although it was 14 formed in another home state. In Iowa, a business entity is 15 governed under its own dedicated Code chapter, often based 16 on model legislation with fee amounts reserved for decision 17 by the enacting body. In Iowa, like most states, a business 18 entity is under the general authority of the secretary of state 19 (secretary). 20 SUMMARY. This division provides that a qualified business 21 entity that requests and receives a military service filing fee 22 waiver (waiver) from the secretary is not required to submit 23 a fee for filing a number of select documents. The division 24 specifies qualifications for a business entity, eligibility 25 for the filer of a select document, and the names of select 26 documents having fees waived, subject to further requirements 27 that the secretary may adopt by rule. 28 STATUTORY ORGANIZATION. The division amends Code chapter 29 9 establishing the secretaryâs office. Specifically, it 30 enacts new provisions in subchapter II of that Code chapter 31 which currently includes provisions authorizing extra filing 32 services. It also amends various Code chapters each of which 33 governs a specific type of business entity. The division 34 amends the principal Code section in each such Code chapter 35 -18- LSB 1958HV (2) 91 sc/js 18/ 24 H.F. 912 that includes a laundry list of fees for filing documents. 1 IN DETAIL ââ QUALIFIED BUSINESS ENTITIES.

Second, an individual 9 acting on behalf of the qualified business entity must meet 10 eligibility criteria. The individual must sign the document; 11 must be an interest holder in the qualified business entity; 12 and must be serving in the United States armed forces, the 13 national guard or organized reserves, the United States coast 14 guard, or the civil air patrol, or alternatively must be a 15 veteran. 16 IN DETAIL ââ SELECT DOCUMENTS FOR FILING. Third, the 17 filed document must be selected to receive the waiver.
