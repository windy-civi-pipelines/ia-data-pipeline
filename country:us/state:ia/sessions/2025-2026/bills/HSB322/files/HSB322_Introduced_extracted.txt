NEW SECTION . 459B.105 Digestates. 35 -32- LSB 2958YC (6) 91 da/ns 32/ 36 H.F. _____ This chapter does not apply to digestates processed at a 1 community anaerobic digester system as regulated in chapter 2 458. 3 EXPLANATION 4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 5 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 6 GENERAL. This bill provides for the regulation of a 7 community anaerobic digester system (system) by the department 8 of natural resources (DNR) which must include a digester 9 processing structure that primarily processes manure but may 10 also process other organic feedstocks. The system produces 11 a biogas which is a source of renewable fuel and a digestate 12 which is a nutrient-rich material that may be applied to 13 cropland. 14 TERMINOLOGY. The bill provides for the regulation of 15 off-farm systems. âOn-farmâ refers to real property used to 16 produce agricultural animals or crops as compared to âoff-farmâ 17 which refers to real property other than on-farm. Once 18 manure or feedstock is received by the system, the manure is 19 referred to as digester manure and the feedstock is referred 20 to as digester feedstock. The off-farm system receives 21 on-farm manure and either on-farm or off-farm feedstock. The 22 digester manure or digester feedstock is subject to storage 23 requirements. Different regulations apply to digester 24 feedstock or digester manure that is dry or liquid. Digester 25 manure or digester feedstock is classified as dry only if the 26 digester manure or digester feedstock does not flow perceptibly 27 under pressure, is not capable of being transported through 28 a mechanical pumping device designed to move a liquid, and 29 consists of molecules that do not flow freely among themselves. 30 Generally, liquid digester manure and liquid digester feedstock 31 must be stored in a liquid digester storage structure. Dry 32 digester manure or dry digester feedstock must be stored as 33 a dry digester stockpile or in a liquid digester storage 34 structure. The digester manure or digester feedstock is used 35 -33- LSB 2958YC (6) 91 da/ns 33/ 36 H.F. _____ by a digester processing structure to produce biogas and a 1 digestate. A digester processing structure must process manure 2 as its primary source. Digestate is also referred to as dry 3 or liquid based on the same criteria used for digester manure 4 and digester feedstock. Liquid digestate is stored in a liquid 5 digestate storage structure and dry digestate is stored as a 6 stockpile or in a liquid digestate storage structure. The 7 scope of the bill is limited to the off-farm construction, 8 including expansion, of digester structures on the site of the 9 system, the off-farm stockpiling of dry digester manure or 10 feedstock on the site of the system, the off-farm storage and 11 stockpiling of digestate on the site of the system, the removal 12 of the digestate from the off-farm site of the system, and 13 the on-farm storage and application of the removed digestate. 14 Any reference in the bill to a digester structure means a 15 covered liquid digester storage structure, a covered digester 16 processing structure, or a covered liquid digestate storage 17 structure. Any reference to a digester stockpile refers to a 18 dry digester manure or feedstock stockpile or a dry digestate 19 stockpile. 20 REGULATION. The bill provides that a system cannot be 21 identified with an animal feeding operation where animals are 22 confined and fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any 23 12-month period. Identification occurs only if the system 24 and the animal feeding operation are both (1) under common 25 ownership or management and (2) adjacent. 26 CONSTRUCTION. The bill provides that a construction 27 permit must be issued by DNR prior to the construction 28 of a digester structure. The requirements for a permit 29 are based on permit requirements for the construction of 30 manure storage structures. The application must include an 31 engineering report, construction plans, and specifications 32 prepared by a professional engineer. The bill provides 33 for an application fee not to exceed $1,000. The bill also 34 provides for construction design standards for a formed 35 -34- LSB 2958YC (6) 91 da/ns 34/ 36 H.F. _____ or unformed digester structure. The construction design 1 standards must be based on uniform standards such as available 2 standards promulgated by ASTM (American society for testing and 3 materials) international. The design standards for unformed 4 digester feedstock storage structures must account for the use 5 of linings and erosion controls. 6 SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS ââ AIR QUALITY. The bill 7 provides separation distance requirements as part of air 8 quality and water quality standards. Generally, the separation 9 distance requirements for air quality apply between a digester 10 structure and either a residence not owned by the owner of 11 the system or a designated object or location (commercial 12 enterprise, bona fide religious institution, educational 13 institution, public use area, or public thoroughfare). Other 14 separation distances apply to the stockpiling of dry digester 15 manure or feedstock, or digestate and those same designated 16 objects or locations. The bill also provides separation 17 distance requirements for air quality that apply between 18 the digestate application site and the designated object or 19 location. The separation distance requirements for air quality 20 also provide for certain exceptions, including a waiver by a 21 person benefiting from the separation distance. 22 SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS ââ WATER QUALITY. The 23 bill provides a number of separation distance requirements 24 between a digester structure and certain sources of water, 25 including an agricultural drainage well, known sinkhole, lake, 26 river, reservoir, creek, stream, or ditch. The bill provides 27 separation distance requirements between digestate stockpiles 28 and water sources, with exceptions that apply if measures are 29 taken to reduce runoff. Special restrictions are placed on a 30 stockpile located in karst terrain. The bill restricts the 31 application of dry digestate on snow covered or frozen ground. 32 DIGESTATE MANAGEMENT. The bill provides that if digestate 33 is applied on land subject to a manure management plan or 34 nutrient management plan, such plan must be attached with 35 -35- LSB 2958YC (6) 91 da/ns 35/ 36 H.F. _____ a second document referred to as a digestate management 1 supplement. The digestate management supplement must include 2 information necessary to determine the land area required 3 for the application of the digestate and the nutrient 4 concentrations of the digestate. Finally, it requires the 5 owner or manager of the system to maintain records regarding 6 the systemâs operation. 7 CIVIL PENALTIES. A person who violates an air quality 8 regulation or water quality regulation is subject to a civil 9 penalty based on a schedule established by DNR rule. The 10 civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000 per violation. The civil 11 penalty for a water quality violation may also be subject to 12 a judicial civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each day of 13 such violation. 14 -36- LSB 2958YC (6) 91 da/ns 36/ 36

This bill provides for the regulation of a 7 community anaerobic digester system (system) by the department 8 of natural resources (DNR) which must include a digester 9 processing structure that primarily processes manure but may 10 also process other organic feedstocks. The system produces 11 a biogas which is a source of renewable fuel and a digestate 12 which is a nutrient-rich material that may be applied to 13 cropland. 14 TERMINOLOGY. The bill provides for the regulation of 15 off-farm systems. âOn-farmâ refers to real property used to 16 produce agricultural animals or crops as compared to âoff-farmâ 17 which refers to real property other than on-farm. Once 18 manure or feedstock is received by the system, the manure is 19 referred to as digester manure and the feedstock is referred 20 to as digester feedstock. The off-farm system receives 21 on-farm manure and either on-farm or off-farm feedstock. The 22 digester manure or digester feedstock is subject to storage 23 requirements. Different regulations apply to digester 24 feedstock or digester manure that is dry or liquid. Digester 25 manure or digester feedstock is classified as dry only if the 26 digester manure or digester feedstock does not flow perceptibly 27 under pressure, is not capable of being transported through 28 a mechanical pumping device designed to move a liquid, and 29 consists of molecules that do not flow freely among themselves. 30 Generally, liquid digester manure and liquid digester feedstock 31 must be stored in a liquid digester storage structure. Dry 32 digester manure or dry digester feedstock must be stored as 33 a dry digester stockpile or in a liquid digester storage 34 structure. The digester manure or digester feedstock is used 35 -33- LSB 2958YC (6) 91 da/ns 33/ 36 H.F. _____ by a digester processing structure to produce biogas and a 1 digestate. A digester processing structure must process manure 2 as its primary source. Digestate is also referred to as dry 3 or liquid based on the same criteria used for digester manure 4 and digester feedstock. Liquid digestate is stored in a liquid 5 digestate storage structure and dry digestate is stored as a 6 stockpile or in a liquid digestate storage structure. The 7 scope of the bill is limited to the off-farm construction, 8 including expansion, of digester structures on the site of the 9 system, the off-farm stockpiling of dry digester manure or 10 feedstock on the site of the system, the off-farm storage and 11 stockpiling of digestate on the site of the system, the removal 12 of the digestate from the off-farm site of the system, and 13 the on-farm storage and application of the removed digestate. 14 Any reference in the bill to a digester structure means a 15 covered liquid digester storage structure, a covered digester 16 processing structure, or a covered liquid digestate storage 17 structure. Any reference to a digester stockpile refers to a 18 dry digester manure or feedstock stockpile or a dry digestate 19 stockpile. 20 REGULATION. The bill provides that a system cannot be 21 identified with an animal feeding operation where animals are 22 confined and fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any 23 12-month period. Identification occurs only if the system 24 and the animal feeding operation are both (1) under common 25 ownership or management and (2) adjacent. 26 CONSTRUCTION. The bill provides that a construction 27 permit must be issued by DNR prior to the construction 28 of a digester structure. The requirements for a permit 29 are based on permit requirements for the construction of 30 manure storage structures. The application must include an 31 engineering report, construction plans, and specifications 32 prepared by a professional engineer. The bill provides 33 for an application fee not to exceed $1,000. The bill also 34 provides for construction design standards for a formed 35 -34- LSB 2958YC (6) 91 da/ns 34/ 36 H.F. _____ or unformed digester structure. The construction design 1 standards must be based on uniform standards such as available 2 standards promulgated by ASTM (American society for testing and 3 materials) international. The design standards for unformed 4 digester feedstock storage structures must account for the use 5 of linings and erosion controls. 6 SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS ââ AIR QUALITY. The bill 7 provides separation distance requirements as part of air 8 quality and water quality standards. Generally, the separation 9 distance requirements for air quality apply between a digester 10 structure and either a residence not owned by the owner of 11 the system or a designated object or location (commercial 12 enterprise, bona fide religious institution, educational 13 institution, public use area, or public thoroughfare). Other 14 separation distances apply to the stockpiling of dry digester 15 manure or feedstock, or digestate and those same designated 16 objects or locations. The bill also provides separation 17 distance requirements for air quality that apply between 18 the digestate application site and the designated object or 19 location. The separation distance requirements for air quality 20 also provide for certain exceptions, including a waiver by a 21 person benefiting from the separation distance. 22 SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS ââ WATER QUALITY. The 23 bill provides a number of separation distance requirements 24 between a digester structure and certain sources of water, 25 including an agricultural drainage well, known sinkhole, lake, 26 river, reservoir, creek, stream, or ditch. The bill provides 27 separation distance requirements between digestate stockpiles 28 and water sources, with exceptions that apply if measures are 29 taken to reduce runoff. Special restrictions are placed on a 30 stockpile located in karst terrain. The bill restricts the 31 application of dry digestate on snow covered or frozen ground. 32 DIGESTATE MANAGEMENT. The bill provides that if digestate 33 is applied on land subject to a manure management plan or 34 nutrient management plan, such plan must be attached with 35 -35- LSB 2958YC (6) 91 da/ns 35/ 36 H.F. _____ a second document referred to as a digestate management 1 supplement. The digestate management supplement must include 2 information necessary to determine the land area required 3 for the application of the digestate and the nutrient 4 concentrations of the digestate. Finally, it requires the 5 owner or manager of the system to maintain records regarding 6 the systemâs operation. 7 CIVIL PENALTIES. A person who violates an air quality 8 regulation or water quality regulation is subject to a civil 9 penalty based on a schedule established by DNR rule. The 10 civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000 per violation. The civil 11 penalty for a water quality violation may also be subject to 12 a judicial civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each day of 13 such violation. 14 -36- LSB 2958YC (6) 91 da/ns 36/ 36
