When property 12 adjacent to a public improvement benefits from the improvement, 13 a special assessment may be levied against the adjacent 14 properties that received the benefit to pay for all or a 15 portion of the improvement.

By changing the 5 definition of âmobile homeâ in Code chapter 555B to include 6 an abandoned mobile home in an unincorporated area, the bill 7 establishes similar procedures for the removal of an abandoned 8 mobile home and personal property as manufactured homes or 9 modular homes in a manufactured home community or mobile home 10 park. 11 The bill also changes the definition of âvalueless homeâ in 12 Code chapter 555C (valueless mobile, modular, and manufactured 13 homes) to include a home on rural property.

The 24 application must include information about the owner, the 25 vehicle, nonowner interests in the vehicle, if applicable, 26 the amount of the fee for new registration, and other 27 information as may reasonably be required by the department of 28 transportation (DOT). In particular, the ownerâs full legal 29 name, social security number or Iowa driverâs license number or 30 Iowa nonoperatorâs identification card number, date of birth, 31 bona fide residence, and mailing address are required. 32 In addition, if the vehicle is owned by a nonresident 33 but still subject to issuance of a certificate of title 34 or registration in Iowa, the application must also contain 35 -8- LSB 2469XS (5) 91 jm/md 8/ 10 S.F. 269 the full legal name, Iowa driverâs license number or Iowa 1 nonoperatorâs identification card number, date of birth, bona 2 fide residence, and mailing address of the primary user of the 3 vehicle. 4 The bill provides for alternative application information 5 required for certain nonresidents. Nonresidents who own 6 residential real property or land suitable for use in 7 farming in Iowa that are registering a vehicle that is used 8 primarily at that property may instead apply using the ownerâs 9 driverâs license number or nonoperatorâs identification card 10 number issued by another state in lieu of both the primary 11 userâs information and the Iowaâs driverâs license number or 12 nonoperatorâs identification card number required under current 13 law. A nonresident who applies for registration and issuance 14 of a certificate of title under the bill is required to provide 15 reasonable proof that the nonresident owns such property in 16 Iowa. The DOT must adopt rules regarding acceptable proof of 17 property ownership, including but not limited to a copy of a 18 deed or utility payment receipts. For purposes of the bill, 19 âresidential real propertyâ means real property, which is an 20 owner-occupied single-family or two-family dwelling, located in 21 this state, occupied or used or intended to be occupied or used 22 for residential purposes, including an interest in any real 23 property covered under Code chapter 499B (horizontal property 24 (condominiums)). 25 In accordance with current law, a nonresident is required to 26 apply for registration and issuance of certificate of title for 27 a vehicle subject to registration to the county treasurer of 28 the county where the primary user of the vehicle is located. 29 DIVISION V ââ SPLIT AND CONSOLIDATION OF PARCELS ââ 30 TAX SALES. The bill provides that a county assessor or 31 county auditor, as applicable, shall not approve a split or 32 consolidation, as each is defined in the bill, for which a plat 33 of survey or acquisition plat is not required, unless each 34 parcel involved in the split or consolidation is not within 35 -9- LSB 2469XS (5) 91 jm/md 9/ 10 S.F. 269 the redemption period under Code chapter 447 or the period 1 specified in Code section 448.12 following a tax sale and is 2 free from unpaid property taxes, special assessments, and 3 drainage assessments for which a waiver or abatement has not 4 been approved. 5 DIVISION VI ââ AUTHORITY TO POSTPONE OR CANCEL TAX SALES. 6 Code section 446.7 provides that annually, on the third Monday 7 in June, the county treasurer shall offer at public sale all 8 parcels on which taxes are delinquent. However, if for good 9 cause the treasurer cannot hold the annual tax sale on that 10 date, the treasurer may designate a different date in June for 11 the sale. 12 The bill modifies the ability of the county treasurer 13 to reschedule the tax sale for good cause by allowing the 14 rescheduled date to be a date not later than 120 days after the 15 third Monday in June. After designation of a different date, 16 the county treasurer may, for good cause and following approval 17 of the board of supervisors, redesignate the date of the tax 18 sale to a date not more than 120 days after the immediately 19 preceding designation, but not later than the date for the 20 subsequent yearâs annual tax sale. 21 -10- LSB 2469XS (5) 91 jm/md 10/ 10

When property 12 adjacent to a public improvement benefits from the improvement, 13 a special assessment may be levied against the adjacent 14 properties that received the benefit to pay for all or a 15 portion of the improvement. Under current law, principal and 16 interest due and delinquent because of a special assessment 17 cannot be collected on a building or improvement erected or 18 made by a person on land owned by another person pursuant to 19 Code sections 445.3 and 445.4.

The bill changes the definition of 2 âmobile homeâ in Code chapter 555B (disposal of abandoned 3 mobile homes and personal property) to include an abandoned 4 mobile home in an unincorporated area. By changing the 5 definition of âmobile homeâ in Code chapter 555B to include 6 an abandoned mobile home in an unincorporated area, the bill 7 establishes similar procedures for the removal of an abandoned 8 mobile home and personal property as manufactured homes or 9 modular homes in a manufactured home community or mobile home 10 park. 11 The bill also changes the definition of âvalueless homeâ in 12 Code chapter 555C (valueless mobile, modular, and manufactured 13 homes) to include a home on rural property. By changing 14 the definition of âvalueless homeâ in Code chapter 555C to 15 include a home on rural property, the bill establishes similar 16 procedures for the removal of a valueless home and personal 17 property from a manufactured home community or mobile home 18 park. Code chapter 555C also establishes procedures to issue a 19 new title to a valueless home to a third party. 20 DIVISION IV ââ NONRESIDENTS VEHICLE REGISTRATION AND 21 CERTIFICATES OF TITLE. Current law requires an owner of a 22 vehicle to apply for registration and issuance of a certificate 23 of title if the vehicle is required to be registered. The 24 application must include information about the owner, the 25 vehicle, nonowner interests in the vehicle, if applicable, 26 the amount of the fee for new registration, and other 27 information as may reasonably be required by the department of 28 transportation (DOT). In particular, the ownerâs full legal 29 name, social security number or Iowa driverâs license number or 30 Iowa nonoperatorâs identification card number, date of birth, 31 bona fide residence, and mailing address are required. 32 In addition, if the vehicle is owned by a nonresident 33 but still subject to issuance of a certificate of title 34 or registration in Iowa, the application must also contain 35 -8- LSB 2469XS (5) 91 jm/md 8/ 10 S.F. 269 the full legal name, Iowa driverâs license number or Iowa 1 nonoperatorâs identification card number, date of birth, bona 2 fide residence, and mailing address of the primary user of the 3 vehicle. 4 The bill provides for alternative application information 5 required for certain nonresidents. Nonresidents who own 6 residential real property or land suitable for use in 7 farming in Iowa that are registering a vehicle that is used 8 primarily at that property may instead apply using the ownerâs 9 driverâs license number or nonoperatorâs identification card 10 number issued by another state in lieu of both the primary 11 userâs information and the Iowaâs driverâs license number or 12 nonoperatorâs identification card number required under current 13 law. A nonresident who applies for registration and issuance 14 of a certificate of title under the bill is required to provide 15 reasonable proof that the nonresident owns such property in 16 Iowa.

The bill provides that a county assessor or 31 county auditor, as applicable, shall not approve a split or 32 consolidation, as each is defined in the bill, for which a plat 33 of survey or acquisition plat is not required, unless each 34 parcel involved in the split or consolidation is not within 35 -9- LSB 2469XS (5) 91 jm/md 9/ 10 S.F. 269 the redemption period under Code chapter 447 or the period 1 specified in Code section 448.12 following a tax sale and is 2 free from unpaid property taxes, special assessments, and 3 drainage assessments for which a waiver or abatement has not 4 been approved. 5 DIVISION VI ââ AUTHORITY TO POSTPONE OR CANCEL TAX SALES. 6 Code section 446.7 provides that annually, on the third Monday 7 in June, the county treasurer shall offer at public sale all 8 parcels on which taxes are delinquent. However, if for good 9 cause the treasurer cannot hold the annual tax sale on that 10 date, the treasurer may designate a different date in June for 11 the sale. 12 The bill modifies the ability of the county treasurer 13 to reschedule the tax sale for good cause by allowing the 14 rescheduled date to be a date not later than 120 days after the 15 third Monday in June. After designation of a different date, 16 the county treasurer may, for good cause and following approval 17 of the board of supervisors, redesignate the date of the tax 18 sale to a date not more than 120 days after the immediately 19 preceding designation, but not later than the date for the 20 subsequent yearâs annual tax sale. 21 -10- LSB 2469XS (5) 91 jm/md 10/ 10
