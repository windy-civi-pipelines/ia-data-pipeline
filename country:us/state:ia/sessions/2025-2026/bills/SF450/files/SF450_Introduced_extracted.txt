This provision is effective 5 upon enactment. Additionally, the bill requires the director 6 of DE to provide teachers who are employed by schools most in 7 need of support with evidence-based professional development 8 services related to implementing high-quality mathematics 9 instruction. The bill requires the director of DE to develop 10 and publish on DEâs internet site a list of valid and reliable 11 mathematics screeners that may be used by teachers to identify 12 students enrolled in kindergarten through grade six who may 13 require additional instruction or support in mathematics. 14 The bill requires school districts to assess all students 15 enrolled in kindergarten through grade six at least three 16 times each school year to determine the studentsâ level of 17 mathematics proficiency by administering a mathematics screener 18 that is on the list on DEâs internet site. If, as the result of 19 the assessments, a school district determines that a student 20 is persistently at risk in mathematics, the school district is 21 required to take certain specified steps involving additional 22 assessments, the development of personalized mathematics plans, 23 and interventions. The school district is required to take 24 these steps until the student performs at benchmark on the 25 statewide summative assessment in mathematics or until the 26 student performs at benchmark on an assessment, whichever 27 occurs first. The bill defines âpersistently at riskâ to mean 28 that the student has not met the grade-level benchmark on two 29 consecutive assessments. The bill requires the state board of 30 education to adopt rules to administer these provisions. 31 The bill provides that the state board of education is 32 required to adopt rules requiring all higher education 33 institutions providing practitioner preparation to include 34 preparation in methods for teaching mathematics. The 35 -4- LSB 1874SV (2) 91 jda/jh 4/ 5 S.F. 450 bill authorizes a higher education institution providing 1 practitioner preparation to satisfy this requirement by 2 requiring students who will be teaching mathematics to 3 students enrolled in kindergarten through grade 12 to complete 4 mathematics methods coursework and demonstrate competency in 5 certain specified areas. 6 The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code 7 section 25B.3. The bill requires that the state cost of 8 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school 9 district from state school foundation aid received by the 10 school district under Code section 257.16. The specification 11 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate 12 funding-related requirements of Code section 25B.2. The 13 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the 14 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state 15 mandates included in the bill. 16 -5- LSB 1874SV (2) 91 jda/jh 5/ 5
