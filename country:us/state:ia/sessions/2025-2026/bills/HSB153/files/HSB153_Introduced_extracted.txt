Under current law, a 20 psychiatric medical institution for children (PMIC) is an 21 institution providing more than 24 hours of continuous care 22 involving long-term psychiatric services to 3 or more children 23 in residence for expected periods of 14 days or more for 24 diagnosis and evaluation, or for expected periods of 90 days 25 or more for treatment. 26 The bill exempts PMICs from licensing requirements for 27 maintaining or conducting programs with the primary purpose 28 of treating and rehabilitating persons with a substance use 29 disorder. 30 The bill defines âapproved qualifying organizationâ as 31 the joint commission, the commission on the accreditation of 32 rehabilitation facilities, the council on accreditation, a 33 nationally recognized accrediting organization that operates 34 in conformance with federal regulations and has accreditation 35 -33- LSB 1457XD (16) 91 dg/ko 33/ 38 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ standards comparable to the previously mentioned entities, or 1 an entity specified by the department of inspections, appeals, 2 and licensing (DIAL) by rule created in consultation with the 3 department of health and human services (HHS). 4 The bill defines âmental health disorderâ as a mental 5 disorder as defined in the most recent version of the 6 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published 7 by the American psychiatric association, or a mental disorder 8 as defined in the most recent version of the international 9 classification of diseases published by the world health 10 organization. 11 The bill defines âprotective locked environmentâ as a 12 setting that prevents egress from a building or grounds as a 13 protective measure to ensure safety and security. 14 The bill defines ârecord check evaluation systemâ as the 15 record check evaluation system of HHS used to perform child and 16 dependent adult abuse record checks and to evaluate criminal 17 history and abuse records. 18 The bill defines âserious emotional disturbance disorderâ 19 as a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder 20 of sufficient duration to result in a functional impairment 21 and that meets the diagnostic criteria in the most current 22 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published 23 by the American psychiatric association. âSerious emotional 24 disturbance disorderâ does not include a substance use or 25 developmental disorder unless such disorder co-occurs with a 26 diagnosable disorder that would otherwise constitute a serious 27 emotional disturbance disorder. 28 The bill defines âsubstance use disorderâ as a diagnosable 29 substance use disorder of sufficient duration to meet 30 diagnostic criteria specified within the most current 31 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published 32 by the American psychiatric association that results in a 33 functional impairment. 34 The bill defines âyouthâ as a person who is less than 21 35 -34- LSB 1457XD (16) 91 dg/ko 34/ 38 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ years of age. 1 The bill describes the nature of care a PMIC must offer youth 2 with a serious emotional disturbance disorder (SEDD), substance 3 use disorder (SUD), or both. 4 Under current law, a person who establishes a PMIC must 5 also hold a license under Code chapter 237 (child foster 6 care facilities) as a comprehensive residential facility for 7 children, or hold a license under Code chapter 125 (substance 8 use disorders) if the facility provides SUD treatment. The 9 bill eliminates the requirement that a PMIC holds either 10 of these additional licenses, and instead requires that an 11 applicant for a PMIC license specify whether the applicant will 12 provide SEDD services, SUD services, or both. A PMIC may only 13 provide services for which it is licensed. 14 The bill eliminates the requirement that a proposed PMIC be 15 under the direction of an agency which has previously operated 16 a facility for children or adolescents and meets or exceeds 17 requirements for licensure as a comprehensive residential 18 facility for children. 19 The bill requires DIAL, in cooperation with HHS, to adopt 20 rules to allow a PMIC to use a protective locked environment 21 at the PMIC. 22 Under current law, following the hospitalization hearing 23 on an involuntary commitment petition, if the court finds 24 by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent has a 25 serious mental impairment, the court shall order the respondent 26 committed for a complete psychiatric evaluation and appropriate 27 treatment. The chief medical officer (CMO) of the hospital or 28 facility at which a respondent is committed must report to the 29 court no more than 15 days after the date the respondent is 30 placed, making a recommendation for disposition of the matter. 31 The bill allows a court to place a minor respondent in a public 32 hospital and allows a CMO of the hospital no more than 30 33 days after the date the minor respondent is placed to make a 34 recommendation for disposition of the matter. 35 -35- LSB 1457XD (16) 91 dg/ko 35/ 38 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ The bill defines âbehavioral health evaluationâ as a 1 comprehensive evaluation of a personâs mental and behavioral 2 health by a person licensed under Code chapter 154B 3 (psychology), 154C (social work), or 154D (behavioral science) 4 for purposes including but not limited to identifying a 5 possible behavioral health condition. 6 The bill defines âphysical assessmentâ as direct physical 7 touching, viewing, and medically necessary manipulation of any 8 area of a childâs body by a licensed physician. 9 The bill also defines âbehavioral health conditionâ for 10 purposes of Code chapter 232 (juvenile justice). 11 The bill replaces several references to a physical or mental 12 examination with references to a physical assessment (PA) or 13 behavioral health evaluation (BHE) and replaces references to a 14 personâs abuse of alcohol or other controlled substances with 15 references to the person having a behavioral health condition. 16 Under current law, one of several specific circumstances 17 must exist before a juvenile court has the authority to enter 18 an ex parte order to direct a peace officer or a juvenile court 19 officer to take custody of a child before or after the filing 20 of a petition under Code chapter 232 (juvenile justice). The 21 bill adds the circumstance when the childâs parent, guardian, 22 or legal custodian consents to the removal as a condition that 23 would permit a juvenile court to enter such an ex parte order. 24 The bill creates similar provisions for when a juvenile court 25 may enter an ex parte order for a child to undergo an inpatient 26 PA or an inpatient BHE and when a person authorized to conduct 27 a preliminary investigation in response to a complaint 28 may motion to ask the court to order a child to undergo an 29 inpatient PA or an inpatient BHE. 30 The bill authorizes a court, after a dispositional hearing, 31 to order a child in a child in need of assistance (CINA) 32 proceeding or a family in need of assistance (FINA) proceeding 33 to receive an inpatient PA, an inpatient BHE, or both, at the 34 state training school (STS) if HHS requests such an order. 35 -36- LSB 1457XD (16) 91 dg/ko 36/ 38 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ A child ordered to the STS pursuant to a CINA proceeding 1 or a FINA proceeding must be separated at all times from 2 children placed in the STS pursuant to a juvenile delinquency 3 proceeding. Under current law, the court in a CINA or FINA 4 proceeding is prohibited from placing a child in the STS for 5 any reason. 6 The bill exempts a PMIC from licensing requirements for 7 child foster care. 8 The bill directs HHS and DIAL to adopt rules pertaining to 9 the use of seclusion and restraints at certain facilities as 10 detailed in the bill. 11 The bill makes conforming changes to Code chapters 135H 12 (psychiatric medical institutions for children) and 232 13 (juvenile justice). The bill repeals 2024 Iowa Acts, chapter 14 1161, sections 97 and 98. 15 DIVISION II ââ EXEMPTION FROM CHILDRENâS RESIDENTIAL 16 FACILITY CERTIFICATION. The bill provides an exception from 17 the definition of âchildrenâs residential facilityâ under Code 18 chapter 237C, for care furnished by a live-in facility that 19 provides intensive medical care and support for individuals 20 who require ongoing treatment if the facility only furnishes 21 care to persons 16 years of age and older and HHS is paying for 22 each personâs care from the facility under a federally approved 23 home and community-based services waiver or under another 24 provision of the medical assistance program. By operation of 25 law, the excepted live-in facilities are exempt from childrenâs 26 residential facility requirements, including certification. 27 DIVISION III ââ DIRECTOR OF JUVENILE COURT SERVICES ââ 28 CHIEF JUVENILE COURT OFFICERS. Under current law, the chief 29 juvenile court officers are appointed, terminated for cause, 30 and otherwise act under the direction and supervision of the 31 chief judge for the judicial district in which the chief 32 juvenile court officer was appointed. The bill transfers the 33 chief judgesâ authority over chief juvenile court officers to 34 the director of juvenile court services. 35 -37- LSB 1457XD (16) 91 dg/ko 37/ 38 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ DIVISION IV ââ HAWKI ELIGIBILITY ââ PUBLIC INSTITUTION 1 INMATES. The bill defines âpublic institutionâ to mean the 2 same as defined in 42 C.F.R. Â§435.1010. 3 Current law does not permit a child who is an inmate in a 4 public institution to be eligible for the Hawki program. The 5 bill requires HHS to suspend, but not terminate, Hawki program 6 eligibility for a child in a public institution if the child 7 is otherwise eligible for the Hawki program except for the 8 childâs status as an inmate, the child was enrolled in the 9 Hawki program at the time the child was committed to the public 10 institution, and 30 calendar days have elapsed since the date 11 the child was committed to the public institution. A childâs 12 suspension of Hawki benefits must continue for the duration of 13 the childâs commitment to a public institution. 14 The bill requires the public institution to which a child 15 is committed and HHS to provide monthly reports and expedite 16 the restoration of the childâs Hawki benefits upon the childâs 17 discharge from the public institution. The bill requires HHS 18 to adopt rules to administer the billâs provisions related to 19 Hawki benefits for children committed to a public institution. 20 DIVISION V ââ CORRECTIVE CHANGES. The bill updates 21 references to certain accrediting organizations through the 22 Code, corrects a reference throughout the Code related to 23 the citation for the definition of âreasonable effortsâ, 24 and changes the term âlegal custodianâ to the defined term 25 âcustodianâ. 26 -38- LSB 1457XD (16) 91 dg/ko 38/ 38

A PMIC may only 13 provide services for which it is licensed. 14 The bill eliminates the requirement that a proposed PMIC be 15 under the direction of an agency which has previously operated 16 a facility for children or adolescents and meets or exceeds 17 requirements for licensure as a comprehensive residential 18 facility for children. 19 The bill requires DIAL, in cooperation with HHS, to adopt 20 rules to allow a PMIC to use a protective locked environment 21 at the PMIC. 22 Under current law, following the hospitalization hearing 23 on an involuntary commitment petition, if the court finds 24 by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent has a 25 serious mental impairment, the court shall order the respondent 26 committed for a complete psychiatric evaluation and appropriate 27 treatment. The chief medical officer (CMO) of the hospital or 28 facility at which a respondent is committed must report to the 29 court no more than 15 days after the date the respondent is 30 placed, making a recommendation for disposition of the matter. 31 The bill allows a court to place a minor respondent in a public 32 hospital and allows a CMO of the hospital no more than 30 33 days after the date the minor respondent is placed to make a 34 recommendation for disposition of the matter. 35 -35- LSB 1457XD (16) 91 dg/ko 35/ 38 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ The bill defines âbehavioral health evaluationâ as a 1 comprehensive evaluation of a personâs mental and behavioral 2 health by a person licensed under Code chapter 154B 3 (psychology), 154C (social work), or 154D (behavioral science) 4 for purposes including but not limited to identifying a 5 possible behavioral health condition. 6 The bill defines âphysical assessmentâ as direct physical 7 touching, viewing, and medically necessary manipulation of any 8 area of a childâs body by a licensed physician. 9 The bill also defines âbehavioral health conditionâ for 10 purposes of Code chapter 232 (juvenile justice). 11 The bill replaces several references to a physical or mental 12 examination with references to a physical assessment (PA) or 13 behavioral health evaluation (BHE) and replaces references to a 14 personâs abuse of alcohol or other controlled substances with 15 references to the person having a behavioral health condition. 16 Under current law, one of several specific circumstances 17 must exist before a juvenile court has the authority to enter 18 an ex parte order to direct a peace officer or a juvenile court 19 officer to take custody of a child before or after the filing 20 of a petition under Code chapter 232 (juvenile justice). The 21 bill adds the circumstance when the childâs parent, guardian, 22 or legal custodian consents to the removal as a condition that 23 would permit a juvenile court to enter such an ex parte order. 24 The bill creates similar provisions for when a juvenile court 25 may enter an ex parte order for a child to undergo an inpatient 26 PA or an inpatient BHE and when a person authorized to conduct 27 a preliminary investigation in response to a complaint 28 may motion to ask the court to order a child to undergo an 29 inpatient PA or an inpatient BHE. 30 The bill authorizes a court, after a dispositional hearing, 31 to order a child in a child in need of assistance (CINA) 32 proceeding or a family in need of assistance (FINA) proceeding 33 to receive an inpatient PA, an inpatient BHE, or both, at the 34 state training school (STS) if HHS requests such an order. 35 -36- LSB 1457XD (16) 91 dg/ko 36/ 38 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ A child ordered to the STS pursuant to a CINA proceeding 1 or a FINA proceeding must be separated at all times from 2 children placed in the STS pursuant to a juvenile delinquency 3 proceeding. Under current law, the court in a CINA or FINA 4 proceeding is prohibited from placing a child in the STS for 5 any reason. 6 The bill exempts a PMIC from licensing requirements for 7 child foster care. 8 The bill directs HHS and DIAL to adopt rules pertaining to 9 the use of seclusion and restraints at certain facilities as 10 detailed in the bill. 11 The bill makes conforming changes to Code chapters 135H 12 (psychiatric medical institutions for children) and 232 13 (juvenile justice). The bill repeals 2024 Iowa Acts, chapter 14 1161, sections 97 and 98. 15 DIVISION II ââ EXEMPTION FROM CHILDRENâS RESIDENTIAL 16 FACILITY CERTIFICATION. The bill provides an exception from 17 the definition of âchildrenâs residential facilityâ under Code 18 chapter 237C, for care furnished by a live-in facility that 19 provides intensive medical care and support for individuals 20 who require ongoing treatment if the facility only furnishes 21 care to persons 16 years of age and older and HHS is paying for 22 each personâs care from the facility under a federally approved 23 home and community-based services waiver or under another 24 provision of the medical assistance program. By operation of 25 law, the excepted live-in facilities are exempt from childrenâs 26 residential facility requirements, including certification. 27 DIVISION III ââ DIRECTOR OF JUVENILE COURT SERVICES ââ 28 CHIEF JUVENILE COURT OFFICERS. Under current law, the chief 29 juvenile court officers are appointed, terminated for cause, 30 and otherwise act under the direction and supervision of the 31 chief judge for the judicial district in which the chief 32 juvenile court officer was appointed. The bill transfers the 33 chief judgesâ authority over chief juvenile court officers to 34 the director of juvenile court services. 35 -37- LSB 1457XD (16) 91 dg/ko 37/ 38 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ DIVISION IV ââ HAWKI ELIGIBILITY ââ PUBLIC INSTITUTION 1 INMATES. The bill defines âpublic institutionâ to mean the 2 same as defined in 42 C.F.R. Â§435.1010. 3 Current law does not permit a child who is an inmate in a 4 public institution to be eligible for the Hawki program. The 5 bill requires HHS to suspend, but not terminate, Hawki program 6 eligibility for a child in a public institution if the child 7 is otherwise eligible for the Hawki program except for the 8 childâs status as an inmate, the child was enrolled in the 9 Hawki program at the time the child was committed to the public 10 institution, and 30 calendar days have elapsed since the date 11 the child was committed to the public institution. A childâs 12 suspension of Hawki benefits must continue for the duration of 13 the childâs commitment to a public institution. 14 The bill requires the public institution to which a child 15 is committed and HHS to provide monthly reports and expedite 16 the restoration of the childâs Hawki benefits upon the childâs 17 discharge from the public institution. The bill requires HHS 18 to adopt rules to administer the billâs provisions related to 19 Hawki benefits for children committed to a public institution. 20 DIVISION V ââ CORRECTIVE CHANGES. The bill updates 21 references to certain accrediting organizations through the 22 Code, corrects a reference throughout the Code related to 23 the citation for the definition of âreasonable effortsâ, 24 and changes the term âlegal custodianâ to the defined term 25 âcustodianâ. 26 -38- LSB 1457XD (16) 91 dg/ko 38/ 38
