The 13 bill excludes persons employed by an administrative services 14 organization (ASO) from the definition of an employee for the 15 purposes of the Iowa public employeesâ retirement system. 16 The bill defines âbehavioral health districtâ and 17 âdisability access pointâ. 18 The bill prohibits an ASO, an officer or an employee of an 19 ASO, or an officer or an employee of a disability access point 20 from acting as a countyâs advocate to represent the interests 21 of patients involuntarily hospitalized by the court in matters 22 relating to a patientâs hospitalization or treatment. 23 DIVISION II ââ CHILD FOSTER CARE. Under current law, a 24 personâs periodic support payments pursuant to an order or 25 judgment are deemed assigned to HHS if the person is or has a 26 child receiving foster care services. The assignment does not 27 apply when a child is placed with a relative or fictive kin of 28 the child who is not licensed to provide child foster care. 29 The bill permits the assignment unless the relative or fictive 30 kin is not licensed to provide child foster care and is not an 31 approved kinship caregiver. 32 The bill defines âapprovalâ as the authorization granted 33 to a kinship caregiver by HHS through an expedited process 34 under Code chapter 237 to receive maximum financial support 35 -30- LSB 1459HW (2) 91 dg/ko 30/ 34 H.F. 1042 and to obtain the information and resources necessary to meet 1 the needs of a child under a court-ordered placement with the 2 kinship caregiver. 3 The bill defines âfictive kinâ as an adult person who is 4 not a relative of a child but who has an emotionally positive 5 significant relationship with the child or the childâs family. 6 The bill defines âfoster family homeâ as a licensed 7 single-family home environment in which child foster care is 8 provided. 9 The bill defines âindividualâ as a natural person or a 10 married couple. 11 The bill defines âkinship caregiverâ as a relative or 12 fictive kin of a child. 13 The bill defines âlicenseâ as the authorization issued to an 14 individual or an agency by HHS to provide child foster care. 15 The bill defines ârelativeâ as an individual related to a 16 child within the fourth degree of consanguinity or affinity by 17 marriage or through adoption. 18 The bill also defines âagency licenseeâ, âapproved kinship 19 caregiverâ, and âindividual licenseeâ. 20 The bill makes several changes to Code chapter 237 and to 21 Code sections 232.78 (temporary custody of a child pursuant to 22 ex parte court order), 232.98 (hearing concerning temporary 23 removal), 232.102 (transfer of legal custody of child and 24 placement), 234.1 (child and family services ââ definitions), 25 234.39 (child and family services ââ responsibility for costs 26 of services), 237A.1 (child care facilities ââ definitions), 27 237A.3A (child development homes), and 423.3 (streamlined sales 28 and use tax Act ââ exemptions). 29 DIVISION III ââ CHILD AND DEPENDENT ADULT ABUSE. The bill 30 requires HHS to adopt rules to administer the child protection 31 center grant program. 32 The bill allows a community-based entity to apply for and 33 receive funds appropriated to HHS by the general assembly 34 for child abuse prevention. Under current law, only a 35 -31- LSB 1459HW (2) 91 dg/ko 31/ 34 H.F. 1042 community-based volunteer coalition or council can apply for 1 and receive such funds. 2 The bill makes child abuse information, and information 3 obtained in the course of an assessment or evaluation of a 4 report of dependent adult abuse, confidential records. 5 The bill defines âexploitation of a dependent adultâ as 6 a fraudulent or otherwise illegal, unauthorized, or improper 7 attempt, act, or process by a caretaker or fiduciary to use the 8 physical or financial resources of a dependent adult for the 9 purpose of monetary or personal benefit, profit, or gain, or to 10 deprive the dependent adult of the use of the dependent adultâs 11 physical or financial resources, including any benefits, 12 belongings, or assets. 13 Under current law, upon a showing of probable cause that 14 a dependent adult has been financially exploited a court may 15 authorize a person, who is also authorized by HHS, to gain 16 access to the financial records of the dependent adult. The 17 bill amends the statute so the person authorized by the court 18 and HHS can gain access to financial records that HHS has a 19 reasonable belief are related to the financial resources of the 20 dependent adult. 21 The bill authorizes an instrumentality of the state to 22 access dependent adult abuse records. 23 The bill requires the director of HHS to require providers 24 under the medical assistance program to share information with 25 HHS as necessary to identify, prevent, or respond to child or 26 dependent adult abuse. 27 DIVISION IV ââ DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 28 ââ INTERNAL AUDITS AND EXAMINATIONS. The bill requires an 29 internal audit or examination conducted by or on behalf of 30 HHS to be conducted in accordance with the most recent global 31 internal audit standards published by the institute of internal 32 auditors. 33 The bill requires information created or received by 34 HHS in the course of an internal audit or examination 35 -32- LSB 1459HW (2) 91 dg/ko 32/ 34 H.F. 1042 conducted by or on behalf of HHS, including allegations 1 of misconduct or noncompliance, and all internal audit or 2 examination workpapers, to be treated as confidential. Such 3 confidentiality shall not be construed to limit the auditor 4 of stateâs (auditor) access to information the auditor is 5 authorized to access by Code section 11.41. Information shared 6 with the auditor may not be disclosed by the auditor unless the 7 director of HHS authorizes the disclosure in writing or the 8 information is contained in HHSâs final report for the internal 9 audit or examination. 10 DIVISION V ââ REGION INCENTIVE FUND ââ DISTRIBUTIONS AND 11 TRANSFERS. The bill appropriates from the region incentive 12 fund of the mental health and disability services regional 13 service fund to HHS for FY 2024-2025, an amount as necessary to 14 ensure the continuity of care for persons transferring services 15 from the mental health and disability services system to the 16 behavioral health services system (BHSS) and for distribution 17 to ASOs to be used for expenses related to the duties of the ASO 18 under the BHSS. The moneys used by an ASO do not count toward 19 any limit on the ASOâs administrative costs. 20 The bill requires any unobligated and unencumbered moneys 21 remaining in the mental health and disability services regional 22 service fund on June 30, 2025, to be transferred to the 23 behavioral health fund. 24 This division of the bill is effective upon enactment and 25 applies retroactively to July 1, 2024. 26 DIVISION VI ââ HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION ââ APPLICABLE 27 PERCENTAGE FOR PREMIUM TAX. Under current law, a health 28 maintenance organization contracting with HHS to administer the 29 medical assistance program must pay taxes to the director of 30 the department of revenue for deposit in the Medicaid managed 31 care organization premiums fund, an amount equal to 2.5 percent 32 of the premiums received and taxable. The bill changes such 33 amount to the applicable percent of the premiums received and 34 taxable. The âapplicable percentâ is defined in Code section 35 -33- LSB 1459HW (2) 91 dg/ko 33/ 34 H.F. 1042 432.1(2) (tax on gross premiums ââ exclusions), and is .95 1 percent for the 2025 calendar year, .925 percent for the 2026 2 calendar year, and .9 percent for the 2027 calendar year and 3 all subsequent calendar years. 4 This division of the bill is effective upon enactment and 5 applies retroactively to January 1, 2024. 6 -34- LSB 1459HW (2) 91 dg/ko 34/ 34

The 13 bill excludes persons employed by an administrative services 14 organization (ASO) from the definition of an employee for the 15 purposes of the Iowa public employeesâ retirement system. 16 The bill defines âbehavioral health districtâ and 17 âdisability access pointâ. 18 The bill prohibits an ASO, an officer or an employee of an 19 ASO, or an officer or an employee of a disability access point 20 from acting as a countyâs advocate to represent the interests 21 of patients involuntarily hospitalized by the court in matters 22 relating to a patientâs hospitalization or treatment. 23 DIVISION II ââ CHILD FOSTER CARE. Under current law, a 24 personâs periodic support payments pursuant to an order or 25 judgment are deemed assigned to HHS if the person is or has a 26 child receiving foster care services. The assignment does not 27 apply when a child is placed with a relative or fictive kin of 28 the child who is not licensed to provide child foster care. 29 The bill permits the assignment unless the relative or fictive 30 kin is not licensed to provide child foster care and is not an 31 approved kinship caregiver. 32 The bill defines âapprovalâ as the authorization granted 33 to a kinship caregiver by HHS through an expedited process 34 under Code chapter 237 to receive maximum financial support 35 -30- LSB 1459HW (2) 91 dg/ko 30/ 34 H.F. 1042 and to obtain the information and resources necessary to meet 1 the needs of a child under a court-ordered placement with the 2 kinship caregiver. 3 The bill defines âfictive kinâ as an adult person who is 4 not a relative of a child but who has an emotionally positive 5 significant relationship with the child or the childâs family. 6 The bill defines âfoster family homeâ as a licensed 7 single-family home environment in which child foster care is 8 provided. 9 The bill defines âindividualâ as a natural person or a 10 married couple. 11 The bill defines âkinship caregiverâ as a relative or 12 fictive kin of a child. 13 The bill defines âlicenseâ as the authorization issued to an 14 individual or an agency by HHS to provide child foster care. 15 The bill defines ârelativeâ as an individual related to a 16 child within the fourth degree of consanguinity or affinity by 17 marriage or through adoption. 18 The bill also defines âagency licenseeâ, âapproved kinship 19 caregiverâ, and âindividual licenseeâ. 20 The bill makes several changes to Code chapter 237 and to 21 Code sections 232.78 (temporary custody of a child pursuant to 22 ex parte court order), 232.98 (hearing concerning temporary 23 removal), 232.102 (transfer of legal custody of child and 24 placement), 234.1 (child and family services ââ definitions), 25 234.39 (child and family services ââ responsibility for costs 26 of services), 237A.1 (child care facilities ââ definitions), 27 237A.3A (child development homes), and 423.3 (streamlined sales 28 and use tax Act ââ exemptions). 29 DIVISION III ââ CHILD AND DEPENDENT ADULT ABUSE. The bill 30 requires HHS to adopt rules to administer the child protection 31 center grant program. 32 The bill allows a community-based entity to apply for and 33 receive funds appropriated to HHS by the general assembly 34 for child abuse prevention. Under current law, only a 35 -31- LSB 1459HW (2) 91 dg/ko 31/ 34 H.F. 1042 community-based volunteer coalition or council can apply for 1 and receive such funds. 2 The bill makes child abuse information, and information 3 obtained in the course of an assessment or evaluation of a 4 report of dependent adult abuse, confidential records. 5 The bill defines âexploitation of a dependent adultâ as 6 a fraudulent or otherwise illegal, unauthorized, or improper 7 attempt, act, or process by a caretaker or fiduciary to use the 8 physical or financial resources of a dependent adult for the 9 purpose of monetary or personal benefit, profit, or gain, or to 10 deprive the dependent adult of the use of the dependent adultâs 11 physical or financial resources, including any benefits, 12 belongings, or assets. 13 Under current law, upon a showing of probable cause that 14 a dependent adult has been financially exploited a court may 15 authorize a person, who is also authorized by HHS, to gain 16 access to the financial records of the dependent adult. The 17 bill amends the statute so the person authorized by the court 18 and HHS can gain access to financial records that HHS has a 19 reasonable belief are related to the financial resources of the 20 dependent adult. 21 The bill authorizes an instrumentality of the state to 22 access dependent adult abuse records. 23 The bill requires the director of HHS to require providers 24 under the medical assistance program to share information with 25 HHS as necessary to identify, prevent, or respond to child or 26 dependent adult abuse. 27 DIVISION IV ââ DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 28 ââ INTERNAL AUDITS AND EXAMINATIONS. The bill requires an 29 internal audit or examination conducted by or on behalf of 30 HHS to be conducted in accordance with the most recent global 31 internal audit standards published by the institute of internal 32 auditors. 33 The bill requires information created or received by 34 HHS in the course of an internal audit or examination 35 -32- LSB 1459HW (2) 91 dg/ko 32/ 34 H.F. 1042 conducted by or on behalf of HHS, including allegations 1 of misconduct or noncompliance, and all internal audit or 2 examination workpapers, to be treated as confidential. Such 3 confidentiality shall not be construed to limit the auditor 4 of stateâs (auditor) access to information the auditor is 5 authorized to access by Code section 11.41. Information shared 6 with the auditor may not be disclosed by the auditor unless the 7 director of HHS authorizes the disclosure in writing or the 8 information is contained in HHSâs final report for the internal 9 audit or examination. 10 DIVISION V ââ REGION INCENTIVE FUND ââ DISTRIBUTIONS AND 11 TRANSFERS. The bill appropriates from the region incentive 12 fund of the mental health and disability services regional 13 service fund to HHS for FY 2024-2025, an amount as necessary to 14 ensure the continuity of care for persons transferring services 15 from the mental health and disability services system to the 16 behavioral health services system (BHSS) and for distribution 17 to ASOs to be used for expenses related to the duties of the ASO 18 under the BHSS. The moneys used by an ASO do not count toward 19 any limit on the ASOâs administrative costs. 20 The bill requires any unobligated and unencumbered moneys 21 remaining in the mental health and disability services regional 22 service fund on June 30, 2025, to be transferred to the 23 behavioral health fund. 24 This division of the bill is effective upon enactment and 25 applies retroactively to July 1, 2024. 26 DIVISION VI ââ HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION ââ APPLICABLE 27 PERCENTAGE FOR PREMIUM TAX. Under current law, a health 28 maintenance organization contracting with HHS to administer the 29 medical assistance program must pay taxes to the director of 30 the department of revenue for deposit in the Medicaid managed 31 care organization premiums fund, an amount equal to 2.5 percent 32 of the premiums received and taxable. The bill changes such 33 amount to the applicable percent of the premiums received and 34 taxable.
