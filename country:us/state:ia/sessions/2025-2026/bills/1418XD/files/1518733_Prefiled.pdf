S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 with the noncitizen identification information maintained by
2 the department of transportation.
3 The bill requires a voter registration to be marked as
4 “unconfirmed” if a registrant marks on the voter registration
5 form that the registrant is a noncitizen and also signs
6 the portion of the form affirming that the registrant is a
7 citizen of the United States or if the state registrar of
8 voters or county commissioner of elections receives reliable
9 information that the registered voter is not a citizen of the
10 United States. The bill requires a voter registration to be
11 changed from unconfirmed to active if the registered voter
12 provides evidence that the registered voter is qualified to
13 vote. The bill adds a statement regarding citizenship status
14 to the declaration of eligibility signed by each voter prior
15 to receiving a ballot.
16 The bill also requires a voter registration to be canceled
17 if the registered voter submits documentation that indicates
18 that the registered voter is not a citizen of the United States
19 or reports to a state or federal agency that the registered
20 voter is not a citizen of the United States. The bill allows
21 a precinct election official to question a person about the
22 person’s citizenship status if the right of the person to vote
23 is challenged at the time the person is offering to vote.
24 The bill requires the special precinct election board to
25 reject provisional ballots that have not been cured by the
26 statutory deadline.
