The compact creates another pathway for 12 licensure and does not otherwise change a stateâs existing 13 podiatric medical practice act. The compact also adopts the 14 prevailing standard for licensure and affirms that the practice 15 of podiatric medicine occurs where the patient is located 16 at the time of the podiatric physician-patient encounter, 17 and therefore, requires the podiatric physician to be under 18 the jurisdiction of the state podiatric medical board where 19 the patient is located.

The interstate commission shall be entitled to receive 10 all service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have 11 standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. 12 Failure to provide service of process to the interstate 13 commission shall render judgment or order void as to the 14 interstate commission, the compact, or promulgated rules. 15 17.

If disciplinary action is taken against a podiatric 3 physician by a member board not in a state of principal 4 license, any other member board may deem the action conclusive 5 as to matters of law and fact decided and do any of the 6 following: 7 (1) Impose the same or lesser sanction against the podiatric 8 physician so long as such sanctions are consistent with the 9 podiatric medical practice act of that state. 10 (2) Pursue separate disciplinary action against the 11 podiatric physician under its respective podiatric medical 12 practice act, regardless of the action taken in other member 13 states. 14 d. If a license granted to a podiatric physician by a 15 member board is revoked, surrendered or relinquished in 16 lieu of discipline, or suspended, then any license issued 17 to a podiatric physician by any other member board shall be 18 suspended, automatically and immediately without further action 19 necessary by the other member board for ninety days upon 20 entry of the order by the disciplining board, to permit the 21 member board to investigate the basis for the action under the 22 podiatric medical practice act of that state. 23 e. A member board may terminate the automatic suspension 24 under paragraph âbâ or âdâ of a license it issued, in a manner 25 consistent with the podiatric medical practice act of that 26 state. 27 11.

The executive, legislative, and judicial branches 33 of state government in each member state shall enforce the 34 compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to 35 -17- LSB 2380HV (1) 91 ss/ko 17/ 23 H.F. 930 effectuate the compactâs purposes and intent. The provisions 1 of the compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall have 2 standing as statutory law but shall not override existing state 3 authority to regulate the practice of podiatric medicine. 4 b.

The interstate commission shall be entitled to receive 10 all service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have 11 standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. 12 Failure to provide service of process to the interstate 13 commission shall render judgment or order void as to the 14 interstate commission, the compact, or promulgated rules. 15 17. Enforcement of interstate compact. 16 a. The interstate commission, in the reasonable exercise of 17 its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of the 18 compact. 19 b.

The relief sought may include 27 both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial 28 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded 29 all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney 30 fees. 31 c. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies 32 of the interstate commission.

If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, 19 the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact 20 upon an affirmative vote of the majority of the commissioners 21 present and voting, and all rights, privileges, and benefits 22 conferred by the compact shall terminate on the effective date 23 of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the 24 offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during 25 the period of default. 26 d. Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed 27 only after all other means of securing compliance have been 28 exhausted. Notice of intent to terminate shall be given by 29 the interstate commission to the governor, the majority and 30 minority leaders of the defaulting stateâs legislature, and 31 each of the member states. 32 e.

The interstate commission shall not bear any costs 7 relating to any state that has been found to be in default or 8 which has been terminated from the compact, unless otherwise 9 mutually agreed upon in writing between the interstate 10 commission and the defaulting state. 11 h. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the 12 interstate commission by petitioning the United States district 13 court for the District of Columbia or the federal district 14 court where the interstate commission has its principal office. 15 The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of litigation 16 including reasonable attorney fees. 17 19.

Withdrawal. 6 a. Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and 7 remain binding upon each and every member state; provided that 8 a member state may withdraw from the compact by specifically 9 repealing the statute which enacted the compact into law. 10 b. Withdrawal from the compact shall be by the enactment 11 of a statute repealing the same, but shall not take effect 12 until one year after the effective date of such statute and 13 until written notice of the withdrawal has been given by the 14 withdrawing state to the governor of each member state. 15 c. The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the 16 chairperson of the interstate commission in writing upon the 17 introduction of legislation repealing the compact in the 18 withdrawing state. 19 d. The interstate commission shall notify the other member 20 states of the withdrawing stateâs intent to withdraw within 21 sixty days of its receipt of notice provided pursuant to 22 paragraph âcâ . 23 e. The withdrawing state is responsible for all dues, 24 obligations, and liabilities incurred throughout the effective 25 date of withdrawal, including obligations, the performance of 26 which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal. 27 f. Reinstatement following withdrawal of a member state 28 shall occur upon the withdrawing date reenacting the compact 29 or upon such later date as determined by the interstate 30 commission. 31 g. The interstate commission is authorized to develop rules 32 to address the impact of the withdrawal of a member state on 33 licenses granted in other member states to podiatric physicians 34 who designated the withdrawing member state as the state of 35 -21- LSB 2380HV (1) 91 ss/ko 21/ 23 H.F. 930 principal license. 1 22. Dissolution. 2 a. The compact shall be dissolved effective upon the date of 3 the withdrawal or default of the member state which reduces the 4 membership of the compact to one member state. 5 b.
