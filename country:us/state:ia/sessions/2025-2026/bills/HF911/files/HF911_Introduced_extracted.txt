The director of 34 the department of insurance and financial services (director) 35 -33- LSB 1437HV (2) 91 nls/ko 33/ 40 H.F. 911 shall be responsible for identifying and coordinating 1 appropriate opportunities for collaboration on financial 2 literacy and exploitation with the chief administrative 3 officers (CAO) of each division and each CAOâs respective 4 regulated entities. 5 The bill creates the education fund under the control of the 6 director. The director shall develop and implement financial 7 literacy and investor education initiatives for the public 8 by providing education on financial topics, including topics 9 required to be offered and taught for grades 9 through 12. The 10 education fund consists of moneys as detailed in the bill. 11 Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, moneys in 12 the education fund may be moved to the prevention fund at the 13 discretion of the director. 14 The bill creates the prevention fund, under which the 15 director shall develop and implement initiatives to educate 16 the public on financial exploitation; assist individuals 17 who are known, suspected, or potential victims of financial 18 exploitation; and to conduct investigations, refer 19 investigations to other law enforcement, and assist in the 20 prosecution of persons involved in financial exploitation. The 21 prevention fund consists of moneys as detailed in the bill. 22 All investigation files, investigation reports, and all 23 other investigative information in the possession of the 24 department of insurance and financial services (department) 25 shall be confidential and shall not be subject to release by 26 discovery, subpoena, or other means of legal compulsion until 27 opened for public inspection by the department, or upon the 28 consent of the department, or until a court determines the 29 department will not be unnecessarily hindered if opened for 30 public inspection. Investigative information in the possession 31 of the department may be disclosed, shared, or received in 32 the circumstances detailed in the bill. An investigator or 33 staff member of the department shall not be subject to subpoena 34 concerning any pending or continuing investigation conducted 35 -34- LSB 1437HV (2) 91 nls/ko 34/ 40 H.F. 911 by the department. 1 On the effective date of division I of the bill, all 2 unencumbered and unobligated moneys remaining in the securities 3 investor education and financial literacy training fund in Code 4 section 502.601 shall be transferred to the education fund. 5 DIVISION II ââ TAX ON GROSS PREMIUMS ââ CONFIDENTIALITY. 6 Under division II, a tax return filed under Code section 7 432.1 (tax on gross premiums ââ exclusions) or 432.1A (tax on 8 premiums ââ captive companies) shall not be open to inspection. 9 It shall be unlawful for any present or former officer or 10 employee of the state to willfully or recklessly publish any 11 such tax return. A person who does so is guilty of a serious 12 misdemeanor and, in addition to any other penalty, shall be 13 dismissed from office or discharged from employment. A serious 14 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one 15 year and a fine of at least $430 but no more than $2,560. The 16 bill does not prohibit the DOR from turning over information 17 and tax returns in the DORâs possession to duly authorized 18 officers of the United States or tax officials of other states 19 pursuant to an agreement. 20 DIVISION III ââ HEALTH INSURANCE RATE INCREASES ââ PUBLIC 21 HEARINGS. Division III permits the commissioner to hold a 22 public hearing at the time a carrier files for proposed health 23 insurance rate increases exceeding the average annual health 24 spending growth rate, rather than requiring the commissioner to 25 hold such public hearing as is the case under current law. 26 DIVISION IV ââ HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS AND QUALIFIED 27 HIGH-DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH PLANS ââ COST-SHARING. Under division 28 IV, if a copayment, coinsurance, or deductible paid as 29 cost-sharing by an enrollee in an individual or group accident 30 or health insurance plan would result in the enrollee becoming 31 ineligible for a health savings account associated with the 32 enrolleeâs qualified high-deductible health plan (HDHP), the 33 cost-sharing shall apply only to the enrolleeâs qualified HDHP 34 after the enrollee satisfies the enrolleeâs minimum deductible, 35 -35- LSB 1437HV (2) 91 nls/ko 35/ 40 H.F. 911 except for items or services determined to be preventive. 1 DIVISION V ââ INSURANCE COMPANY WITHDRAWAL REQUIREMENTS. 2 Division V requires an insurer, prior to withdrawing, to 3 file a withdrawal plan (plan) with the commissioner if the 4 insurer intends to reduce the insurerâs total annual premium 5 volume in the state by 50 percent or more, intends to reduce 6 the insurerâs total annual premium in the state in a line of 7 insurance by 75 percent or more, or intends to reduce the 8 insurerâs total annual premium volume in the state in a line of 9 private passenger automobile insurance, homeowners insurance, 10 or dwelling property insurance by 50 percent or more. 11 Withdrawal requirements do not apply to a transfer of business 12 from one insurer to another insurer that are both within the 13 same insurance holding company system if the insurer to whom 14 the business is being transferred is authorized to engage in 15 the business of insurance in the state, and the business is 16 not a reciprocal or interinsurance exchange, a lloydâs plan, 17 or a state or county mutual insurance association. âInsurerâ 18 is defined in the bill. 19 If the plan meets all of the requirements as described in 20 the bill, the commissioner shall approve the plan. If the 21 commissioner finds that a plan does not meet all requirements, 22 the commissioner may modify, restrict, limit, or deny the 23 withdrawal plan. An insurer may request a hearing on the 24 commissionerâs decision as described in the bill. 25 An insurer that withdraws from writing all lines of 26 insurance in the state shall not, without prior approval 27 of the commissioner, resume writing insurance in the state 28 for a minimum of five years. A violation of the withdrawal 29 requirements constitutes an unfair method of competition and 30 unfair or deceptive act or practice. The commissioner may 31 adopt rules to administer and enforce division V. 32 DIVISION VI ââ REPLACEMENT COST, ACTUAL CASH VALUE, AND 33 LINE OF SIGHT. Division VI requires for an insurance policy 34 providing for the adjustment and settlement of first-party 35 -36- LSB 1437HV (2) 91 nls/ko 36/ 40 H.F. 911 losses based on replacement cost when a loss requires repair or 1 replacement of a product or part, consequential physical damage 2 shall be included in the calculation of loss, and the insured 3 shall not be required to pay for betterment or other costs, 4 except for any deductible. When a loss requires replacement of 5 a damaged product and the product is available for purchase, 6 the identical product shall be used, or if it is not available, 7 the insurer shall use a reasonably similar product. 8 For a policy providing for adjustment and settlement of 9 first-party losses based on actual cash value (ACV), for 10 residential fire and extended coverage, the insurer shall 11 determine the ACV and shall provide a copy of the claim file 12 worksheet. 13 For an insurance policy providing for the adjustment and 14 settlement of first-party losses based on ACV, where the 15 insuredâs interest is limited because damaged property has 16 nominal or no economic value, or a value disproportionate to 17 replacement cost less depreciation, a determination of ACV 18 shall not be required. 19 DIVISION VII ââ SERVICE COMPANIES, SERVICE CONTRACTS, 20 AND LICENSES. Division VII prohibits a person who shall be 21 contractually obligated to a service contract holder under the 22 terms of a service contract from issuing, offering for sale, or 23 selling a motor vehicle service contract or residential service 24 contract in the state unless the person is a licensed service 25 company.

If the renewal application meets the 8 requirements, and the commissioner has not refused to renew 9 the license, the commissioner shall renew the license. If the 10 commissioner denies renewal, the denial shall be in writing. 11 If a service company fails to renew their license on or 12 before the final day of the license period, the companyâs 13 license shall be deemed expired. Prior to a license expiration 14 date, and if a renewal application was submitted at least 14 15 days prior to the license expiration date, the commissioner may 16 extend the renewal period an additional 30 calendar days. If a 17 service company submits an application or renewal application 18 after the license has expired, the service company shall pay a 19 $800 reinstatement fee and shall file a service company license 20 renewal application, including payment of applicable fees, with 21 the division. Restrictions on a service company whose license 22 term has expired are detailed in the bill. 23 A service contract shall not be issued, sold, or offered 24 for sale unless the service company provides a receipt for 25 the purchase of the service contract to the service contract 26 holder (holder), provides a complete sample copy of the service 27 contract prior to purchase, and provides a completed paper or 28 electronic copy of the service contract to the holder within 29 10 calendar days of purchase. A paper copy of the sample copy 30 of the service contract, or the service contract, shall be 31 provided upon the request of the consumer at the expense of the 32 service company. 33 A service contract issued, sold, or offered for sale in 34 the state shall comply with all of the requirements described 35 -38- LSB 1437HV (2) 91 nls/ko 38/ 40 H.F. 911 in the bill. The requirements for a reimbursement insurance 1 policy that relates to goods that are essential to the health 2 and safety of the service contract holder are detailed in the 3 bill. 4 A service company shall file with the division an accurate 5 copy of each service contract form prior to using the service 6 contract form and, at the time of filing shall pay a $35 fee for 7 each motor vehicle service contract form. A service company 8 may continue to use a noncompliant service contract form until 9 June 30, 2026, provided no changes are made to the form, and 10 the service contract form was filed with the division in 2024. 11 The commissioner may suspend or revoke the license of, deny 12 an application for license from, or refuse to renew the license 13 of, a service company, or may levy a civil penalty against a 14 service company, for any of the reasons described in the bill. 15 The commissioner shall notify the service company in writing 16 of the reason for the suspension, revocation, nonrenewal, or 17 denial. The licensee or applicant may request a hearing. 18 The commissioner may make examination of the books and 19 records of a service company. The actual costs of the 20 examination shall be borne by the service company, not to 21 exceed 10 percent of the service companyâs reported net income 22 associated with doing business in the state in the immediately 23 preceding fiscal year. 24 A service company that offers service contracts for sale, 25 or the service companyâs support services, shall not represent 26 in any manner a false, deceptive, or misleading statement with 27 respect to the service companyâs affiliation with a motor 28 vehicle manufacturer or importer, the validity or expiration of 29 a warranty, a motor vehicle service contract holderâs coverage 30 under a motor vehicle service contract, or describing the 31 service contract as a policy. 32 A service company shall not engage in a prohibited act or 33 practice as detailed in the bill.

If the commissioner 1 finds that a person has violated such rules, the commissioner 2 may order payment of a civil penalty as described in the bill, 3 or suspend or revoke a service companyâs license. A person 4 shall not engage in any unfair method of competition, or an 5 unfair or deceptive act or practice, in the service contract 6 business. 7 A written explanation to a service contract holder after a 8 licensed service company denies a claim or offers a compromise 9 settlement shall provide instructions to the service contract 10 holder on appeals, second reviews, arbitration, or similar 11 provisions included in the contract, as well as information 12 on how to file a complaint with the division, including the 13 internet site to the divisionâs complaint form. 14 The commissioner shall maintain the confidentiality of 15 information submitted to the division or obtained by the 16 division in the course of an investigation, examination, or 17 inquiry, including all notes, work papers, or other documents 18 and the information as described in the bill.
