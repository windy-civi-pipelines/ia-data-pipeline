34 Sec. ___. NEW SECTION. 135C.50 Electronic monitoring.
35 1. A resident or a resident representative may conduct
HF 309.1423 (2) 91
-1- dg/ko 1/11
1 electronic monitoring of the resident’s room through the use of
2 an electronic monitoring device placed in the resident’s room
3 pursuant to this subchapter.
4 2. Nothing in this section precludes the use of electronic
5 monitoring otherwise allowed by law.
6 Sec. ___. NEW SECTION. 135C.51 Consent to electronic
7 monitoring.
8 1. Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter,
9 a resident must consent to electronic monitoring in the
10 resident’s room in writing on a notification and consent
11 form prescribed by the department. If the resident has
12 not affirmatively objected to electronic monitoring and the
13 resident’s medical professional determines that the resident
14 lacks the ability to understand and appreciate the nature
15 and consequences of electronic monitoring, the resident
16 representative may consent on behalf of the resident. For
17 purposes of this subsection, a resident affirmatively objects
18 when the resident orally, visually, or through the use of
19 auxiliary aids or services declines electronic monitoring. The
20 resident’s response shall be documented on the notification and
21 consent form.
22 2. Prior to a resident representative consenting on behalf
23 of a resident, the resident shall be asked if the resident
24 wants electronic monitoring to be conducted. The resident
25 representative shall explain all of the following to the
26 resident:
27 a. The type of electronic monitoring device to be used.
28 b. The standard conditions or restrictions that may be
29 placed on the electronic monitoring device’s use including as
30 specified in the list of standard conditions or restrictions
31 contained in the notification and consent form completed by the
32 resident as provided in section 135C.54.
33 c. The dissemination and use of any recording as provided
34 under section 135C.58 or 135C.59.
35 d. The resident’s ability to decline all recordings.
HF 309.1423 (2) 91
-2- dg/ko 2/11
1 3. A resident, or resident representative when consenting
2 on behalf of the resident, may consent to electronic monitoring
3 with any conditions or restrictions of the resident’s or
4 resident representative’s choosing, including the list
5 of standard conditions or restrictions contained in the
6 notification and consent form completed by the resident
7 as provided in section 135C.54. A resident, or resident
8 representative when consenting on behalf of the resident, may
9 request that the electronic monitoring device be turned off
10 or the visual or audio recording component of the electronic
11 monitoring device be blocked at any time.
12 4. Prior to implementing electronic monitoring, a resident,
13 or resident representative when acting on behalf of the
14 resident, shall obtain the written consent on the notification
15 and consent form of any other resident who is a roommate
16 residing in the shared room. A roommate’s or roommate’s
17 resident representative’s written consent shall comply with
18 the requirements of this section. Consent by a roommate or
19 a roommate’s resident representative under this subsection
20 authorizes the resident’s use of any recording obtained under
21 this section as provided under sections 135C.58 and 135C.59.
22 5. Any resident conducting electronic monitoring shall
23 immediately remove or disable an electronic monitoring device
24 prior to a new resident who will be a roommate moving into
25 a shared room, unless the resident conducting electronic
26 monitoring obtains the new roommate’s or new roommate’s
27 resident representative’s written consent as provided under
28 this section prior to the new roommate moving into the shared
29 room. Upon obtaining the new roommate’s or new roommate’s
30 resident representative’s signed notification and consent form
31 and submitting the form to the nursing facility as required
32 under section 135C.53, the resident may resume electronic
33 monitoring.
34 6. The resident or roommate, or the resident representative
35 or roommate’s resident representative if the representative is
HF 309.1423 (2) 91
-3- dg/ko 3/11
1 consenting on behalf of the resident or roommate, may withdraw
2 consent at any time and the withdrawal of consent shall be
3 documented on the original consent form as provided under
4 section 135C.53.
5 Sec. ___. NEW SECTION. 135C.52 Refusal of roommate to
6 consent.
7 If a resident of a nursing facility who is residing in a
8 shared room, or the resident representative of such a resident
9 when acting on behalf of the resident, wants to conduct
10 electronic monitoring and another resident living in or moving
11 into the same shared room refuses to consent to the use of an
12 electronic monitoring device, the nursing facility shall make
13 a reasonable attempt to accommodate the resident who wants to
14 conduct electronic monitoring. A nursing facility has met
15 the requirement to make a reasonable attempt to accommodate
16 a resident or resident representative who wants to conduct
17 electronic monitoring when, upon notification that a roommate
18 has not consented to the use of an electronic monitoring device
19 in the resident’s room, the nursing facility offers to move one
20 of the residents to another shared room that is available at
21 the time of the request that accommodates the resident. If
22 a resident chooses to reside in a private room in order to
23 accommodate the use of an electronic monitoring device, the
24 resident shall be subject to a private room rate. If a nursing
25 facility is unable to accommodate a resident due to lack of
26 space, the nursing facility shall reevaluate the request
27 periodically until the request is fulfilled.
28 Sec. ___. NEW SECTION. 135C.53 Notice and consent form
29 submitted to nursing facility.
30 1. Electronic monitoring may begin only after the resident
31 or resident representative who intends to place an electronic

6 or roommate’s resident representative if the representative
7 is consenting on behalf of the resident or roommate, chooses
8 to alter the conditions under which consent to electronic
9 monitoring is given or chooses to withdraw consent to
10 electronic monitoring, the nursing facility shall make
11 available the original notification and consent form so that
12 the original form may be updated. Upon receipt of the updated
13 original form, the nursing facility shall place the updated
14 original form in the resident’s file. The nursing facility
15 shall provide a copy of the updated form to the resident and
16 the resident’s roommate, as applicable.

18 representative when consenting on behalf of the new roommate,
19 does not consent to electronic monitoring and submit a
20 completed notification and consent form to the nursing
21 facility, and the resident conducting the electronic monitoring
22 does not remove or disable an existing electronic monitoring
23 device, the nursing facility shall remove the electronic
24 monitoring device.

16 or both, that is placed in a resident’s room and is used to
17 monitor the resident or activities in the room.
18 3. “Resident” means an individual admitted to a nursing
19 facility in a manner prescribed in section 135C.23.
20 4. “Resident representative” means one of the following in
21 the order of priority listed, to the extent the person may

33 f. An adult sibling of the resident.
34 Sec. ___. NEW SECTION. 135C.50 Electronic monitoring.
35 1. A resident or a resident representative may conduct
HF 309.1423 (2) 91
-1- dg/ko 1/11

1 electronic monitoring of the resident’s room through the use of
2 an electronic monitoring device placed in the resident’s room
3 pursuant to this subchapter.
4 2. Nothing in this section precludes the use of electronic
5 monitoring otherwise allowed by law.
6 Sec. ___. NEW SECTION. 135C.51 Consent to electronic
7 monitoring.
8 1. Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter,
9 a resident must consent to electronic monitoring in the
10 resident’s room in writing on a notification and consent
11 form prescribed by the department. If the resident has
12 not affirmatively objected to electronic monitoring and the
13 resident’s medical professional determines that the resident
14 lacks the ability to understand and appreciate the nature
15 and consequences of electronic monitoring, the resident
16 representative may consent on behalf of the resident. For
17 purposes of this subsection, a resident affirmatively objects
18 when the resident orally, visually, or through the use of
19 auxiliary aids or services declines electronic monitoring. The
20 resident’s response shall be documented on the notification and
21 consent form.
22 2. Prior to a resident representative consenting on behalf
23 of a resident, the resident shall be asked if the resident
24 wants electronic monitoring to be conducted. The resident
25 representative shall explain all of the following to the
26 resident:
27 a. The type of electronic monitoring device to be used.
28 b. The standard conditions or restrictions that may be
29 placed on the electronic monitoring device’s use including as
30 specified in the list of standard conditions or restrictions
31 contained in the notification and consent form completed by the
32 resident as provided in section 135C.54.
33 c. The dissemination and use of any recording as provided
34 under section 135C.58 or 135C.59.
35 d. The resident’s ability to decline all recordings.
HF 309.1423 (2) 91
-2- dg/ko 2/11

1 3. A resident, or resident representative when consenting
2 on behalf of the resident, may consent to electronic monitoring
3 with any conditions or restrictions of the resident’s or
4 resident representative’s choosing, including the list
5 of standard conditions or restrictions contained in the
6 notification and consent form completed by the resident
7 as provided in section 135C.54. A resident, or resident
8 representative when consenting on behalf of the resident, may
9 request that the electronic monitoring device be turned off
10 or the visual or audio recording component of the electronic
11 monitoring device be blocked at any time.
12 4. Prior to implementing electronic monitoring, a resident,
13 or resident representative when acting on behalf of the
14 resident, shall obtain the written consent on the notification
15 and consent form of any other resident who is a roommate
16 residing in the shared room. A roommate’s or roommate’s
17 resident representative’s written consent shall comply with
18 the requirements of this section. Consent by a roommate or
19 a roommate’s resident representative under this subsection
20 authorizes the resident’s use of any recording obtained under
21 this section as provided under sections 135C.58 and 135C.59.
22 5. Any resident conducting electronic monitoring shall
23 immediately remove or disable an electronic monitoring device
24 prior to a new resident who will be a roommate moving into
25 a shared room, unless the resident conducting electronic
26 monitoring obtains the new roommate’s or new roommate’s
27 resident representative’s written consent as provided under
28 this section prior to the new roommate moving into the shared
29 room. Upon obtaining the new roommate’s or new roommate’s
30 resident representative’s signed notification and consent form
31 and submitting the form to the nursing facility as required
32 under section 135C.53, the resident may resume electronic
33 monitoring.
34 6. The resident or roommate, or the resident representative
35 or roommate’s resident representative if the representative is
HF 309.1423 (2) 91
-3- dg/ko 3/11

1 consenting on behalf of the resident or roommate, may withdraw
2 consent at any time and the withdrawal of consent shall be
3 documented on the original consent form as provided under
4 section 135C.53.
5 Sec. ___. NEW SECTION. 135C.52 Refusal of roommate to
6 consent.
7 If a resident of a nursing facility who is residing in a
8 shared room, or the resident representative of such a resident
9 when acting on behalf of the resident, wants to conduct
10 electronic monitoring and another resident living in or moving
11 into the same shared room refuses to consent to the use of an
12 electronic monitoring device, the nursing facility shall make
13 a reasonable attempt to accommodate the resident who wants to
14 conduct electronic monitoring. A nursing facility has met
15 the requirement to make a reasonable attempt to accommodate
16 a resident or resident representative who wants to conduct
17 electronic monitoring when, upon notification that a roommate
18 has not consented to the use of an electronic monitoring device
19 in the resident’s room, the nursing facility offers to move one
20 of the residents to another shared room that is available at
21 the time of the request that accommodates the resident. If
22 a resident chooses to reside in a private room in order to
23 accommodate the use of an electronic monitoring device, the
24 resident shall be subject to a private room rate. If a nursing
25 facility is unable to accommodate a resident due to lack of
26 space, the nursing facility shall reevaluate the request
27 periodically until the request is fulfilled.
28 Sec. ___. NEW SECTION. 135C.53 Notice and consent form
29 submitted to nursing facility.
30 1. Electronic monitoring may begin only after the resident
31 or resident representative who intends to place an electronic
32 monitoring device in the resident’s room and any roommate or
33 roommate’s resident representative completes a notification and
34 consent form and submits the form to the nursing facility.
35 2. Upon receipt of the required, completed notification and
HF 309.1423 (2) 91
-4- dg/ko 4/11

1 consent form, the nursing facility shall place the original
2 form in the resident’s file, and a copy of the form in any
3 roommate’s file. The nursing facility shall provide a copy to
4 the resident and the resident’s roommate, as applicable.
5 3. If a resident or roommate, or the resident representative
6 or roommate’s resident representative if the representative
7 is consenting on behalf of the resident or roommate, chooses
8 to alter the conditions under which consent to electronic
9 monitoring is given or chooses to withdraw consent to
10 electronic monitoring, the nursing facility shall make
11 available the original notification and consent form so that
12 the original form may be updated. Upon receipt of the updated
13 original form, the nursing facility shall place the updated
14 original form in the resident’s file. The nursing facility
15 shall provide a copy of the updated form to the resident and
16 the resident’s roommate, as applicable.
17 4. If a new roommate, or the new roommate’s resident
18 representative when consenting on behalf of the new roommate,
19 does not consent to electronic monitoring and submit a
20 completed notification and consent form to the nursing
21 facility, and the resident conducting the electronic monitoring
22 does not remove or disable an existing electronic monitoring
23 device, the nursing facility shall remove the electronic
24 monitoring device.
25 5. If a roommate, or the roommate’s resident representative
26 when withdrawing consent on behalf of the roommate, submits
27 an updated notification and consent form withdrawing consent
28 and the resident conducting electronic monitoring does not
29 remove or disable the electronic monitoring device, the nursing
30 facility shall remove the electronic monitoring device.
