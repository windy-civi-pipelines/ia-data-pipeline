BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF IOWA:

Section 2:
Section 1. Section 335.15, Code 2025, is amended by adding
the following new subsection:
NEW SUBSECTION. 4. To authorize on appeal, in specific
cases, such variance from the terms of the ordinance
with respect to the area, dimensional, or other numerical
limitations as will not be contrary to the public interest,
where owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of
the provisions of the ordinance will result in practical
difficulties to the property owner in making a beneficial use
of the property allowed by the zoning ordinance, and so that
the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed and substantial
justice done. Area, dimensional, or other numerical
limitations subject to variances include but are not limited
to requirements for minimum lot size, setbacks, yard widths,
height, bulk, sidewalks, fencing, signage, and off-street
parking. To receive the requested area, dimensional, or
other numerical variance, the property owner must prove that
the practical difficulties faced are unique to the property
at issue and not self-created and must also demonstrate
that granting the variance will not significantly alter the
essential character of the surrounding neighborhood.

Sec. 2. Section 414.12, Code 2025, is amended by adding the
following new subsection:
NEW SUBSECTION. 4. To authorize on appeal, in specific
