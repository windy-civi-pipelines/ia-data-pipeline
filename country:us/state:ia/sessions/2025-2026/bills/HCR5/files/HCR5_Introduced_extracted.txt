When a bill which originated in one house 22 chamber is amended in the other house chamber , the 23 house chamber originating the bill may amend the 24 amendment, concur in full in the amendment, or refuse 25 to concur in full in the amendment. Precedence of 26 motions shall be in that order. The amendment of the 27 other house chamber shall not be ruled out of order 28 based on a question of germaneness. An amendment 29 of one chamber to an amendment adopted in the other 30 -6- LSB 1739HV (2) 91 tm/jh 6/ 22 H.C.R. 5 chamber is an amendment only in the first degree. 1 a. If the house chamber originating the bill 2 concurs in the amendment, the bill shall then be 3 immediately placed upon its final passage. 4 b. If the house chamber originating the bill 5 refuses to concur in the amendment, the bill shall be 6 returned to the amending house chamber which shall 7 either: 8 (1) Recede, after which the bill shall be read for 9 the last time and immediately placed upon its final 10 passage; or 11 (2) Insist, which will send the bill to a 12 conference committee. 13 c. If the house chamber originating the bill amends 14 the amendment, that house chamber shall concur in the 15 amendment as amended and the bill shall be immediately 16 placed on final passage, and shall be returned to the 17 other house chamber . The other house chamber cannot 18 further amend the bill. 19 (1) If the amending house chamber which gave second 20 consideration to the bill concurs in the amendment 21 to the amendment, the bill shall then be immediately 22 placed upon its final passage. 23 (2) If the amending house chamber refuses to concur 24 in the amendment to the amendment, the bill shall be 25 returned to the house chamber originating the bill 26 which shall either: 27 (a) Recede, after which the bill shall be read for 28 the last time as amended and immediately placed upon 29 its final passage; or 30 -7- LSB 1739HV (2) 91 tm/jh 7/ 22 H.C.R. 5 (b) Insist, which will send the bill to a 1 conference committee. 2 2. A motion to recede has precedence over a motion 3 to insist. Failure to recede means to insist; and 4 failure to insist means to recede. 5 3. A motion to lay on the table or to indefinitely 6 postpone shall be out of order with respect to motions 7 to recede from or insist upon and to amendments to 8 bills which have passed both houses chambers . 9 4. A motion to concur, refuse to concur, recede, 10 insist, or adopt a conference committee report is in 11 order even though the subject matter has previously 12 been acted upon. 13 Rule 13 14 Conference Committee 15 1. Within one legislative day after either 16 house chamber insists upon an amendment to a bill, 17 the presiding officer speaker of the house, after 18 consultation with the majority leader, shall appoint 19 three majority party members and, after consultation 20 with the minority leader, shall appoint two minority 21 party members to a conference committee. The majority 22 leader of the senate, after consultation with the 23 president, shall appoint three majority party members 24 and, after consultation with and approval by the 25 minority leader, shall appoint two minority party 26 members to a conference committee.

The authority of the first conference committee 3 shall cover only issues related to provisions of the 4 bill and amendments to the bill which were adopted 5 by either the senate or the house of representatives 6 and on which the senate and house of representatives 7 differed. If a conference committee report is not 8 acted upon because such action would violate this 9 subsection of this rule, the inaction on the report 10 shall constitute refusal to adopt the conference 11 committee report and shall have the same effect as if 12 the conference committee had disagreed. 13 4. An agreement on recommendations must be approved 14 by a majority of the committee members from each house 15 chamber . The committee shall submit two originals 16 of the report signed by a majority of the committee 17 members of each house chamber with one signed original 18 and three copies to be submitted to each house chamber . 19 The report shall first be acted upon in the house 20 chamber originating the bill. Such action, including 21 all papers, shall be immediately referred by the 22 secretary of the senate or the chief clerk of the house 23 of representatives to the other house chamber . 24 5. The report of agreement is debatable, but 25 cannot be amended. If the report contains recommended 26 amendments to the bill, adoption of the report shall 27 automatically adopt all amendments contained therein. 28 After the report is adopted, there shall be no more 29 debate, and the bill shall immediately be placed upon 30 -9- LSB 1739HV (2) 91 tm/jh 9/ 22 H.C.R. 5 its final passage. 1 6. Refusal of either house chamber to adopt the 2 conference committee report has the same effect as if 3 the committee had disagreed. 4 7. If the conference committee fails to reach 5 agreement, a report of such failure signed by a 6 majority of the committee members of each house chamber 7 shall be given promptly to each house chamber . The 8 bill shall be returned to the house chamber that 9 originated the bill, the members of the committee 10 shall be immediately discharged, and a new conference 11 committee appointed in the same manner as the first 12 conference committee. 13 8. The authority of a second or subsequent 14 conference committee shall cover free conference during 15 which the committee has authority to propose amendments 16 to any portion of a bill provided the amendment is 17 within the subject matter content of the bill as passed 18 by the house chamber of origin or as amended by the 19 second house chamber . 20 Rule 14 21 Enrollment and Authentication of Bills 22 A bill or resolution which has passed both houses 23 chambers shall be enrolled in the house chamber of 24 origin under the direction of either the secretary 25 of the senate or the chief clerk of the house and its 26 house chamber of origin shall be certified by the 27 endorsement of the secretary of the senate or the chief 28 clerk of the house. 29 After enrollment, each bill shall be signed by the 30 -10- LSB 1739HV (2) 91 tm/jh 10/ 22 H.C.R. 5 president of the senate and by the speaker of the 1 house. 2 Rule 15 3 Concerning Other Enrollments 4 All resolutions and other matters which are to 5 be presented to the governor for approval shall be 6 enrolled, signed, and presented in the same manner as 7 bills. 8 All resolutions and other matters which are not to 9 be presented to the governor or the secretary of state 10 shall be enrolled, signed, and retained permanently 11 by the secretary of the senate or chief clerk of the 12 house. 13 Rule 16 14 Transmission of Bills to the Governor 15 After a bill has been signed in each house chamber , 16 it shall be presented by the house chamber of origin 17 to the governor by either the secretary of the senate 18 or the chief clerk of the house.

Unless the requestor specifies the request is 22 to be confidential, upon completion of the bill draft, 23 the legal services staff shall immediately send a copy 24 to the fiscal services director for review. 25 When a committee reports a bill to the floor, the 26 committee shall state in the report whether a fiscal 27 note is or is not required. 28 The fiscal services director or the directorâs 29 designee shall review all bills placed on the senate 30 -12- LSB 1739HV (2) 91 tm/jh 12/ 22 H.C.R. 5 or house calendars to determine whether the bills are 1 subject to this rule. 2 Additionally, a legislator may request the 3 preparation of a fiscal note by the fiscal services 4 staff for any bill or joint resolution introduced which 5 reasonably could be subject to this rule. 6 The fiscal services director or the directorâs 7 designee shall cause to be prepared and shall approve 8 a fiscal note within a reasonable time after receiving 9 a request or determining that a bill is subject to 10 this rule. All fiscal notes approved by the fiscal 11 services director shall be transmitted immediately to 12 the secretary of the senate or the chief clerk of the 13 house, after notifying the sponsor of the bill that a 14 fiscal note has been prepared, for publication in the 15 daily clip sheet.

However, a 24 request for a revised fiscal note shall not delay 25 action on a bill unless so ordered by the presiding 26 officer of the house chamber in which the bill is under 27 consideration. 28 If a date for adjournment has been set, then a 29 constitutional majority of the house chamber in which 30 -13- LSB 1739HV (2) 91 tm/jh 13/ 22 H.C.R. 5 the bill is under consideration may waive the fiscal 1 note requirement during the three days prior to the 2 date set for adjournment. 3 Rule 18 4 Legislative Interns Reserved 5 Legislators may arrange student internships during 6 the legislative session with Iowa college, university, 7 or law school students, for which the students may 8 receive college credit at the discretion of their 9 schools.

When a bill which originated in one house 22 chamber is amended in the other house chamber , the 23 house chamber originating the bill may amend the 24 amendment, concur in full in the amendment, or refuse 25 to concur in full in the amendment. Precedence of 26 motions shall be in that order. The amendment of the 27 other house chamber shall not be ruled out of order 28 based on a question of germaneness. An amendment 29 of one chamber to an amendment adopted in the other 30 -6- LSB 1739HV (2) 91 tm/jh 6/ 22 H.C.R. 5 chamber is an amendment only in the first degree. 1 a. If the house chamber originating the bill 2 concurs in the amendment, the bill shall then be 3 immediately placed upon its final passage. 4 b. If the house chamber originating the bill 5 refuses to concur in the amendment, the bill shall be 6 returned to the amending house chamber which shall 7 either: 8 (1) Recede, after which the bill shall be read for 9 the last time and immediately placed upon its final 10 passage; or 11 (2) Insist, which will send the bill to a 12 conference committee. 13 c. If the house chamber originating the bill amends 14 the amendment, that house chamber shall concur in the 15 amendment as amended and the bill shall be immediately 16 placed on final passage, and shall be returned to the 17 other house chamber . The other house chamber cannot 18 further amend the bill. 19 (1) If the amending house chamber which gave second 20 consideration to the bill concurs in the amendment 21 to the amendment, the bill shall then be immediately 22 placed upon its final passage. 23 (2) If the amending house chamber refuses to concur 24 in the amendment to the amendment, the bill shall be 25 returned to the house chamber originating the bill 26 which shall either: 27 (a) Recede, after which the bill shall be read for 28 the last time as amended and immediately placed upon 29 its final passage; or 30 -7- LSB 1739HV (2) 91 tm/jh 7/ 22 H.C.R. 5 (b) Insist, which will send the bill to a 1 conference committee. 2 2. A motion to recede has precedence over a motion 3 to insist. Failure to recede means to insist; and 4 failure to insist means to recede. 5 3. A motion to lay on the table or to indefinitely 6 postpone shall be out of order with respect to motions 7 to recede from or insist upon and to amendments to 8 bills which have passed both houses chambers . 9 4. A motion to concur, refuse to concur, recede, 10 insist, or adopt a conference committee report is in 11 order even though the subject matter has previously 12 been acted upon. 13 Rule 13 14 Conference Committee 15 1. Within one legislative day after either 16 house chamber insists upon an amendment to a bill, 17 the presiding officer speaker of the house, after 18 consultation with the majority leader, shall appoint 19 three majority party members and, after consultation 20 with the minority leader, shall appoint two minority 21 party members to a conference committee. The majority 22 leader of the senate, after consultation with the 23 president, shall appoint three majority party members 24 and, after consultation with and approval by the 25 minority leader, shall appoint two minority party 26 members to a conference committee. The papers shall 27 remain with the house chamber that originated the bill. 28 2. The conference committee shall meet before 29 the end of the next legislative day after their 30 -8- LSB 1739HV (2) 91 tm/jh 8/ 22 H.C.R. 5 appointment, shall select a chair and shall discuss the 1 controversy. 2 3. The authority of the first conference committee 3 shall cover only issues related to provisions of the 4 bill and amendments to the bill which were adopted 5 by either the senate or the house of representatives 6 and on which the senate and house of representatives 7 differed. If a conference committee report is not 8 acted upon because such action would violate this 9 subsection of this rule, the inaction on the report 10 shall constitute refusal to adopt the conference 11 committee report and shall have the same effect as if 12 the conference committee had disagreed. 13 4. An agreement on recommendations must be approved 14 by a majority of the committee members from each house 15 chamber . The committee shall submit two originals 16 of the report signed by a majority of the committee 17 members of each house chamber with one signed original 18 and three copies to be submitted to each house chamber . 19 The report shall first be acted upon in the house 20 chamber originating the bill. Such action, including 21 all papers, shall be immediately referred by the 22 secretary of the senate or the chief clerk of the house 23 of representatives to the other house chamber . 24 5. The report of agreement is debatable, but 25 cannot be amended. If the report contains recommended 26 amendments to the bill, adoption of the report shall 27 automatically adopt all amendments contained therein. 28 After the report is adopted, there shall be no more 29 debate, and the bill shall immediately be placed upon 30 -9- LSB 1739HV (2) 91 tm/jh 9/ 22 H.C.R. 5 its final passage. 1 6. Refusal of either house chamber to adopt the 2 conference committee report has the same effect as if 3 the committee had disagreed. 4 7. If the conference committee fails to reach 5 agreement, a report of such failure signed by a 6 majority of the committee members of each house chamber 7 shall be given promptly to each house chamber . The 8 bill shall be returned to the house chamber that 9 originated the bill, the members of the committee 10 shall be immediately discharged, and a new conference 11 committee appointed in the same manner as the first 12 conference committee. 13 8. The authority of a second or subsequent 14 conference committee shall cover free conference during 15 which the committee has authority to propose amendments 16 to any portion of a bill provided the amendment is 17 within the subject matter content of the bill as passed 18 by the house chamber of origin or as amended by the 19 second house chamber . 20 Rule 14 21 Enrollment and Authentication of Bills 22 A bill or resolution which has passed both houses 23 chambers shall be enrolled in the house chamber of 24 origin under the direction of either the secretary 25 of the senate or the chief clerk of the house and its 26 house chamber of origin shall be certified by the 27 endorsement of the secretary of the senate or the chief 28 clerk of the house. 29 After enrollment, each bill shall be signed by the 30 -10- LSB 1739HV (2) 91 tm/jh 10/ 22 H.C.R. 5 president of the senate and by the speaker of the 1 house. 2 Rule 15 3 Concerning Other Enrollments 4 All resolutions and other matters which are to 5 be presented to the governor for approval shall be 6 enrolled, signed, and presented in the same manner as 7 bills. 8 All resolutions and other matters which are not to 9 be presented to the governor or the secretary of state 10 shall be enrolled, signed, and retained permanently 11 by the secretary of the senate or chief clerk of the 12 house. 13 Rule 16 14 Transmission of Bills to the Governor 15 After a bill has been signed in each house chamber , 16 it shall be presented by the house chamber of origin 17 to the governor by either the secretary of the senate 18 or the chief clerk of the house. The secretary or the 19 chief clerk shall report the date of the presentation, 20 which shall be entered upon the journal of the house 21 chamber of origin. 22 Rule 17 23 Fiscal Notes 24 A fiscal note shall be attached to any bill or joint 25 resolution which reasonably could have an annual effect 26 of at least one five hundred thousand dollars or a 27 combined total effect within five years after enactment 28 of two million five hundred thousand dollars or more 29 on the aggregate revenues, expenditures, or fiscal 30 -11- LSB 1739HV (2) 91 tm/jh 11/ 22 H.C.R. 5 liability of the state or its subdivisions. This rule 1 does not apply to appropriation and ways and means 2 measures where the total effect is stated in dollar 3 amounts. 4 Each fiscal note shall state in dollars the 5 estimated effect of the bill on the revenues, 6 expenditures, and fiscal liability of the state or 7 its subdivisions during the first five years after 8 enactment.

If an accurate estimate cannot be made, the 15 fiscal note shall state the best available estimate or 16 shall state that no dollar estimate can be made and 17 state concisely the reason. 18 The preliminary determination of whether the bill 19 appears to require a fiscal note shall be made by 20 the legal services staff of the legislative services 21 agency. Unless the requestor specifies the request is 22 to be confidential, upon completion of the bill draft, 23 the legal services staff shall immediately send a copy 24 to the fiscal services director for review. 25 When a committee reports a bill to the floor, the 26 committee shall state in the report whether a fiscal 27 note is or is not required. 28 The fiscal services director or the directorâs 29 designee shall review all bills placed on the senate 30 -12- LSB 1739HV (2) 91 tm/jh 12/ 22 H.C.R. 5 or house calendars to determine whether the bills are 1 subject to this rule. 2 Additionally, a legislator may request the 3 preparation of a fiscal note by the fiscal services 4 staff for any bill or joint resolution introduced which 5 reasonably could be subject to this rule. 6 The fiscal services director or the directorâs 7 designee shall cause to be prepared and shall approve 8 a fiscal note within a reasonable time after receiving 9 a request or determining that a bill is subject to 10 this rule. All fiscal notes approved by the fiscal 11 services director shall be transmitted immediately to 12 the secretary of the senate or the chief clerk of the 13 house, after notifying the sponsor of the bill that a 14 fiscal note has been prepared, for publication in the 15 daily clip sheet. The secretary of the senate or chief 16 clerk of the house shall attach the fiscal note to the 17 bill as soon as it is available. 18 The fiscal services director may request the 19 cooperation of any state department or agency in 20 preparing a fiscal note. 21 A revised fiscal note may be requested by a 22 legislator if the fiscal effect of the bill has been 23 changed by adoption of an amendment. However, a 24 request for a revised fiscal note shall not delay 25 action on a bill unless so ordered by the presiding 26 officer of the house chamber in which the bill is under 27 consideration. 28 If a date for adjournment has been set, then a 29 constitutional majority of the house chamber in which 30 -13- LSB 1739HV (2) 91 tm/jh 13/ 22 H.C.R. 5 the bill is under consideration may waive the fiscal 1 note requirement during the three days prior to the 2 date set for adjournment. 3 Rule 18 4 Legislative Interns Reserved 5 Legislators may arrange student internships during 6 the legislative session with Iowa college, university, 7 or law school students, for which the students may 8 receive college credit at the discretion of their 9 schools.
