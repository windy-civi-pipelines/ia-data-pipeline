The federal 11 exemption must authorize any vehicle that is not prohibited 12 from being operated on the segment prior to the date of 13 designation as an interstate road to continue to be operated on 14 the segment after designation as an interstate road. 15 Sec. 2.

The department of 10 transportation (DOT) may authorize an implement of husbandry to 11 be operated on the segment farther west beyond the intersection 12 with U.S. highway 69. 13 Under current law, an âimplement of husbandryâ means a 14 vehicle or special mobile equipment manufactured, designed, 15 or reconstructed for agricultural purposes and, except 16 for incidental uses, is exclusively used in the conduct of 17 agricultural operations. To be considered an implement of 18 husbandry, a self-propelled qualifying vehicle must be operated 19 at speeds of 35 MPH or less. 20 The bill prohibits the DOT and the state transportation 21 commission from pursuing an interstate road designation for 22 the segment extending between the segmentâs intersections with 23 interstate 35 and interstate 80 unless the U.S. government 24 provides an exemption from federal regulations regarding 25 vehicle weight and size on that segment, as described in the 26 bill. 27 The bill appropriates moneys from the general fund of the 28 state to the DOT to conduct an alternative highway study to 29 develop and implement an accessible alternative highway route 30 suitable for implements of husbandry. 31 The bill applies to the segment on the effective date of the 32 bill, and will continue to apply to the segment regardless of 33 whether the highwayâs designation is subsequently changed. 34 -3- LSB 1322YH (7) 91 th/ns 3/ 3
