NEW SECTION . 358A.2 Legislative intent. 6 The general assembly finds and declares all of the 7 following: 8 1. Iowaâs communities are important to the social and 9 economic vitality of this state. Whether urban, suburban, 10 or rural, many communities are struggling with dilapidated, 11 abandoned, blighted, and tax-delinquent properties. 12 2. Citizens of Iowa are affected adversely by dilapidated, 13 abandoned, blighted, and tax-delinquent properties, 14 including properties that have been abandoned due to mortgage 15 foreclosure. 16 3. Dilapidated, abandoned, blighted, and tax-delinquent 17 properties impose significant costs on neighborhoods and 18 communities by lowering property values, increasing fire 19 and police protection costs, decreasing tax revenues, and 20 undermining community cohesion. 21 4. There is an overwhelming public need to confront the 22 problems caused by dilapidated, abandoned, blighted, and 23 tax-delinquent properties; to return properties that are in 24 non-revenue-generating, non-tax-producing status to productive 25 status in order to revitalize urban, suburban, and rural 26 areas, provide affordable housing, and attract new industry; 27 and to create jobs for the citizens of this state through the 28 establishment of new tools that enable communities to turn 29 abandoned spaces into vibrant places. 30 5. Land redevelopment trusts are one of the tools that 31 communities can use to facilitate the return of dilapidated, 32 abandoned, blighted, and tax-delinquent properties to 33 productive use. 34 Sec. 3.
