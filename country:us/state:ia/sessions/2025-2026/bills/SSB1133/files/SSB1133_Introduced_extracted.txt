The moneys are collected by the producerâs first 29 purchaser, if the sale is at a concentration point (e.g., a 30 stockyard or market). Otherwise, the moneys are collected by 31 the producer. In any case, the collected moneys are deposited 32 into an account in a financial institution under the boardâs 33 control. The board is required to use the collected moneys to 34 support efforts to promote markets for sheep and wool products 35 -9- LSB 1596XC (1) 91 da/ns 9/ 10 S.F. _____ and further related research and education efforts (Code 1 section 182.11). The assessment rate is 2 cents for each pound 2 of wool and 10 cents per head of sheep subject to an increased 3 per-head rate of 25 cents or higher by board action if approved 4 by referendum (Code section 182.13B). 5 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ ELIMINATION OF WOOL. The bill changes 6 the boardâs name to the Iowa sheep promotion board. A producer 7 is limited to a person in the business of producing and selling 8 sheep. The per-pound wool assessment is eliminated and the 9 base per-head assessment is established at 20 cents subject to 10 current procedures that allow for an increase by referendum 11 (Code section 182.13B). The renamed board may establish a 12 system that provides for electronic funds transfer by a first 13 purchaser, at a concentration point, outside the concentration 14 point, or outside the state. Moneys from the assessment must 15 be used to support increasing markets, education, and research 16 involving sheep and sheep products which includes an item 17 derived from a live or slaughtered sheep, including but not 18 limited to bones, milk, manure, mutton or lamb, sheepskin, or 19 wool. 20 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ TRANSITION PROVISIONS. The bill does 21 not affect the terms of members of the former Iowa sheep and 22 wool promotion board who will continue to serve as members of 23 the Iowa sheep promotion board until the expiration of the 24 memberâs term. The per-head assessment rate of 20 cents is 25 implemented without a referendum. The assessment rate takes 26 effect on September 1, 2025, unless the board elects an earlier 27 effective date by resolution. Until then, the assessment rate 28 is the same as prior to the effective date of the bill. The 29 bill does not limit the power of producers to terminate the 30 board and assessment by referendum (Code section 182.4). 31 -10- LSB 1596XC (1) 91 da/ns 10/ 10

The moneys are collected by the producerâs first 29 purchaser, if the sale is at a concentration point (e.g., a 30 stockyard or market). Otherwise, the moneys are collected by 31 the producer. In any case, the collected moneys are deposited 32 into an account in a financial institution under the boardâs 33 control. The board is required to use the collected moneys to 34 support efforts to promote markets for sheep and wool products 35 -9- LSB 1596XC (1) 91 da/ns 9/ 10 S.F. _____ and further related research and education efforts (Code 1 section 182.11). The assessment rate is 2 cents for each pound 2 of wool and 10 cents per head of sheep subject to an increased 3 per-head rate of 25 cents or higher by board action if approved 4 by referendum (Code section 182.13B). 5 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ ELIMINATION OF WOOL. The bill changes 6 the boardâs name to the Iowa sheep promotion board. A producer 7 is limited to a person in the business of producing and selling 8 sheep. The per-pound wool assessment is eliminated and the 9 base per-head assessment is established at 20 cents subject to 10 current procedures that allow for an increase by referendum 11 (Code section 182.13B). The renamed board may establish a 12 system that provides for electronic funds transfer by a first 13 purchaser, at a concentration point, outside the concentration 14 point, or outside the state. Moneys from the assessment must 15 be used to support increasing markets, education, and research 16 involving sheep and sheep products which includes an item 17 derived from a live or slaughtered sheep, including but not 18 limited to bones, milk, manure, mutton or lamb, sheepskin, or 19 wool. 20 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ TRANSITION PROVISIONS. The bill does 21 not affect the terms of members of the former Iowa sheep and 22 wool promotion board who will continue to serve as members of 23 the Iowa sheep promotion board until the expiration of the 24 memberâs term. The per-head assessment rate of 20 cents is 25 implemented without a referendum. The assessment rate takes 26 effect on September 1, 2025, unless the board elects an earlier 27 effective date by resolution. Until then, the assessment rate 28 is the same as prior to the effective date of the bill. The 29 bill does not limit the power of producers to terminate the 30 board and assessment by referendum (Code section 182.4). 31 -10- LSB 1596XC (1) 91 da/ns 10/ 10
