NEW SECTION . 203D.6A Repayment claims against 26 fund. 27 1. A separate indemnity claim process is established to 28 provide for the indemnification of a repayment loss incurred by 29 a seller against a grain dealer who is a debtor in bankruptcy 30 under the protections provided in Tit. 11 of the United States 31 Code. 32 a.

A seller may file an eligible claim for a loss under 35 -7- LSB 2711SV (2) 91 da/ns 7/ 17 S.F. 608 section 203D.6 and an eligible repayment claim for a repayment 1 loss under this section. 2 2. To be timely, a seller must file a repayment claim with 3 the department not later than sixty days after the repayment 4 loss is finalized by a bankruptcy court, whether by an order 5 issued, judgment entered, or settlement agreement approved. 6 3. The department may provide notice of the repayment claim 7 process to a seller that may become or has become subject to 8 an order issued, judgment entered, or settlement agreement 9 approved by a bankruptcy court that requires the seller to 10 pay back amounts previously received for grain purchased by a 11 licensed grain dealer, in the bankruptcy of the grain dealer. 12 If the department chooses to provide a notice to the seller, it 13 shall have discretion to determine any reasonable method and 14 manner of providing such notice. A failure by the department 15 to provide a notice or a failure by a seller to receive a notice 16 under this subsection, does not relieve the seller of the 17 requirement to timely file a repayment claim. 18 4. The board shall determine that a repayment claim is 19 eligible for payment from the fund if the board finds all of 20 the following: 21 a. The repayment claim was timely filed. 22 b. The repayment claimant qualifies as a seller. 23 c. The repayment claim derives from a covered transaction. 24 For purposes of this paragraph, a claim derives from a covered 25 transaction if the claimant is a seller who transferred title 26 to the grain to a licensed grain dealer within six months of 27 the incurrence date as provided in section 203D.6, subsection 28 2. 29 d. The seller submits adequate proof to establish the 30 repayment claim and the amount of the repayment loss. 31 e. A claim has not been paid for the same repayment loss. 32 5. A seller is not entitled to indemnify a claim for a 33 repayment loss if the repayment loss is incurred as a result of 34 a fraudulent transfer or conveyance by the seller. 35 -8- LSB 2711SV (2) 91 da/ns 8/ 17 S.F. 608 6. The dollar value of a repayment claim is the amount a 1 seller is required to pay back that was previously received for 2 the grain as a result of an order issued, judgment entered, 3 or settlement agreement approved by a bankruptcy court and 4 which has not been recovered through other legal or equitable 5 remedies including the liquidation of assets. 6 7. The department acting on behalf of the board shall 7 deliver a notice to a seller filing a claim under this section. 8 The notice must include the boardâs determination of the 9 sellerâs eligibility and the value of the sellerâs repayment 10 loss. Within twenty days of delivering the notice, the seller 11 may request a hearing for the review of either determination. 12 The request shall be made in the manner provided by the 13 board. The hearing and any further appeal shall be conducted 14 as a contested case subject to chapter 17A. A seller whose 15 repayment claim has been refused by the board may appeal the 16 refusal to either the district court of Polk county or the 17 district court of the county in which the seller resides. 18 8. Upon a determination that the claim is eligible for 19 indemnification, the board shall provide for payment of ninety 20 percent of the repayment loss, as determined by the board, 21 but not more than three hundred thousand dollars counting 22 the dollar value losses paid to the same grain dealer during 23 the claim period as provided in section 203D.6. If at any 24 time the board determines that there are insufficient moneys 25 in the fund to make payment of all claims under section 26 203D.6 and this section, the board may order that payment be 27 deferred on specified claims. The department, upon the boardâs 28 instruction, shall hold the claims for deferred payment until 29 the board determines that the fund again contains sufficient 30 assets. 31 9. In the event of the payment of a repayment loss under 32 this section, the fund is subrogated to the extent of the 33 amount of any payments to all rights, powers, privileges, 34 and remedies of the seller against any person regarding 35 -9- LSB 2711SV (2) 91 da/ns 9/ 17 S.F. 608 the repayment loss. The seller shall render all necessary 1 assistance to the department and the board in securing the 2 rights granted in this section. No action or claim initiated 3 by a seller and pending at the time of payment from the fund 4 shall be compromised or settled without the consent of the 5 board. 6 10. a. A repayment claim shall expire if five years after 7 the board determines that the repayment claim is eligible, and 8 the claimant has failed to do any of the following: 9 (1) Provide for the fundâs subrogation or render all 10 necessary assistance to the department and the board in 11 securing the departmentâs rights of subrogation as required in 12 this section. 13 (2) Provide necessary documentation or information required 14 by the board in order to process the repayment claim. 15 b.

The department of agriculture and land stewardship shall 32 send a copy of the notice to the Code editor at least two 33 weeks prior to the publication date of the Iowa administrative 34 bulletin as described in subsection l. 35 -11- LSB 2711SV (2) 91 da/ns 11/ 17 S.F. 608 EXPLANATION 1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 2 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 3 BACKGROUND ââ GRAIN DEALERS AND WAREHOUSE OPERATORS. This 4 bill amends provisions regulating marketers of grain, referred 5 to as grain dealers purchasing grain (Code chapter 203), and 6 warehouse operators storing grain under bailment (Code chapter 7 203C), administered by the department of agriculture and land 8 stewardship (DALS). 9 DIVISION I BACKGROUND ââ GRAIN DEPOSITORS AND SELLERS 10 INDEMNITY FUND. A person selling grain to a licensed grain 11 dealer (seller) or a person depositing grain with a licensed 12 warehouse operator (depositor) may be reimbursed for a loss 13 incurred by the failure of the licensee to honor a contractual 14 obligation regarding the transaction (Code section 203D.6). A 15 payment is made from the grain depositors and sellers indemnity 16 fund (indemnity fund) upon a determination that the claim is 17 eligible for payment by the Iowa grain indemnity fund board 18 (indemnity board) acting in cooperation with DALS. 19 DIVISION I BACKGROUND ââ FEES. In addition to license fees 20 deposited into the general fund of the state (Code sections 21 203.6 and 203C.33), each licensee may be required to pay 22 either one or two special fees (indemnity fees) to support 23 the indemnity fund, referred to as a participation fee and 24 per-bushel fee. The licensed grain dealerâs participation 25 fee is calculated according to the following formula: the 26 assessment rate of not more than $0.014 multiplied by all 27 bushels of purchased grain during the grain dealerâs prior 28 fiscal year with a minimum of $50 and no maximum limit. The 29 licensed grain dealerâs per-bushel fee is calculated according 30 to a similar formula: the assessment rate of not more than 31 $0.25 multiplied by all bushels of purchased grain for the 32 grain dealerâs assessment year with no minimum and a $500 33 maximum limit. The qualifying term âpurchased grainâ equals 34 the total number of bushels purchased from sellers minus a 35 -12- LSB 2711SV (2) 91 da/ns 12/ 17 S.F. 608 number of exempt bushel purchases, including those purchased 1 under credit-sale contract (Code section 203D.1). Purchased 2 grain is reported to DALS as âpaid company-ownedâ (Code section 3 203D.1). The licensed warehouse operatorâs participation 4 fee is $0.014 multiplied by the number of bushels of storage 5 capacity of the warehouse (Code section 203D.5). 6 DIVISION I BACKGROUND ââ INDEMNITY BOARD REVIEW OF INDEMNITY 7 FUND. The indemnity board must annually review the debits 8 of and credits to the indemnity fund and by May 1 determine 9 whether the balance triggers a waiver or reinstatement (Code 10 section 203D.5). The triggered waiver or reinstatement is 11 effective on the first day of the following assessment year 12 (September 1). If a waiver is triggered on the last day of an 13 assessment year, a licensee is subject to pay the outstanding 14 amount of the participation fee that is otherwise owing for 15 the current assessment year. However, a licensed grain dealer 16 is no longer obligated to pay the outstanding amount of the 17 per-bushel fee otherwise owing for that period, unless the 18 amount is delinquent (Code section 203D.5). The board must 19 reinstate the indemnity fees if assets in the fund are $3 20 million or less. 21 DIVISION I BACKGROUND ââ CREDIT-SALE CONTRACTS. A 22 credit-sale contract (also referred to as deferred-payment 23 contract, deferred-pricing contract, or price-later contract) 24 involves a transaction for the sale of grain in which the 25 sales price is to be paid to the seller by the licensed grain 26 dealer more than 30 days after the delivery of the grain to 27 the licensed grain dealer (Code section 203.1). The delayed 28 price arrangement may be made on the basis of an expectation 29 of higher price or deferred tax liability. For regulations 30 regarding the use of credit-sale contracts by licensees, see 31 Code sections 203.3, 203.8, 203.15, 203.17, and 203C.17. 32 DIVISION I BACKGROUND ââ PAYMENT OF CLAIMS. A claim by a 33 seller or depositor (claimant) for the reimbursement of a loss 34 from the indemnity fund begins on the incurrence date which is 35 -13- LSB 2711SV (2) 91 da/ns 13/ 17 S.F. 608 when the grain dealerâs or warehouse operatorâs state license 1 ceases or when the grain dealer or warehouse operator files 2 a petition in bankruptcy, as elected by the claimant (Code 3 section 203D.6). The claim must meet eligibility requirements, 4 meaning that it is timely filed, there is evidence of a loss 5 incurred by a claimant, and the claim derives from a covered 6 transaction. For a claimant who is a seller, a covered 7 transaction requires that title be transferred with six months 8 of the incurrence date. A covered transaction excludes sale by 9 credit-sale contract. The value of a loss incurred by a seller 10 is based on the grainâs sales price. If the sold grain was 11 unpriced, the value of a claim is presumed to be based upon the 12 price paid on the incurrence date at the nearest terminal. For 13 a claimant who is a depositor, a covered transaction requires 14 that the grain must have been delivered to a licensed warehouse 15 operator. Generally, the value of the depositorâs claim is 16 based on the grainâs fair market value. A seller or depositor 17 is entitled to be reimbursed 90 percent of a loss but not more 18 than $300,000. 19 DIVISION I PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FEES TRIGGERS. The 20 division adjusts both triggers waiving or reinstating the two 21 indemnity fees. The division increases from $8 million to $12 22 million the balance in the indemnity fund required to trigger a 23 waiver and increases from $3 million to $5 million the balance 24 in the indemnity fund required to trigger a reinstatement. 25 DIVISION I PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNIFICATION OF LOSSES 26 (REPAYMENT CLAIMS). The division allows a seller to file a 27 special repayment claim against the indemnity fund as a result 28 of the grain dealerâs bankruptcy. The special repayment 29 process allows such a seller to recover the amount of the grain 30 dealer payment that the seller was forced to repay to the 31 grain dealerâs bankruptcy estate. To be timely, a seller must 32 file a repayment claim with DALS not later than 60 days after 33 the repayment loss is finalized by a bankruptcy court. DALS 34 may provide notice of the repayment claim process to a seller 35 -14- LSB 2711SV (2) 91 da/ns 14/ 17 S.F. 608 who may file a repayment claim. If DALS chooses to provide 1 a notice to the seller, DALS has discretion to determine a 2 reasonable method and manner of providing such notice. The 3 indemnity board must determine that a repayment claim is 4 eligible for payment from the indemnity fund, including whether 5 the repayment claim derives from a covered transaction. DALS 6 is required to deliver notice to a seller filing a repayment 7 claim regarding the indemnity boardâs determination in the same 8 manner as for an ordinary loss. Like an ordinary loss, the 9 seller is entitled to receive 90 percent of a loss but not more 10 than $300,000, a deferral of payments based on insufficient 11 moneys in the indemnity fund, subrogation, and a five-year 12 expiration period. 13 DIVISION I PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FUND (FEES AND 14 REIMBURSEMENT BASED ON CREDIT-SALE CONTRACT TRANSACTIONS). 15 The division provides that grain sold by credit-sale contract 16 is considered purchased grain. Therefore, a licensed grain 17 dealer is assessed a participation fee and per-bushel fee and 18 a licensed warehouse operator is assessed a participation 19 fee. The division also provides that the sale of grain by 20 credit-sale contract is no longer excluded from the meaning 21 of a covered transaction. A seller may therefore claim a 22 loss resulting from the grain dealerâs breach of this type 23 of contract. Generally, the amount of the loss equals the 24 sales price after deducting any amount received or otherwise 25 recovered through other legal and equitable remedies including 26 the liquidation of assets (Code section 203D.1). In the case 27 of a claim filed for a loss resulting from a credit-sale 28 contract for which no price was established, the valuation 29 would be determined in the manner described for unpriced grain. 30 The division does not modify special regulations that apply to 31 a licenseeâs use of a credit-sale contract. 32 DIVISION I PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FEES (PAYMENT DATES). 33 The bill provides that a licensee may remit the participation 34 fee in one installment as part of the license renewal or four 35 -15- LSB 2711SV (2) 91 da/ns 15/ 17 S.F. 608 successive installments not later than in the month following 1 the end of the fundâs assessment quarter. The bill provides 2 that the grain dealer pays the per-bushel fee on the same 3 installment dates. 4 DIVISION I PROVISIONS ââ EMERGENCY RULES. DALS is 5 authorized to adopt rules on an emergency basis necessary 6 to administer the divisionâs provisions. When a statute 7 authorizes emergency rulemaking, an agency may adopt a rule 8 immediately without going through the periods of the rulemaking 9 process known as regulatory analysis (Code section 17A.4A) 10 and notice of intended action (Code section 17A.4(3)). The 11 division requires that such emergency rulemaking be âdouble 12 barreledâ. Under that process, when an agency files an 13 emergency rule, it also files the same rule as a notice 14 of intended action that will follow the regular rulemaking 15 process. Normally, a rule cannot be effective prior to 35 days 16 after its filing with the administrative rules coordinator 17 and publication in the Iowa administrative bulletin. Under 18 emergency rulemaking, a rule can be made effective on the 19 date of filing and acceptance by the administrative rules 20 coordinator or any subsequent date, as specified by the agency 21 in the filing (Code section 17A.5(2)(b)(1)). This provision of 22 the bill takes effect upon enactment. 23 DIVISION I PROVISIONS ââ ASSESSMENT OF FEES (CREDIT-SALE 24 CONTRACT). A grain dealer who is a party to a credit-sale 25 contract owing an indemnity fee assessed on grain purchased by 26 credit-sale contract is imposed on September 1 of the first 27 assessment quarter. 28 DIVISION I PROVISIONS ââ APPLICABILITY. The bill provides 29 that the new process for the repayment of claims applies to a 30 seller who incurs a repayment loss against a grain dealer who 31 is a debtor in bankruptcy on or after October 24, 2022. The 32 bill also provides that for a repayment loss incurred prior to 33 July 1, 2025, the claim period ends on August 29, 2025. 34 DIVISION II BACKGROUND ââ FUNDâS ASSESSMENT YEAR. Prior 35 -16- LSB 2711SV (2) 91 da/ns 16/ 17 S.F. 608 to 2023, the fundâs assessment year began on July 1 and ended 1 on June 30, which corresponded to the state fiscal year, with 2 assessment quarters beginning July 1, October 1, January 1, and 3 April 1. In 2023 Iowa Acts, chapter 154, the assessment year 4 was changed to September 1, and the assessment quarters begin 5 on September 1, December 1, March 1, and June 1. 6 DIVISION II PROVISIONS ââ FUNDâS ASSESSMENT YEAR. The 7 division restores the former assessment year and quarters. 8 However, the division takes effect on the publication date of 9 the issue of the Iowa administrative bulletin stating that the 10 current indemnity fees have been waived. 11 -17- LSB 2711SV (2) 91 da/ns 17/ 17

The department acting on behalf of the board shall 7 deliver a notice to a seller filing a claim under this section. 8 The notice must include the boardâs determination of the 9 sellerâs eligibility and the value of the sellerâs repayment 10 loss. Within twenty days of delivering the notice, the seller 11 may request a hearing for the review of either determination. 12 The request shall be made in the manner provided by the 13 board. The hearing and any further appeal shall be conducted 14 as a contested case subject to chapter 17A. A seller whose 15 repayment claim has been refused by the board may appeal the 16 refusal to either the district court of Polk county or the 17 district court of the county in which the seller resides. 18 8.

The department, upon the boardâs 28 instruction, shall hold the claims for deferred payment until 29 the board determines that the fund again contains sufficient 30 assets. 31 9. In the event of the payment of a repayment loss under 32 this section, the fund is subrogated to the extent of the 33 amount of any payments to all rights, powers, privileges, 34 and remedies of the seller against any person regarding 35 -9- LSB 2711SV (2) 91 da/ns 9/ 17 S.F. 608 the repayment loss. The seller shall render all necessary 1 assistance to the department and the board in securing the 2 rights granted in this section. No action or claim initiated 3 by a seller and pending at the time of payment from the fund 4 shall be compromised or settled without the consent of the 5 board. 6 10. a. A repayment claim shall expire if five years after 7 the board determines that the repayment claim is eligible, and 8 the claimant has failed to do any of the following: 9 (1) Provide for the fundâs subrogation or render all 10 necessary assistance to the department and the board in 11 securing the departmentâs rights of subrogation as required in 12 this section. 13 (2) Provide necessary documentation or information required 14 by the board in order to process the repayment claim. 15 b.

The department of agriculture and land stewardship shall 32 send a copy of the notice to the Code editor at least two 33 weeks prior to the publication date of the Iowa administrative 34 bulletin as described in subsection l. 35 -11- LSB 2711SV (2) 91 da/ns 11/ 17 S.F. 608 EXPLANATION 1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 2 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 3 BACKGROUND ââ GRAIN DEALERS AND WAREHOUSE OPERATORS. This 4 bill amends provisions regulating marketers of grain, referred 5 to as grain dealers purchasing grain (Code chapter 203), and 6 warehouse operators storing grain under bailment (Code chapter 7 203C), administered by the department of agriculture and land 8 stewardship (DALS). 9 DIVISION I BACKGROUND ââ GRAIN DEPOSITORS AND SELLERS 10 INDEMNITY FUND. A person selling grain to a licensed grain 11 dealer (seller) or a person depositing grain with a licensed 12 warehouse operator (depositor) may be reimbursed for a loss 13 incurred by the failure of the licensee to honor a contractual 14 obligation regarding the transaction (Code section 203D.6). A 15 payment is made from the grain depositors and sellers indemnity 16 fund (indemnity fund) upon a determination that the claim is 17 eligible for payment by the Iowa grain indemnity fund board 18 (indemnity board) acting in cooperation with DALS. 19 DIVISION I BACKGROUND ââ FEES. In addition to license fees 20 deposited into the general fund of the state (Code sections 21 203.6 and 203C.33), each licensee may be required to pay 22 either one or two special fees (indemnity fees) to support 23 the indemnity fund, referred to as a participation fee and 24 per-bushel fee. The licensed grain dealerâs participation 25 fee is calculated according to the following formula: the 26 assessment rate of not more than $0.014 multiplied by all 27 bushels of purchased grain during the grain dealerâs prior 28 fiscal year with a minimum of $50 and no maximum limit. The 29 licensed grain dealerâs per-bushel fee is calculated according 30 to a similar formula: the assessment rate of not more than 31 $0.25 multiplied by all bushels of purchased grain for the 32 grain dealerâs assessment year with no minimum and a $500 33 maximum limit. The qualifying term âpurchased grainâ equals 34 the total number of bushels purchased from sellers minus a 35 -12- LSB 2711SV (2) 91 da/ns 12/ 17 S.F. 608 number of exempt bushel purchases, including those purchased 1 under credit-sale contract (Code section 203D.1). Purchased 2 grain is reported to DALS as âpaid company-ownedâ (Code section 3 203D.1). The licensed warehouse operatorâs participation 4 fee is $0.014 multiplied by the number of bushels of storage 5 capacity of the warehouse (Code section 203D.5). 6 DIVISION I BACKGROUND ââ INDEMNITY BOARD REVIEW OF INDEMNITY 7 FUND. The indemnity board must annually review the debits 8 of and credits to the indemnity fund and by May 1 determine 9 whether the balance triggers a waiver or reinstatement (Code 10 section 203D.5). The triggered waiver or reinstatement is 11 effective on the first day of the following assessment year 12 (September 1). If a waiver is triggered on the last day of an 13 assessment year, a licensee is subject to pay the outstanding 14 amount of the participation fee that is otherwise owing for 15 the current assessment year. However, a licensed grain dealer 16 is no longer obligated to pay the outstanding amount of the 17 per-bushel fee otherwise owing for that period, unless the 18 amount is delinquent (Code section 203D.5). The board must 19 reinstate the indemnity fees if assets in the fund are $3 20 million or less. 21 DIVISION I BACKGROUND ââ CREDIT-SALE CONTRACTS. A 22 credit-sale contract (also referred to as deferred-payment 23 contract, deferred-pricing contract, or price-later contract) 24 involves a transaction for the sale of grain in which the 25 sales price is to be paid to the seller by the licensed grain 26 dealer more than 30 days after the delivery of the grain to 27 the licensed grain dealer (Code section 203.1). The delayed 28 price arrangement may be made on the basis of an expectation 29 of higher price or deferred tax liability. For regulations 30 regarding the use of credit-sale contracts by licensees, see 31 Code sections 203.3, 203.8, 203.15, 203.17, and 203C.17. 32 DIVISION I BACKGROUND ââ PAYMENT OF CLAIMS. A claim by a 33 seller or depositor (claimant) for the reimbursement of a loss 34 from the indemnity fund begins on the incurrence date which is 35 -13- LSB 2711SV (2) 91 da/ns 13/ 17 S.F. 608 when the grain dealerâs or warehouse operatorâs state license 1 ceases or when the grain dealer or warehouse operator files 2 a petition in bankruptcy, as elected by the claimant (Code 3 section 203D.6). The claim must meet eligibility requirements, 4 meaning that it is timely filed, there is evidence of a loss 5 incurred by a claimant, and the claim derives from a covered 6 transaction. For a claimant who is a seller, a covered 7 transaction requires that title be transferred with six months 8 of the incurrence date. A covered transaction excludes sale by 9 credit-sale contract. The value of a loss incurred by a seller 10 is based on the grainâs sales price. If the sold grain was 11 unpriced, the value of a claim is presumed to be based upon the 12 price paid on the incurrence date at the nearest terminal. For 13 a claimant who is a depositor, a covered transaction requires 14 that the grain must have been delivered to a licensed warehouse 15 operator. Generally, the value of the depositorâs claim is 16 based on the grainâs fair market value. A seller or depositor 17 is entitled to be reimbursed 90 percent of a loss but not more 18 than $300,000. 19 DIVISION I PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FEES TRIGGERS. The 20 division adjusts both triggers waiving or reinstating the two 21 indemnity fees. The division increases from $8 million to $12 22 million the balance in the indemnity fund required to trigger a 23 waiver and increases from $3 million to $5 million the balance 24 in the indemnity fund required to trigger a reinstatement. 25 DIVISION I PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNIFICATION OF LOSSES 26 (REPAYMENT CLAIMS). The division allows a seller to file a 27 special repayment claim against the indemnity fund as a result 28 of the grain dealerâs bankruptcy. The special repayment 29 process allows such a seller to recover the amount of the grain 30 dealer payment that the seller was forced to repay to the 31 grain dealerâs bankruptcy estate. To be timely, a seller must 32 file a repayment claim with DALS not later than 60 days after 33 the repayment loss is finalized by a bankruptcy court. DALS 34 may provide notice of the repayment claim process to a seller 35 -14- LSB 2711SV (2) 91 da/ns 14/ 17 S.F. 608 who may file a repayment claim. If DALS chooses to provide 1 a notice to the seller, DALS has discretion to determine a 2 reasonable method and manner of providing such notice. The 3 indemnity board must determine that a repayment claim is 4 eligible for payment from the indemnity fund, including whether 5 the repayment claim derives from a covered transaction. DALS 6 is required to deliver notice to a seller filing a repayment 7 claim regarding the indemnity boardâs determination in the same 8 manner as for an ordinary loss. Like an ordinary loss, the 9 seller is entitled to receive 90 percent of a loss but not more 10 than $300,000, a deferral of payments based on insufficient 11 moneys in the indemnity fund, subrogation, and a five-year 12 expiration period. 13 DIVISION I PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FUND (FEES AND 14 REIMBURSEMENT BASED ON CREDIT-SALE CONTRACT TRANSACTIONS). 15 The division provides that grain sold by credit-sale contract 16 is considered purchased grain. Therefore, a licensed grain 17 dealer is assessed a participation fee and per-bushel fee and 18 a licensed warehouse operator is assessed a participation 19 fee. The division also provides that the sale of grain by 20 credit-sale contract is no longer excluded from the meaning 21 of a covered transaction. A seller may therefore claim a 22 loss resulting from the grain dealerâs breach of this type 23 of contract. Generally, the amount of the loss equals the 24 sales price after deducting any amount received or otherwise 25 recovered through other legal and equitable remedies including 26 the liquidation of assets (Code section 203D.1). In the case 27 of a claim filed for a loss resulting from a credit-sale 28 contract for which no price was established, the valuation 29 would be determined in the manner described for unpriced grain. 30 The division does not modify special regulations that apply to 31 a licenseeâs use of a credit-sale contract. 32 DIVISION I PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FEES (PAYMENT DATES). 33 The bill provides that a licensee may remit the participation 34 fee in one installment as part of the license renewal or four 35 -15- LSB 2711SV (2) 91 da/ns 15/ 17 S.F. 608 successive installments not later than in the month following 1 the end of the fundâs assessment quarter. The bill provides 2 that the grain dealer pays the per-bushel fee on the same 3 installment dates. 4 DIVISION I PROVISIONS ââ EMERGENCY RULES. DALS is 5 authorized to adopt rules on an emergency basis necessary 6 to administer the divisionâs provisions. When a statute 7 authorizes emergency rulemaking, an agency may adopt a rule 8 immediately without going through the periods of the rulemaking 9 process known as regulatory analysis (Code section 17A.4A) 10 and notice of intended action (Code section 17A.4(3)). The 11 division requires that such emergency rulemaking be âdouble 12 barreledâ. Under that process, when an agency files an 13 emergency rule, it also files the same rule as a notice 14 of intended action that will follow the regular rulemaking 15 process. Normally, a rule cannot be effective prior to 35 days 16 after its filing with the administrative rules coordinator 17 and publication in the Iowa administrative bulletin. Under 18 emergency rulemaking, a rule can be made effective on the 19 date of filing and acceptance by the administrative rules 20 coordinator or any subsequent date, as specified by the agency 21 in the filing (Code section 17A.5(2)(b)(1)). This provision of 22 the bill takes effect upon enactment. 23 DIVISION I PROVISIONS ââ ASSESSMENT OF FEES (CREDIT-SALE 24 CONTRACT). A grain dealer who is a party to a credit-sale 25 contract owing an indemnity fee assessed on grain purchased by 26 credit-sale contract is imposed on September 1 of the first 27 assessment quarter. 28 DIVISION I PROVISIONS ââ APPLICABILITY. The bill provides 29 that the new process for the repayment of claims applies to a 30 seller who incurs a repayment loss against a grain dealer who 31 is a debtor in bankruptcy on or after October 24, 2022. The 32 bill also provides that for a repayment loss incurred prior to 33 July 1, 2025, the claim period ends on August 29, 2025. 34 DIVISION II BACKGROUND ââ FUNDâS ASSESSMENT YEAR. Prior 35 -16- LSB 2711SV (2) 91 da/ns 16/ 17 S.F. 608 to 2023, the fundâs assessment year began on July 1 and ended 1 on June 30, which corresponded to the state fiscal year, with 2 assessment quarters beginning July 1, October 1, January 1, and 3 April 1. In 2023 Iowa Acts, chapter 154, the assessment year 4 was changed to September 1, and the assessment quarters begin 5 on September 1, December 1, March 1, and June 1. 6 DIVISION II PROVISIONS ââ FUNDâS ASSESSMENT YEAR. The 7 division restores the former assessment year and quarters. 8 However, the division takes effect on the publication date of 9 the issue of the Iowa administrative bulletin stating that the 10 current indemnity fees have been waived. 11 -17- LSB 2711SV (2) 91 da/ns 17/ 17
