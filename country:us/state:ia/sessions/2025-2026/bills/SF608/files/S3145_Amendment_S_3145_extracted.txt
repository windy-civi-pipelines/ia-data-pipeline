-20- md 20/24

1 Sec. 22. NEW SECTION. 203D.6A Indemnification of repayment
2 loss against fund.
3 1. A separate process is established to provide for the
4 fund’s indemnification of a repayment claim that includes a
5 repayment loss incurred by a seller against a grain dealer,
6 if the grain dealer is a debtor in bankruptcy under the
7 protections provided in Tit. 11 of the United States Code.
8 a. A repayment claim that includes the repayment loss shall
9 be filed with the department in the manner prescribed by the
10 department.
11 b. A seller may file an eligible claim for a dollar value
12 loss under section 203D.6 and an eligible repayment claim for a
13 repayment loss under this section.
14 c. The department may reconcile a repayment claim filed
15 under this subsection with a claim filed by the same claimant
16 that is part of the same covered transaction under the claim
17 period as provided in section 203D.6.
18 2. To be timely, a seller must file a repayment claim with
19 the department not later than sixty days after the amount of
20 the seller’s loss is finalized by a bankruptcy court, whether
21 by an order issued, judgment entered, or settlement agreement
22 approved.
23 3. The department may provide notice of the repayment claim
24 process to a seller that may become or has become subject to
25 an order issued, judgment entered, or settlement agreement
26 approved by a bankruptcy court in the grain dealer’s bankruptcy
27 proceeding that requires the seller to pay back the amount
28 previously received for grain purchased by the grain dealer.
29 If the department chooses to provide a notice to the seller, it
30 shall have discretion to determine any reasonable method and
31 manner of providing such notice. A failure by the department
32 to provide a notice or a failure by a seller to receive a
33 notice under this subsection does not relieve the seller of the
34 requirement to timely file a repayment claim.
35 4. The board shall determine that a repayment claim is

3 a. The repayment claim was timely filed.
4 b. The repayment claimant qualifies as a seller.
5 c. The repayment claim derives from a covered transaction.
6 For purposes of this paragraph, a repayment claim derives
7 from a covered transaction if the claimant is a seller who
8 transferred title to the grain to a licensed grain dealer
9 within six months of the incurrence date as provided in section
10 203D.6, subsection 2.
11 d. The seller submits adequate proof to establish the
12 repayment claim and the amount of the repayment loss.
13 e. A claim has not been paid for the same loss.
14 5. A seller is not entitled to indemnify a claim for a
15 repayment loss if the repayment loss is incurred as a result of
16 a fraudulent transfer or conveyance by the seller.
17 6. The dollar value loss of a repayment claim is the amount
18 the seller has paid back to a grain dealer’s bankruptcy estate
19 that the seller previously received from the grain dealer’s
20 purchase of the grain, if paying back the amount was the result
21 of an order issued, judgment entered, or settlement agreement
22 approved by a bankruptcy court, and which has not been
23 recovered through other legal or equitable remedies including
24 the liquidation of the grain dealer’s assets.
25 7. The department acting on behalf of the board shall
26 deliver a notice to a seller filing a repayment claim
27 under this section. The notice must include the board’s
28 determination of the seller’s eligibility and the dollar
29 value of the seller’s repayment loss. Within twenty days of
30 delivering the notice, the seller may request a hearing for the
31 review of either determination. The request shall be made in
32 the manner provided by the board. The hearing and any further
33 appeal shall be conducted as a contested case subject to
34 chapter 17A. A seller whose repayment claim has been refused
35 by the board may appeal the refusal to either the district
SF 608.1879.H (1) 91
-22- md 22/24

1 court of Polk county or the district court of the county in
2 which the seller resides.
3 8. Upon a determination that the repayment claim is
4 eligible for indemnification, the board shall provide for
5 indemnification of the repayment loss, as required in section
6 203D.6. If at any time the board determines that there are
7 insufficient moneys in the fund to fully indemnify all eligible
8 claims under section 203D.6 and all eligible repayment claims
9 under this section, the board shall order that the eligible
10 claims be fully indemnified during one or more indemnification
11 periods as provided in section 203D.6.
12 9. In the event of the indemnification of a repayment loss
13 under this section, the fund is subrogated to the extent of
14 the amount of any payments to all rights, powers, privileges,
15 and remedies of the seller against any person regarding
16 the repayment loss. The seller shall render all necessary
17 assistance to the department and the board in securing the
18 rights granted in this section. An action or claim initiated
19 by a seller and pending at the time of indemnification from the
20 fund shall not be compromised or settled without the consent
21 of the board.
22 10. a. A repayment claim shall expire if five years after
23 the board determines that the repayment claim is eligible, the
24 claimant has failed to do any of the following:
25 (1) Provide for the fund’s subrogation or render all
26 necessary assistance to the department and the board in
27 securing the department’s rights of subrogation as required in
28 this section.
29 (2) Provide necessary documentation or information required
30 by the board in order to process the indemnification claim.

32 expired repayment claim.
