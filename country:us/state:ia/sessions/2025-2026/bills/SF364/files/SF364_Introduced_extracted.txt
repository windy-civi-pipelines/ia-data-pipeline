If an action was previously dismissed before 14 the effective date of the bill on the grounds that it was 15 time-barred or because the party failed to file a petition, the 16 party shall have a right to file a revival action. 17 The bill provides that the district court shall try civil 18 cases in the order in which cases are initiated by the filing 19 of a petition, but entitles cases to preference if the cases 20 have been revived pursuant to Code section 614.1(12)(b) or 21 Code section 615.8A(2) or actions in which the interests of 22 justice, as determined by the supreme court, will be served by 23 early trial.
