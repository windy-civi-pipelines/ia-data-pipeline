8 Sec. 38. EFFECTIVE DATE. This division of this Act, being
9 deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
10 EXPLANATION
11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
12 the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
13 This bill relates to matters under the purview of the
14 department of health and human services (HHS).
15 DIVISION I —— ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS. The
16 bill excludes persons employed by an administrative services
17 organization (ASO) from the definition of an employee for the
18 purposes of the Iowa public employees’ retirement system.
19 The bill prohibits an ASO, or an officer or an employee
20 of an ASO, from acting as a county’s advocate to represent
21 the interests of patients involuntarily hospitalized by the
22 court in matters relating to a patient’s hospitalization or
23 treatment.
24 DIVISION II —— CHILD FOSTER CARE. Under current law, a
25 person’s periodic support payments pursuant to an order or
26 judgment are deemed assigned to HHS if the person is or has
27 a child receiving foster care services. The assignment does
28 not apply when a child is placed with a relative or fictive
29 kin of the child who is not licensed to provide child foster
30 care. The bill permits the assignment unless the relative or
31 fictive kin is not licensed to provide child foster care and
32 not approved by HHS to provide services as specified by HHS.
33 The bill includes within the Code chapter 237 (child foster
34 care facilities) definition of “licensee”, an individual who
35 has been approved by HHS to provide child foster care.
LSB 1459XD (3) 91
-14- dg/ko 14/17
S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 The bill makes several changes to Code chapter 237 and to
2 Code sections 232.78 (temporary custody of a child pursuant to
3 ex parte court order), 232.98 (hearing concerning temporary
4 removal), 232.102 (transfer of legal custody of child and
5 placement), 234.1 (child and family services —— definitions),
6 234.39 (child and family services —— responsibility for costs
7 of services), 237A.3A (child development homes), and 423.3
8 (streamlined sales and use tax Act —— exemptions).
9 DIVISION III —— CHILD AND DEPENDENT ADULT ABUSE. The bill
10 makes child abuse information and information obtained in the
11 course of an assessment or evaluation of a report of dependent
12 adult abuse confidential records.
13 The bill allows a community-based entity to apply for and
14 receive funds appropriated to HHS by the general assembly
15 for child abuse prevention. Under current law, only a
16 community-based volunteer coalition or council can apply for
17 and receive such funds.
18 The bill defines “exploitation of a dependent adult” as a
19 fraudulent, illegal, unauthorized, or otherwise improper act or
20 process of an individual, including a caregiver or a fiduciary,
21 that results in the use of a dependent adult’s resources
22 for the financial or personal benefit, profit, or gain of a
23 person other than the dependent adult, or the deprivation of a
24 dependent adult’s rightful access to or use of the dependent
25 adult’s benefits, resources, belongings, or assets.
26 Under current law, upon a showing of probable cause that
27 a dependent adult has been financially exploited a court may
28 authorize a person, who is also authorized by HHS, to gain
29 access to the financial records of the dependent adult. The
30 bill amends the statute so the person authorized by the court
31 and HHS can gain access to financial records that HHS has a
32 reasonable belief are related to the financial resources of the
33 dependent adult.
34 The bill authorizes an instrumentality of the state to
35 access dependent adult abuse records if the instrumentality
LSB 1459XD (3) 91
-15- dg/ko 15/17
S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 is under contract with HHS to carry out official duties and
2 functions of the dependent adult abuse registry.
3 The bill requires the director of HHS to require providers
4 under the medical assistance program to share information with
5 HHS as necessary to identify, prevent, or respond to child or
6 dependent adult abuse.
7 The bill makes conforming changes to Code section 235B.6
8 (dependent adult abuse services —— authorized access).
9 DIVISION IV —— DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ——
10 CONFIDENTIALITY OF INTERNAL AUDIT AND EXAMINATION INFORMATION.
11 The bill makes information, including workpapers, created
12 or received by HHS during an internal audit or examination
13 (information) confidential. HHS may disclose the information
14 as necessary to complete an audit or examination, to comply
15 with a state or federal law, or to allow an HHS representative
16 to testify in court. The information becomes public record
17 upon completion of the internal audit or examination to which
18 the information pertains. The bill also prevents the state
19 auditor from accessing the information except as required to
20 comply with the standards for engagement described in Code
21 section 11.3 (when audits and examinations begin), to comply
22 with state or federal regulations, or in case of alleged or
23 suspected embezzlement or theft.
24 DIVISION V —— REGION INCENTIVE FUND —— DISTRIBUTIONS AND
25 TRANSFERS. The bill appropriates from the region incentive
26 fund of the mental health and disability services regional
27 service fund to HHS for FY 2024-2025, an amount as necessary to
28 ensure the continuity of care for persons transferring services
29 from the mental health and disability services system to the
30 behavioral health services system (BHSS) and establish the
31 BHSS. The moneys may be distributed to and used by an ASO for
32 expenses related to the purposes described in the bill. The
33 moneys used by an ASO do not count toward the ASO’s 7 percent
34 limit on administrative costs.
35 The bill requires any unobligated and unencumbered moneys

1 remaining in the mental health and disability services regional

10 EXPLANATION
11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
12 the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
13 This bill relates to matters under the purview of the
14 department of health and human services (HHS).
15 DIVISION I —— ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS. The
16 bill excludes persons employed by an administrative services
17 organization (ASO) from the definition of an employee for the
18 purposes of the Iowa public employees’ retirement system.
19 The bill prohibits an ASO, or an officer or an employee
20 of an ASO, from acting as a county’s advocate to represent
21 the interests of patients involuntarily hospitalized by the
22 court in matters relating to a patient’s hospitalization or
23 treatment.
24 DIVISION II —— CHILD FOSTER CARE. Under current law, a
25 person’s periodic support payments pursuant to an order or
26 judgment are deemed assigned to HHS if the person is or has
27 a child receiving foster care services. The assignment does
28 not apply when a child is placed with a relative or fictive
29 kin of the child who is not licensed to provide child foster
30 care. The bill permits the assignment unless the relative or
31 fictive kin is not licensed to provide child foster care and
32 not approved by HHS to provide services as specified by HHS.
33 The bill includes within the Code chapter 237 (child foster
34 care facilities) definition of “licensee”, an individual who
35 has been approved by HHS to provide child foster care.
LSB 1459XD (3) 91
-14- dg/ko 14/17

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 The bill makes several changes to Code chapter 237 and to
2 Code sections 232.78 (temporary custody of a child pursuant to
3 ex parte court order), 232.98 (hearing concerning temporary
4 removal), 232.102 (transfer of legal custody of child and
5 placement), 234.1 (child and family services —— definitions),
6 234.39 (child and family services —— responsibility for costs
7 of services), 237A.3A (child development homes), and 423.3
8 (streamlined sales and use tax Act —— exemptions).
9 DIVISION III —— CHILD AND DEPENDENT ADULT ABUSE. The bill
10 makes child abuse information and information obtained in the
11 course of an assessment or evaluation of a report of dependent
12 adult abuse confidential records.
13 The bill allows a community-based entity to apply for and
14 receive funds appropriated to HHS by the general assembly
15 for child abuse prevention. Under current law, only a
16 community-based volunteer coalition or council can apply for
17 and receive such funds.
18 The bill defines “exploitation of a dependent adult” as a
19 fraudulent, illegal, unauthorized, or otherwise improper act or
20 process of an individual, including a caregiver or a fiduciary,
21 that results in the use of a dependent adult’s resources
22 for the financial or personal benefit, profit, or gain of a
23 person other than the dependent adult, or the deprivation of a
24 dependent adult’s rightful access to or use of the dependent
25 adult’s benefits, resources, belongings, or assets.
26 Under current law, upon a showing of probable cause that
27 a dependent adult has been financially exploited a court may
28 authorize a person, who is also authorized by HHS, to gain
29 access to the financial records of the dependent adult. The
30 bill amends the statute so the person authorized by the court
31 and HHS can gain access to financial records that HHS has a
32 reasonable belief are related to the financial resources of the
