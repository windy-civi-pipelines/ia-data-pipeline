S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 The bill specifically authorizes the state of Iowa or a state

3 from the requirements that the applicant for a retail alcohol
4 license, class “A” native distilled spirits license, class “A”
5 or special class “A” beer permit, or class “A” wine permit be a
6 person of good moral character and authorized to do business in
7 the state of Iowa. The bill does not enact such an exclusion
8 for a wine auction permit (Code section 123.173C).
9 This division takes effect upon enactment.
10 LICENSING FEE DETERMINATION. Under current law, when
11 determining the applicable fee for a class “B”, class “C”,
12 special class “C”, or class “E” retail alcohol license, where
13 the premises or commercial establishment is located outside the
14 corporate limits of any city, the population of the nearest
15 incorporated city is used, unless the licensed premises is
16 located in an unincorporated town, then the unincorporated
17 town is treated as a city. The bill instead determines such
18 fees based on the population of the nearest incorporated city
19 as determined by the address assigned by United State postal
20 service.
21 This division applies to licenses issued or renewed on or
22 after November 10, 2025. A license issued prior to that date
23 and in effect on that date shall continue in full force and
24 effect until expiration or renewal.

31 authorizes a special class “C” retail alcohol licensee or a
32 special class “C” retail native wine licensee to sell mixed

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 The bill specifically authorizes the state of Iowa or a state
2 agency to be issued a retail alcohol license and excludes them
3 from the requirements that the applicant for a retail alcohol
4 license, class “A” native distilled spirits license, class “A”
5 or special class “A” beer permit, or class “A” wine permit be a
6 person of good moral character and authorized to do business in
7 the state of Iowa. The bill does not enact such an exclusion
8 for a wine auction permit (Code section 123.173C).
9 This division takes effect upon enactment.

11 determining the applicable fee for a class “B”, class “C”,
12 special class “C”, or class “E” retail alcohol license, where
13 the premises or commercial establishment is located outside the
14 corporate limits of any city, the population of the nearest
15 incorporated city is used, unless the licensed premises is
16 located in an unincorporated town, then the unincorporated
17 town is treated as a city. The bill instead determines such
18 fees based on the population of the nearest incorporated city
19 as determined by the address assigned by United State postal
20 service.
21 This division applies to licenses issued or renewed on or
22 after November 10, 2025. A license issued prior to that date
23 and in effect on that date shall continue in full force and
24 effect until expiration or renewal.
