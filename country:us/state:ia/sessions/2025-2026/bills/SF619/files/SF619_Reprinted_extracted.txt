If an adjusterâs license is suspended beyond the 9 adjusterâs license expiration date, whether due to an ordered 10 suspension time period or failure to apply for reinstatement 11 prior to expiration, the adjuster must apply for reissuance. 12 6. A submission of voluntary forfeiture of a license 13 shall be made in writing to the commissioner. Forfeiture of 14 a license is effective on the date of submission unless a 15 contested case proceeding is pending on the date of submission. 16 If a contested case proceeding is pending, the forfeiture 17 shall become effective upon conditions as ordered by the 18 commissioner. A forfeiture made during the pendency of a 19 contested case proceeding shall be considered a disciplinary 20 action and shall be published in the same manner as is 21 applicable to any other form of disciplinary order. 22 7. The commissioner shall not be prohibited from denying an 23 application for reinstatement or reissuance, or from bringing 24 an additional immediate action, if an adjuster has engaged in 25 an additional violation of chapter 507B or 522C, or otherwise 26 failed to meet all applicable requirements. 27 8.

An umpire may be 5 required to submit a new or renewal umpire application under 6 section 522F.10. 7 c. An application for reinstatement or reissuance shall 8 allege facts which, if established, are sufficient to enable 9 the commissioner to determine that the basis of revocation, 10 suspension, or forfeiture of the applicantâs license no longer 11 exists, and must disclose if the applicant has engaged in 12 any conduct listed as a cause for licensing action that was 13 not included in the order for suspension, revocation, or 14 forfeiture. 15 d. An application for reinstatement or reissuance shall 16 allege facts which, if established, are sufficient to enable 17 the commissioner to determine that it is in the public 18 interest for the application to be granted.

The application 5 shall be docketed in the original case in which the original 6 license was suspended, revoked, or forfeited, if the case 7 exists. 8 3. An order of reinstatement or reissuance shall be based 9 on a written decision which incorporates findings of fact 10 and conclusions of law. An order granting an application 11 for reinstatement or reissuance may impose such terms and 12 conditions as the commissioner or the commissionerâs designee 13 deems appropriate, which may include one or more penalties 14 provided under this chapter. The order shall be a public 15 record and may be disseminated in compliance with chapter 22. 16 4.

A forfeiture made during the pendency of a 1 contested case proceeding shall be considered a disciplinary 2 action and shall be published in the same manner as is 3 applicable to any other form of disciplinary order. 4 7. The commissioner shall not be prohibited from denying 5 an application for reinstatement or reissuance, or bringing 6 an additional immediate action, if an appraiser or umpire 7 has engaged in an additional violation of chapter 507B or 8 this chapter or otherwise failed to meet all applicable 9 requirements. 10 8.
