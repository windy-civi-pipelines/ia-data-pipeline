If an adjusterâs license is suspended beyond the 6 adjusterâs license expiration date, whether due to an ordered 7 suspension time period or failure to apply for reinstatement 8 prior to expiration, the adjuster must apply for reissuance. 9 6. A submission of voluntary forfeiture of a license 10 shall be made in writing to the commissioner. Forfeiture of 11 a license is effective on the date of submission unless a 12 contested case proceeding is pending on the date of submission. 13 If a contested case proceeding is pending, the forfeiture 14 shall become effective upon conditions as ordered by the 15 commissioner. A forfeiture made during the pendency of a 16 contested case proceeding shall be considered a disciplinary 17 action and shall be published in the same manner as is 18 applicable to any other form of disciplinary order. 19 7.

The program shall be a joint and cooperative undertaking 13 of the department of homeland security and emergency management 14 (HSEMD) and the Iowa finance authority (IFA). 15 The bill creates a natural hazard mitigation revolving loan 16 fund (fund) under the control of HSEMD, in consultation with 17 IFA, consisting of moneys and program funding as detailed in 18 the bill. 19 HSEMD, in consultation with IFA, may establish and maintain 20 funds or accounts necessary to carry out the purposes of the 21 bill. Any moneys appropriated to HSEMD and IFA for purposes 22 of paying the costs and expenses associated with the program 23 shall be administered as determined by IFA. The funds or 24 accounts are separate dedicated funds and accounts under the 25 administration and control of IFA, and shall not be considered 26 part of the general fund of the state, are not subject to 27 appropriation for any other purpose by the general assembly, 28 and in determining a general fund balance shall not be included 29 in the general fund of the state, but shall remain in the funds 30 and accounts maintained by HSEMD or IFA. IFA may provide for 31 the issuance of bonds or notes as detailed in the bill. 32 The duties of the director of HSEMD (director) are detailed 33 in the bill. 34 For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025, and each fiscal 35 -91- LSB 1094SZ (3) 91 nls/ko 91/ 106 S.F. 619 year thereafter, HSEMD may prepare and deliver intended use 1 plans to, and enter into capitalization grant agreements with, 2 the administrator of the United States federal emergency 3 management agency and may accept capitalization grants for the 4 fund.

IFA, in cooperation with HSEMD, shall determine 9 the interest rate and repayment terms for each loan under the 10 program and shall enter into a loan agreement with each loan 11 recipient. IFA may charge loan recipients fees and assess 12 costs as necessary. 13 Moneys in the fund shall be used for the primary purpose of 14 making loans to eligible entities to finance eligible costs of 15 projects in accordance with the intended use plans. The loan 16 recipients and the purpose and amount of the loans shall be 17 determined by the director. 18 HSEMD, in consultation with IFA, shall adopt rules pursuant 19 to Code chapter 17A to administer the division of the bill. 20 The bill makes a conforming change to Code section 422.7. 21 DIVISION II ââ DISASTER RECOVERY HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. 22 The bill requires a state of disaster emergency proclamation 23 by the governor that authorizes disaster recovery housing 24 assistance to specify if disaster recovery housing assistance 25 is available to homeowners, renters, or both homeowners and 26 renters. 27 The bill defines âfinancial assistanceâ as assistance 28 provided only from the funds, rights, and assets legally 29 available to IFA and includes but is not limited to assistance 30 in the form of grants, loans, and forgivable loans. 31 Under the bill, IFA shall not use more than 5 percent of the 32 moneys deposited into the disaster recovery housing assistance 33 fund for administrative and program costs. 34 Under current law, to be considered for financial assistance 35 -92- LSB 1094SZ (3) 91 nls/ko 92/ 106 S.F. 619 under the disaster recovery housing assistance program, 1 a homeowner or renter must register for the disaster case 2 advocacy program.

Under the bill, a violation of Code 21 section 515.137 is an unfair method of competition and unfair 22 or deceptive act or practice in the business of insurance. 23 The bill defines âpost-loss assignmentâ (assignment). The 24 assignment must only assign the insurance proceeds a named 25 insured is entitled to receive from the named insuredâs insurer 26 for the repair, replacement construction, or reconstruction of 27 the named insuredâs property. 28 A residential contractor (contractor) shall not engage 29 in conduct prohibited by the bill under an assignment by a 30 named insured to the contractor under a property and casualty 31 insurance policy. 32 An assignment must include an itemized description 33 containing the information detailed in the bill. 34 An assignment shall not impair the interest of a mortgagee, 35 -93- LSB 1094SZ (3) 91 nls/ko 93/ 106 S.F. 619 and all mortgagees shall be named as a co-payee for the payment 1 of benefits.

The 30 bond shall be executed and issued by an insurer authorized 31 to issue bonds, and must meet the requirements of the 32 bill. The division may request that an adjuster provide 33 evidence of responsibility at any time. An adjuster shall 34 immediately notify the division if the adjusterâs evidence 35 -95- LSB 1094SZ (3) 91 nls/ko 95/ 106 S.F. 619 of responsibility terminates or becomes impaired, and the 1 adjusterâs license shall become inactive. 2 An individual applying for a license shall pass a written 3 examination, unless exempt, as described in the bill. An 4 individual who concurrently applies for an adjuster license and 5 an appraiser license may choose to take a joint examination as 6 detailed in the bill. An individual who successfully passes a 7 joint examination and meets the licensure requirements shall be 8 licensed as both an adjuster and an appraiser. 9 A public adjuster shall not provide services to an insured 10 until a written contract with the insured has been executed. 11 The contract must meet all of the requirements detailed in the 12 bill. No provisions in the contract shall be redacted in a 13 copy of the contract submitted to the commissioner. 14 If the insurer, no later than five calendar days after the 15 date on which the insuredâs loss is reported, either pays 16 or commits in writing to pay the policy limits, the public 17 adjuster shall inform the insured that the total amount of 18 loss claimed by the insured may not be paid by the insured, 19 and the adjuster is only entitled to reasonable compensation 20 from the insured. Prior to execution of a contract, the public 21 adjuster shall review the terms of the contract with the 22 insured and provide a separate disclosure document that meets 23 the requirements detailed in the bill. 24 An original copy of a completed contract shall be provided 25 to the public adjuster and kept by the insured.

Within 72 hours of entering a contract with 28 an insured, the public adjuster shall provide the insuredâs 29 insurer a notification letter. A contract between a public 30 adjuster and an insured executed in violation of the bill shall 31 not be enforceable. 32 The required standards of conduct for, and duties of, an 33 adjuster are detailed in the bill. An adjuster who fails 34 to comply with the standards and duties shall be subject to 35 -96- LSB 1094SZ (3) 91 nls/ko 96/ 106 S.F. 619 penalties. 1 The division may place on probation, suspend, revoke, or 2 refuse to issue or renew an adjusterâs license, and may levy 3 a civil penalty for any of the reasons enumerated in the 4 bill. If the commissioner does not renew a license or denies 5 an application for a license, the commissioner shall notify 6 the adjuster or applicant and advise of the reason for the 7 nonrenewal or denial. The adjuster or applicant may request a 8 hearing within 30 days from the date of the notice. 9 The commissioner may conduct an investigation of any 10 suspected violation of the bill and may impose a penalty or 11 remedy against any person who is under investigation for, or 12 charged with, a violation even if the personâs license has been 13 surrendered or has lapsed by operation of law. 14 All complaint files, investigation files, other 15 investigation reports, and other investigative information in 16 the possession of the commissioner that relates to adjuster 17 discipline are privileged and confidential, and may only be 18 disclosed as described in the bill. On appeal by the adjuster, 19 the commissioner shall transmit the entire record of the 20 contested case to the reviewing court. 21 Upon a determination by the commissioner, after a hearing, 22 that an adjuster has violated a provision of the bill, 23 the commissioner shall reduce the findings of the hearing 24 to writing and deliver a copy to the adjuster. Upon a 25 determination by the commissioner that an adjuster has engaged 26 in any act or practice constituting a violation of the bill, 27 the commissioner may take any of the civil actions described 28 in the bill. 29 A person acting as an adjuster without proper licensure, 30 or an adjuster who willfully violates any provision of, or 31 order issued under, Code chapter 522C is guilty of a class 32 âDâ felony. When the violation results in a loss of more 33 than $10,000, the person or adjuster is guilty of a class âCâ 34 felony. 35 -97- LSB 1094SZ (3) 91 nls/ko 97/ 106 S.F. 619 An adjuster who steals, converts, or misappropriates funds 1 that should be held in trust in a fiduciary capacity is guilty 2 of a class âDâ felony. When the violation results in a loss 3 of more than $10,000, the adjuster is guilty of a class âCâ 4 felony. 5 A class âDâ felony is punishable by confinement for no more 6 than five years and a fine of at least $1,025 but not more than 7 $10,245. A class âCâ felony is punishable by confinement for 8 no more than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,370 but not more 9 than $13,660. 10 The commissioner may refer evidence concerning violations of 11 the bill to the attorney general or the county attorney who may 12 institute criminal proceedings. 13 Any contract that is entered into by an insured with a person 14 who is not a licensed public adjuster shall be void, and the 15 insured is not liable for the payment of any past or future 16 services by the person under that contract or otherwise. 17 An adjuster whose license has been revoked or suspended, 18 or who forfeited a license, may apply to the commissioner for 19 reinstatement or reissuance and submit to a criminal history 20 check. An applicant shall not be eligible for reinstatement 21 or reissuance until the applicant satisfies the requirements 22 detailed in the bill. 23 An application for reinstatement or reissuance shall allege 24 facts as required by the bill, and the burden of proof is on 25 the adjuster to establish such facts. An adjuster may request 26 reinstatement of a suspended license prior to the end of the 27 suspension term. If an order of revocation or suspension did 28 not establish terms on which reinstatement or reissuance may 29 occur, or if the license was forfeited, an initial application 30 for reinstatement or reissuance shall not be made until at 31 least one year from the date of the order. All proceedings on 32 the application for reinstatement or reissuance shall be held 33 in accordance with Code chapter 17A. 34 If an adjusterâs ordered suspension period ends prior to 35 -98- LSB 1094SZ (3) 91 nls/ko 98/ 106 S.F. 619 the adjusterâs license expiration date, and the adjuster 1 applies for reinstatement and meets all requirements, the 2 division shall reinstate the license as soon as practicable 3 but no earlier than the end of the suspension period.

Any moneys appropriated to HSEMD and IFA for purposes 22 of paying the costs and expenses associated with the program 23 shall be administered as determined by IFA. The funds or 24 accounts are separate dedicated funds and accounts under the 25 administration and control of IFA, and shall not be considered 26 part of the general fund of the state, are not subject to 27 appropriation for any other purpose by the general assembly, 28 and in determining a general fund balance shall not be included 29 in the general fund of the state, but shall remain in the funds 30 and accounts maintained by HSEMD or IFA. IFA may provide for 31 the issuance of bonds or notes as detailed in the bill. 32 The duties of the director of HSEMD (director) are detailed 33 in the bill. 34 For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025, and each fiscal 35 -91- LSB 1094SZ (3) 91 nls/ko 91/ 106 S.F. 619 year thereafter, HSEMD may prepare and deliver intended use 1 plans to, and enter into capitalization grant agreements with, 2 the administrator of the United States federal emergency 3 management agency and may accept capitalization grants for the 4 fund.

The 30 bond shall be executed and issued by an insurer authorized 31 to issue bonds, and must meet the requirements of the 32 bill. The division may request that an adjuster provide 33 evidence of responsibility at any time. An adjuster shall 34 immediately notify the division if the adjusterâs evidence 35 -95- LSB 1094SZ (3) 91 nls/ko 95/ 106 S.F. 619 of responsibility terminates or becomes impaired, and the 1 adjusterâs license shall become inactive. 2 An individual applying for a license shall pass a written 3 examination, unless exempt, as described in the bill. An 4 individual who concurrently applies for an adjuster license and 5 an appraiser license may choose to take a joint examination as 6 detailed in the bill. An individual who successfully passes a 7 joint examination and meets the licensure requirements shall be 8 licensed as both an adjuster and an appraiser. 9 A public adjuster shall not provide services to an insured 10 until a written contract with the insured has been executed. 11 The contract must meet all of the requirements detailed in the 12 bill. No provisions in the contract shall be redacted in a 13 copy of the contract submitted to the commissioner. 14 If the insurer, no later than five calendar days after the 15 date on which the insuredâs loss is reported, either pays 16 or commits in writing to pay the policy limits, the public 17 adjuster shall inform the insured that the total amount of 18 loss claimed by the insured may not be paid by the insured, 19 and the adjuster is only entitled to reasonable compensation 20 from the insured. Prior to execution of a contract, the public 21 adjuster shall review the terms of the contract with the 22 insured and provide a separate disclosure document that meets 23 the requirements detailed in the bill. 24 An original copy of a completed contract shall be provided 25 to the public adjuster and kept by the insured.

Within 72 hours of entering a contract with 28 an insured, the public adjuster shall provide the insuredâs 29 insurer a notification letter. A contract between a public 30 adjuster and an insured executed in violation of the bill shall 31 not be enforceable. 32 The required standards of conduct for, and duties of, an 33 adjuster are detailed in the bill. An adjuster who fails 34 to comply with the standards and duties shall be subject to 35 -96- LSB 1094SZ (3) 91 nls/ko 96/ 106 S.F. 619 penalties. 1 The division may place on probation, suspend, revoke, or 2 refuse to issue or renew an adjusterâs license, and may levy 3 a civil penalty for any of the reasons enumerated in the 4 bill. If the commissioner does not renew a license or denies 5 an application for a license, the commissioner shall notify 6 the adjuster or applicant and advise of the reason for the 7 nonrenewal or denial. The adjuster or applicant may request a 8 hearing within 30 days from the date of the notice. 9 The commissioner may conduct an investigation of any 10 suspected violation of the bill and may impose a penalty or 11 remedy against any person who is under investigation for, or 12 charged with, a violation even if the personâs license has been 13 surrendered or has lapsed by operation of law. 14 All complaint files, investigation files, other 15 investigation reports, and other investigative information in 16 the possession of the commissioner that relates to adjuster 17 discipline are privileged and confidential, and may only be 18 disclosed as described in the bill. On appeal by the adjuster, 19 the commissioner shall transmit the entire record of the 20 contested case to the reviewing court. 21 Upon a determination by the commissioner, after a hearing, 22 that an adjuster has violated a provision of the bill, 23 the commissioner shall reduce the findings of the hearing 24 to writing and deliver a copy to the adjuster. Upon a 25 determination by the commissioner that an adjuster has engaged 26 in any act or practice constituting a violation of the bill, 27 the commissioner may take any of the civil actions described 28 in the bill. 29 A person acting as an adjuster without proper licensure, 30 or an adjuster who willfully violates any provision of, or 31 order issued under, Code chapter 522C is guilty of a class 32 âDâ felony. When the violation results in a loss of more 33 than $10,000, the person or adjuster is guilty of a class âCâ 34 felony. 35 -97- LSB 1094SZ (3) 91 nls/ko 97/ 106 S.F. 619 An adjuster who steals, converts, or misappropriates funds 1 that should be held in trust in a fiduciary capacity is guilty 2 of a class âDâ felony. When the violation results in a loss 3 of more than $10,000, the adjuster is guilty of a class âCâ 4 felony. 5 A class âDâ felony is punishable by confinement for no more 6 than five years and a fine of at least $1,025 but not more than 7 $10,245. A class âCâ felony is punishable by confinement for 8 no more than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,370 but not more 9 than $13,660. 10 The commissioner may refer evidence concerning violations of 11 the bill to the attorney general or the county attorney who may 12 institute criminal proceedings. 13 Any contract that is entered into by an insured with a person 14 who is not a licensed public adjuster shall be void, and the 15 insured is not liable for the payment of any past or future 16 services by the person under that contract or otherwise. 17 An adjuster whose license has been revoked or suspended, 18 or who forfeited a license, may apply to the commissioner for 19 reinstatement or reissuance and submit to a criminal history 20 check. An applicant shall not be eligible for reinstatement 21 or reissuance until the applicant satisfies the requirements 22 detailed in the bill. 23 An application for reinstatement or reissuance shall allege 24 facts as required by the bill, and the burden of proof is on 25 the adjuster to establish such facts. An adjuster may request 26 reinstatement of a suspended license prior to the end of the 27 suspension term. If an order of revocation or suspension did 28 not establish terms on which reinstatement or reissuance may 29 occur, or if the license was forfeited, an initial application 30 for reinstatement or reissuance shall not be made until at 31 least one year from the date of the order.
