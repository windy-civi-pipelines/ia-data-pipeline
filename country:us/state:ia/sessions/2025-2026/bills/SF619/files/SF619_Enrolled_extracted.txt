An application for reinstatement or reissuance shall allege facts which, if established, are sufficient to enable the commissioner to determine that it is in the public interest for the application to be granted.

If an appraiserâs or umpireâs license is suspended beyond the appraiserâs or umpireâs license expiration date, whether due to an ordered suspension time period or failure to apply for reinstatement prior to expiration, the appraiser or umpire must apply for reissuance. 6. A submission of voluntary forfeiture of a license shall be made in writing to the commissioner. Forfeiture of a license is effective upon the date of submission unless a contested case proceeding is pending on the date of submission. If a contested case proceeding is pending, the forfeiture shall become effective upon conditions as required by order of the commissioner. A forfeiture made during the pendency of a contested case proceeding shall be considered a disciplinary Senate File 619, p. 77 action and shall be published in the same manner as is applicable to any other form of disciplinary order. 7.

If the commissioner does not receive a withdrawal of the certificate of noncompliance from the issuing agency, or a notice from a clerk of court, the issuing agency, the appraiser, the umpire, or the applicant that an application for hearing has been filed within thirty calendar days after the notice is issued, the commissioner shall deny the applicantâs, appraiserâs, or umpireâs application for license issuance, renewal, reinstatement, or reissuance; suspend a current license; or revoke a currently suspended license.
