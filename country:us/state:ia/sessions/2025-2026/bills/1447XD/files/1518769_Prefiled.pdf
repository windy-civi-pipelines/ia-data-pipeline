5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
6 the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
7 This bill relates to illegal gaming. Under current law, a
8 person is prohibited from engaging in the acts outlined in Code
9 section 725.7(1). A person who violates these prohibitions is
10 guilty of illegal gaming and is subject to criminal penalties.
11 The bill defines “account sharing” and “proxy betting” and
12 includes those activities in the list of activities considered
13 illegal gaming. The bill also includes in the activities
14 considered illegal gaming the act of delivering anything of
15 value to place as a wager in a pari-mutuel pool or other
16 authorized system of wagering after receiving that thing of
17 value, for a fee, outside of a gambling structure.
18 A person guilty of illegal gaming commits an offense ranging
19 from a serious misdemeanor to a class “C” felony based on the
20 sum of money or value of other property involved and whether
21 the offense was a first or repeat offense. Illegal gaming
22 in the fourth degree ($100 or less) constitutes a serious
23 misdemeanor for a first offense, an aggravated misdemeanor
24 for a second offense, a class “D” felony for a third offense,
25 and a class “C” felony for a fourth or subsequent offense.
26 Illegal gaming in the third degree ($100 to $500) constitutes
27 an aggravated misdemeanor for a first offense, a class “D”
28 felony for a second offense, and a class “C” felony for a third
29 or subsequent offense. Illegal gaming in the second degree
30 ($500 to $5,000) constitutes a class “D” felony for a first
31 offense and a class “C” felony for a second or subsequent
32 offense. Illegal gaming in the first degree (more than $5,000)
33 constitutes a class “C” felony.
