Significant investigative information pertaining to a 25 licensee in any member state will only be available to other 26 member states. 27 f. It is the responsibility of the member states to report 28 any adverse action against a licensee and to monitor the 29 database to determine whether adverse action has been taken 30 against a licensee.

Member states contributing information to the data 34 system may designate information that may not be shared with 35 -19- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 19/ 30 H.F. 547 the public without the express permission of the contributing 1 state. 2 h. Any information submitted to the data system that is 3 subsequently expunged pursuant to federal law or the laws of 4 the member state contributing the information shall be removed 5 from the data system. 6 9. Rulemaking. 7 a. The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in 8 order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer 9 the purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule shall 10 be invalid and have no force and effect only if a court of 11 competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because 12 the commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner 13 that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or the 14 powers granted under this subsection, or based upon another 15 applicable standard of review. 16 b. For purposes of the compact, the rules of the commission 17 shall have the force of law in each member state. 18 c. The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers 19 pursuant to the criteria set forth in this subsection and the 20 rules adopted pursuant to this subsection. Rules shall become 21 binding as of the date specified in each rule. 22 d. If a majority of the legislatures of the member states 23 rejects a rule or portion of a rule, by enactment of a statute 24 or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, 25 within four years of the date of application of the rule, then 26 such rule shall have no further force and effect in any member 27 state. 28 e. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting 29 of the commission. 30 f. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission 31 shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral 32 and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments. 33 g. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the commission, 34 and at least thirty days in advance of the meeting at which the 35 -20- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 20/ 30 H.F. 547 commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed rule, the 1 commission shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking by all 2 of the following methods: 3 (1) On the internet site of the commission or other publicly 4 accessible platform. 5 (2) To persons who have requested notice of the commissionâs 6 notices of proposed rulemaking. 7 (3) In such other way as the commission may by rule specify. 8 h.

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as 29 requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be 30 grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings 31 required by this subsection. 32 k. The commission shall, by majority vote of all 33 commissioners, take final action on the proposed rule based on 34 the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule. 35 -21- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 21/ 30 H.F. 547 (1) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule, 1 provided that the changes are consistent with the original 2 purpose of the proposed rule. 3 (2) The commission shall provide an explanation of the 4 reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed rule as 5 well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were 6 recommended by commenters. 7 (3) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective 8 date for the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in 9 paragraph âlâ , the effective date of the rule shall be no sooner 10 than thirty days after issuing the notice that it adopted or 11 amended the rule. 12 l. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the 13 commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule with 14 twenty-four hoursâ notice, and with opportunity to comment, 15 provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the 16 compact and in this subsection shall be retroactively applied 17 to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later 18 than ninety days after the effective date of the rule. For the 19 purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must 20 be adopted immediately in order to do one of the following: 21 (1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or 22 welfare. 23 (2) Prevent a loss of commission or member state funds. 24 (3) Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is 25 established by federal law or rule. 26 (4) Protect public health and safety. 27 m.

Public 31 notice of any revisions shall be posted on the internet site 32 of the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge 33 by any person for a period of thirty days after posting. The 34 revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision 35 -22- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 22/ 30 H.F. 547 results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall 1 be made in writing and delivered to the commission prior to 2 the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the 3 revision will take effect without further action. If the 4 revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect 5 without the approval of the commission. 6 n. No member stateâs rulemaking process or procedural 7 requirements shall apply to the commission. The commission 8 shall have no authority over any member stateâs rulemaking 9 process or procedural requirements that do not pertain to the 10 compact. 11 o. Nothing in this compact, nor any rule or regulation 12 of the commission, shall be construed to limit, restrict, 13 or in any way reduce the ability of a member state to enact 14 and enforce laws, regulations, or other rules related to the 15 practice of respiratory therapy in that state where those laws, 16 regulations, or other rules are not inconsistent with the 17 provisions of this compact. 18 10. Oversight, dispute resolution, and enforcement. 19 a. Oversight. 20 (1) The executive and judicial branches of state government 21 in each member state shall enforce this compact and take all 22 actions necessary and appropriate to implement the compact. 23 (2) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against 24 the commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a 25 court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office 26 of the commission is located. The commission may waive 27 venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or 28 consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution 29 proceedings. Nothing in this subparagraph shall affect or 30 limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against 31 a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any 32 such similar matter. 33 (3) The commission shall be entitled to receive service 34 of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or 35 -23- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 23/ 30 H.F. 547 interpretation of the compact and shall have standing to 1 intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure 2 to provide the commission service of process shall render a 3 judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or 4 promulgated rules. 5 b. Default, technical assistance, and termination. 6 (1) If the commission determines that a member state 7 has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or 8 responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, 9 the commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting 10 state. The notice of default shall describe the default, the 11 proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that 12 the commission may take, and shall offer training and specific 13 technical assistance regarding the default. 14 (2) The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of 15 default to the other member states. 16 c. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the 17 defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon 18 an affirmative vote of a majority of the commissioners of 19 the member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits 20 conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on 21 the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does 22 not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities 23 incurred during the period of default. 24 d. Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed 25 only after all other means of securing compliance have been 26 exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall 27 be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and 28 minority leaders of the defaulting stateâs legislature, the 29 defaulting stateâs respiratory therapy licensing authority, 30 and each of the member statesâ respiratory therapy licensing 31 authorities. 32 e. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all 33 assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through 34 the effective date of termination, including obligations that 35 -24- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 24/ 30 H.F. 547 extend beyond the effective date of termination, if necessary. 1 f. Upon termination of a stateâs membership from this 2 compact, that state shall immediately provide notice to all 3 licensees and compact privilege holders of which the commission 4 has a record within that state of such termination. The 5 terminated state shall continue to recognize all licenses 6 granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of one hundred 7 eighty days after the date of said notice of termination. 8 g. The commission shall not bear any costs related to 9 a state that is found to be in default or that has been 10 terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing 11 between the commission and the defaulting state. 12 h. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the 13 commission by petitioning the United States district court 14 for the District of Columbia or the federal district where 15 the commission has its principal offices. The prevailing 16 party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including 17 reasonable attorney fees. 18 i. Dispute resolution. 19 (1) Upon request by a member state, the commission shall 20 attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise 21 among member states and between member and nonmember states. 22 (2) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for 23 both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as 24 appropriate. 25 j. Enforcement. 26 (1) By majority vote, as may be further provided by rule, 27 the commission may initiate legal action against a member state 28 in default in the United States district court for the District 29 of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has 30 its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions 31 of the compact and its promulgated rules. A member state by 32 enactment of this compact consents to venue and jurisdiction 33 in such court for the purposes set forth in this subparagraph. 34 The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and 35 -25- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 25/ 30 H.F. 547 damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, 1 the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such 2 litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. The remedies 3 in this subparagraph shall not be the exclusive remedies of the 4 commission. The commission may pursue other remedies available 5 under federal or the defaulting member stateâs law. 6 (2) A member state may initiate legal action against the 7 commission in the United States district court for the District 8 of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has 9 its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions 10 of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought 11 may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event 12 judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall 13 be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable 14 attorney fees. 15 (3) No person other than a member state shall enforce this 16 compact against the commission. 17 11. Effective date, withdrawal, and amendment. 18 a. The compact shall come into effect on the date on which 19 the compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh member 20 state. 21 (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the 22 commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of 23 the first seven member states to determine if the statute 24 enacted by each such charter member state is materially 25 different than the model compact. 26 (a) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be 27 materially different from the model compact shall be entitled 28 to the default process set forth in subsection 10. 29 (b) If any member state is later found to be in default or 30 is terminated or withdraws from the compact, the commission 31 shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in 32 effect even if the number of member states should be less than 33 seven. 34 (2) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the 35 -26- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 26/ 30 H.F. 547 seven initial charter member states shall be subject to the 1 process set forth herein and commission rule to determine 2 if their enactments are materially different from the model 3 compact and whether they qualify for participation in the 4 compact. 5 (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission 6 or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of 7 the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the 8 commission coming into existence shall be considered to be the 9 actions of the commission unless specifically repudiated by the 10 commission. The commission shall own and have all rights to 11 any intellectual property developed on behalf or in furtherance 12 of the commission by individuals or entities involved in 13 organizing or establishing the commission, as may be further 14 set forth in rules of the commission. 15 (4) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the 16 commissionâs initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be 17 subject to the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on 18 which the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has 19 been previously adopted by the commission shall have the full 20 force and effect of law on the date the compact becomes law in 21 that state. 22 b. Any member state may withdraw from this compact by 23 enacting a statute repealing the same. 24 (1) A member stateâs withdrawal shall not take effect 25 until one hundred eighty days after enactment of the repealing 26 statute. 27 (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirements 28 of the withdrawing stateâs respiratory therapy licensing 29 authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action 30 reporting requirements of this compact prior to the effective 31 date of withdrawal. 32 (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this 33 compact, a state shall immediately provide notice of such 34 withdrawal to all licensees and compact privilege holders 35 -27- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 27/ 30 H.F. 547 of which the commission has a record within that state. 1 Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the 2 contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize 3 all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum 4 of one hundred eighty days after the date of such notice of 5 withdrawal. 6 c. Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed 7 to invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other 8 cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember 9 state that does not conflict with the provisions of this 10 compact. 11 d. This compact may be amended by the member states. No 12 amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding 13 upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all 14 member states. 15 12. Construction and severability. 16 a. This compact and the commissionâs rulemaking authority 17 shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes 18 and the implementation and administration of the compact. 19 Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring 20 the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit the 21 commissionâs rulemaking authority solely for those purposes. 22 b. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and 23 if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact 24 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary 25 to the constitution of any member state, a state seeking 26 participation in the compact, or of the United States, or 27 the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, 28 or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of 29 competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this 30 compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, 31 agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. 32 c. Notwithstanding paragraph âbâ , the commission may deny 33 a stateâs participation in the compact or, in accordance 34 with the requirements of subsection 10, terminate a member 35 -28- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 28/ 30 H.F. 547 stateâs participation in the compact if it determines that a 1 constitutional requirement of a member state is a material 2 departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall 3 be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, 4 the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the 5 remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the 6 member state affected as to all severable matters. 7 13. Consistent effect and conflict with other state laws. 8 a. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent or inhibit the 9 enforcement of any other law of a member state that is not 10 inconsistent with the compact. 11 b. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal 12 requirements in a member state in conflict with the compact 13 are superseded to the extent of the conflict, including any 14 subsequently enacted state laws. 15 c. All permissible agreements between the commission and the 16 member states are binding in accordance with their terms. 17 d. Other than as expressly set forth herein, nothing in this 18 compact impacts initial licensure. 19 EXPLANATION 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 21 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 22 This bill establishes the respiratory care interstate 23 compact. 24 The compact establishes a system whereby a respiratory 25 therapist licensed to practice in one participating state 26 may practice in another participating state under a compact 27 privilege without applying for a license in that state. The 28 compact imposes certain minimum requirements on the licensure 29 of respiratory therapists in participating states. 30 The compact creates a commission to administer the operation 31 of the compact. The commission is an instrumentality of the 32 participating states. The compact includes provisions relating 33 to the establishment and membership of the commission; powers 34 of the commission; meetings and voting requirements of the 35 -29- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 29/ 30 H.F. 547 commission; commission bylaws and rules; commission committees; 1 commission finances; the establishment of a data system; 2 compacting state compliance; venue for judicial proceedings; 3 defense and indemnification; effective dates and amendments to 4 the compact; withdrawal, default, and expulsion; severability 5 and construction; and the binding effect of the compact and 6 other laws. 7 The compact becomes effective upon the adoption of the 8 compact by the seventh participating state. 9 -30- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 30/ 30

The procurement 23 of insurance of any type by the commission shall not in any way 24 compromise or limit the immunity granted in this subparagraph. 25 (3) The commission shall defend any commissioner, officer, 26 executive director, employee, or agent of the commission 27 in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising 28 out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that 29 occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, 30 or responsibilities, or as determined by the commission that 31 the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable 32 basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission 33 employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that nothing 34 in this subparagraph shall be construed to prohibit that 35 -17- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 17/ 30 H.F. 547 person from retaining counsel at that personâs own expense, 1 and provided further that the actual or alleged act, error, 2 or omission did not result from that personâs intentional or 3 willful or wanton misconduct. 4 (4) The commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any 5 commissioner, member, officer, executive director, employee, 6 and agent of the commission for the amount of any settlement or 7 judgment obtained against that person arising out of any actual 8 or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the 9 scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, 10 or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing 11 occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, 12 or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, 13 error, or omission did not result from the intentional or 14 willful or wanton misconduct of that person. 15 (5) Nothing in this compact shall be interpreted to waive 16 or otherwise abrogate a member stateâs state action immunity 17 or state action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust 18 claims under the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, or any other state 19 or federal antitrust or anticompetitive law or regulation. 20 (6) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to be a 21 waiver of sovereign immunity by the member states or by the 22 commission. 23 8. Data system. 24 a. The commission shall provide for the development, 25 maintenance, operation, and utilization of a coordinated 26 database and reporting system containing licensure, adverse 27 action, and the presence of significant investigative 28 information. 29 b. Notwithstanding any other provision of state law to the 30 contrary, a member state shall submit a uniform data set to 31 the data system as required by the rules of the commission, 32 including but not limited to all of the following: 33 (1) Identifying information. 34 (2) Licensure data. 35 -18- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 18/ 30 H.F. 547 (3) Adverse actions against a licensee, license applicant, 1 or compact privilege holder and information related thereto. 2 (4) Nonconfidential information related to alternative 3 program participation, the beginning and ending dates of 4 such participation, and other information related to such 5 participation not made confidential under member state law. 6 (5) Any denial of application for licensure, and the reason 7 for such denial. 8 (6) The presence of current significant investigative 9 information. 10 (7) Other information that may facilitate the 11 administration of this compact or the protection of the public, 12 as determined by the rules of the commission. 13 c.

The records and information provided to a member 18 state pursuant to this compact or through the data system, 19 when certified by the commission or an agent thereof, 20 shall constitute the authenticated business records of the 21 commission, and shall be entitled to any associated hearsay 22 exception in any relevant judicial, quasi-judicial, or 23 administrative proceedings in a member state. 24 e. Significant investigative information pertaining to a 25 licensee in any member state will only be available to other 26 member states. 27 f. It is the responsibility of the member states to report 28 any adverse action against a licensee and to monitor the 29 database to determine whether adverse action has been taken 30 against a licensee. Adverse action information pertaining to 31 a licensee in any member state will be available to any other 32 member state. 33 g. Member states contributing information to the data 34 system may designate information that may not be shared with 35 -19- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 19/ 30 H.F. 547 the public without the express permission of the contributing 1 state. 2 h. Any information submitted to the data system that is 3 subsequently expunged pursuant to federal law or the laws of 4 the member state contributing the information shall be removed 5 from the data system. 6 9. Rulemaking. 7 a. The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in 8 order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer 9 the purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule shall 10 be invalid and have no force and effect only if a court of 11 competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because 12 the commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner 13 that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or the 14 powers granted under this subsection, or based upon another 15 applicable standard of review. 16 b. For purposes of the compact, the rules of the commission 17 shall have the force of law in each member state. 18 c. The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers 19 pursuant to the criteria set forth in this subsection and the 20 rules adopted pursuant to this subsection. Rules shall become 21 binding as of the date specified in each rule. 22 d. If a majority of the legislatures of the member states 23 rejects a rule or portion of a rule, by enactment of a statute 24 or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, 25 within four years of the date of application of the rule, then 26 such rule shall have no further force and effect in any member 27 state. 28 e. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting 29 of the commission. 30 f. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission 31 shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral 32 and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments. 33 g. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the commission, 34 and at least thirty days in advance of the meeting at which the 35 -20- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 20/ 30 H.F. 547 commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed rule, the 1 commission shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking by all 2 of the following methods: 3 (1) On the internet site of the commission or other publicly 4 accessible platform. 5 (2) To persons who have requested notice of the commissionâs 6 notices of proposed rulemaking. 7 (3) In such other way as the commission may by rule specify. 8 h. The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include all of 9 the following: 10 (1) The time, date, and location of the public hearing at 11 which the commission will hear public comments on the proposed 12 rule and, if different, the time, date, and location of the 13 meeting where the commission will consider and vote on the 14 proposed rule. 15 (2) If the hearing is held via telecommunication, 16 videoconference, or other electronic means, the commission 17 shall include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the 18 notice of proposed rulemaking. 19 (3) The text of the proposed rule and the reason therefor. 20 (4) A request for comments on the proposed rule from any 21 interested person. 22 (5) The manner in which interested persons may submit 23 written comments. 24 i. All hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the recording 25 and all written comments and documents received by the 26 commission in response to the proposed rule shall be available 27 to the public. 28 j. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as 29 requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be 30 grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings 31 required by this subsection. 32 k. The commission shall, by majority vote of all 33 commissioners, take final action on the proposed rule based on 34 the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule. 35 -21- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 21/ 30 H.F. 547 (1) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule, 1 provided that the changes are consistent with the original 2 purpose of the proposed rule. 3 (2) The commission shall provide an explanation of the 4 reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed rule as 5 well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were 6 recommended by commenters. 7 (3) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective 8 date for the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in 9 paragraph âlâ , the effective date of the rule shall be no sooner 10 than thirty days after issuing the notice that it adopted or 11 amended the rule. 12 l. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the 13 commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule with 14 twenty-four hoursâ notice, and with opportunity to comment, 15 provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the 16 compact and in this subsection shall be retroactively applied 17 to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later 18 than ninety days after the effective date of the rule. For the 19 purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must 20 be adopted immediately in order to do one of the following: 21 (1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or 22 welfare. 23 (2) Prevent a loss of commission or member state funds. 24 (3) Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is 25 established by federal law or rule. 26 (4) Protect public health and safety. 27 m. The commission or an authorized committee of the 28 commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule 29 for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in 30 format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public 31 notice of any revisions shall be posted on the internet site 32 of the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge 33 by any person for a period of thirty days after posting. The 34 revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision 35 -22- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 22/ 30 H.F. 547 results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall 1 be made in writing and delivered to the commission prior to 2 the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the 3 revision will take effect without further action. If the 4 revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect 5 without the approval of the commission. 6 n. No member stateâs rulemaking process or procedural 7 requirements shall apply to the commission. The commission 8 shall have no authority over any member stateâs rulemaking 9 process or procedural requirements that do not pertain to the 10 compact. 11 o. Nothing in this compact, nor any rule or regulation 12 of the commission, shall be construed to limit, restrict, 13 or in any way reduce the ability of a member state to enact 14 and enforce laws, regulations, or other rules related to the 15 practice of respiratory therapy in that state where those laws, 16 regulations, or other rules are not inconsistent with the 17 provisions of this compact. 18 10. Oversight, dispute resolution, and enforcement. 19 a. Oversight. 20 (1) The executive and judicial branches of state government 21 in each member state shall enforce this compact and take all 22 actions necessary and appropriate to implement the compact. 23 (2) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against 24 the commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a 25 court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office 26 of the commission is located. The commission may waive 27 venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or 28 consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution 29 proceedings. Nothing in this subparagraph shall affect or 30 limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against 31 a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any 32 such similar matter. 33 (3) The commission shall be entitled to receive service 34 of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or 35 -23- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 23/ 30 H.F. 547 interpretation of the compact and shall have standing to 1 intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure 2 to provide the commission service of process shall render a 3 judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or 4 promulgated rules. 5 b. Default, technical assistance, and termination. 6 (1) If the commission determines that a member state 7 has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or 8 responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, 9 the commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting 10 state. The notice of default shall describe the default, the 11 proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that 12 the commission may take, and shall offer training and specific 13 technical assistance regarding the default. 14 (2) The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of 15 default to the other member states. 16 c. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the 17 defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon 18 an affirmative vote of a majority of the commissioners of 19 the member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits 20 conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on 21 the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does 22 not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities 23 incurred during the period of default. 24 d. Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed 25 only after all other means of securing compliance have been 26 exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall 27 be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and 28 minority leaders of the defaulting stateâs legislature, the 29 defaulting stateâs respiratory therapy licensing authority, 30 and each of the member statesâ respiratory therapy licensing 31 authorities. 32 e. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all 33 assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through 34 the effective date of termination, including obligations that 35 -24- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 24/ 30 H.F. 547 extend beyond the effective date of termination, if necessary. 1 f. Upon termination of a stateâs membership from this 2 compact, that state shall immediately provide notice to all 3 licensees and compact privilege holders of which the commission 4 has a record within that state of such termination. The 5 terminated state shall continue to recognize all licenses 6 granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of one hundred 7 eighty days after the date of said notice of termination. 8 g. The commission shall not bear any costs related to 9 a state that is found to be in default or that has been 10 terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing 11 between the commission and the defaulting state. 12 h. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the 13 commission by petitioning the United States district court 14 for the District of Columbia or the federal district where 15 the commission has its principal offices. The prevailing 16 party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including 17 reasonable attorney fees. 18 i. Dispute resolution. 19 (1) Upon request by a member state, the commission shall 20 attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise 21 among member states and between member and nonmember states. 22 (2) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for 23 both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as 24 appropriate. 25 j. Enforcement. 26 (1) By majority vote, as may be further provided by rule, 27 the commission may initiate legal action against a member state 28 in default in the United States district court for the District 29 of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has 30 its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions 31 of the compact and its promulgated rules. A member state by 32 enactment of this compact consents to venue and jurisdiction 33 in such court for the purposes set forth in this subparagraph. 34 The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and 35 -25- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 25/ 30 H.F. 547 damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, 1 the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such 2 litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. The remedies 3 in this subparagraph shall not be the exclusive remedies of the 4 commission. The commission may pursue other remedies available 5 under federal or the defaulting member stateâs law. 6 (2) A member state may initiate legal action against the 7 commission in the United States district court for the District 8 of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has 9 its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions 10 of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought 11 may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event 12 judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall 13 be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable 14 attorney fees. 15 (3) No person other than a member state shall enforce this 16 compact against the commission. 17 11. Effective date, withdrawal, and amendment. 18 a. The compact shall come into effect on the date on which 19 the compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh member 20 state. 21 (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the 22 commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of 23 the first seven member states to determine if the statute 24 enacted by each such charter member state is materially 25 different than the model compact. 26 (a) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be 27 materially different from the model compact shall be entitled 28 to the default process set forth in subsection 10. 29 (b) If any member state is later found to be in default or 30 is terminated or withdraws from the compact, the commission 31 shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in 32 effect even if the number of member states should be less than 33 seven. 34 (2) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the 35 -26- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 26/ 30 H.F. 547 seven initial charter member states shall be subject to the 1 process set forth herein and commission rule to determine 2 if their enactments are materially different from the model 3 compact and whether they qualify for participation in the 4 compact. 5 (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission 6 or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of 7 the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the 8 commission coming into existence shall be considered to be the 9 actions of the commission unless specifically repudiated by the 10 commission. The commission shall own and have all rights to 11 any intellectual property developed on behalf or in furtherance 12 of the commission by individuals or entities involved in 13 organizing or establishing the commission, as may be further 14 set forth in rules of the commission. 15 (4) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the 16 commissionâs initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be 17 subject to the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on 18 which the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has 19 been previously adopted by the commission shall have the full 20 force and effect of law on the date the compact becomes law in 21 that state. 22 b. Any member state may withdraw from this compact by 23 enacting a statute repealing the same. 24 (1) A member stateâs withdrawal shall not take effect 25 until one hundred eighty days after enactment of the repealing 26 statute. 27 (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirements 28 of the withdrawing stateâs respiratory therapy licensing 29 authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action 30 reporting requirements of this compact prior to the effective 31 date of withdrawal. 32 (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this 33 compact, a state shall immediately provide notice of such 34 withdrawal to all licensees and compact privilege holders 35 -27- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 27/ 30 H.F. 547 of which the commission has a record within that state. 1 Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the 2 contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize 3 all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum 4 of one hundred eighty days after the date of such notice of 5 withdrawal. 6 c. Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed 7 to invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other 8 cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember 9 state that does not conflict with the provisions of this 10 compact. 11 d. This compact may be amended by the member states. No 12 amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding 13 upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all 14 member states. 15 12. Construction and severability. 16 a. This compact and the commissionâs rulemaking authority 17 shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes 18 and the implementation and administration of the compact. 19 Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring 20 the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit the 21 commissionâs rulemaking authority solely for those purposes. 22 b. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and 23 if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact 24 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary 25 to the constitution of any member state, a state seeking 26 participation in the compact, or of the United States, or 27 the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, 28 or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of 29 competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this 30 compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, 31 agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. 32 c. Notwithstanding paragraph âbâ , the commission may deny 33 a stateâs participation in the compact or, in accordance 34 with the requirements of subsection 10, terminate a member 35 -28- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 28/ 30 H.F. 547 stateâs participation in the compact if it determines that a 1 constitutional requirement of a member state is a material 2 departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall 3 be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, 4 the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the 5 remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the 6 member state affected as to all severable matters. 7 13. Consistent effect and conflict with other state laws. 8 a. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent or inhibit the 9 enforcement of any other law of a member state that is not 10 inconsistent with the compact. 11 b. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal 12 requirements in a member state in conflict with the compact 13 are superseded to the extent of the conflict, including any 14 subsequently enacted state laws. 15 c. All permissible agreements between the commission and the 16 member states are binding in accordance with their terms. 17 d. Other than as expressly set forth herein, nothing in this 18 compact impacts initial licensure. 19 EXPLANATION 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 21 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 22 This bill establishes the respiratory care interstate 23 compact. 24 The compact establishes a system whereby a respiratory 25 therapist licensed to practice in one participating state 26 may practice in another participating state under a compact 27 privilege without applying for a license in that state. The 28 compact imposes certain minimum requirements on the licensure 29 of respiratory therapists in participating states. 30 The compact creates a commission to administer the operation 31 of the compact. The commission is an instrumentality of the 32 participating states. The compact includes provisions relating 33 to the establishment and membership of the commission; powers 34 of the commission; meetings and voting requirements of the 35 -29- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 29/ 30 H.F. 547 commission; commission bylaws and rules; commission committees; 1 commission finances; the establishment of a data system; 2 compacting state compliance; venue for judicial proceedings; 3 defense and indemnification; effective dates and amendments to 4 the compact; withdrawal, default, and expulsion; severability 5 and construction; and the binding effect of the compact and 6 other laws. 7 The compact becomes effective upon the adoption of the 8 compact by the seventh participating state. 9 -30- LSB 1867HV (1) 91 ss/ko 30/ 30
