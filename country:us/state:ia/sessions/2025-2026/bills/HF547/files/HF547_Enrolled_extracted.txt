(1) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule, provided that the changes are consistent with the original purpose of the proposed rule. (2) The commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters. (3) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in paragraph âlâ , the effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than thirty days after issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the rule. l. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule with twenty-four hoursâ notice, and with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the compact and in this subsection shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to do one of the following: (1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare. House File 547, p. 21 (2) Prevent a loss of commission or member state funds. (3) Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established by federal law or rule. (4) Protect public health and safety. m. The commission or an authorized committee of the commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the internet site of the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission. n. No member stateâs rulemaking process or procedural requirements shall apply to the commission. The commission shall have no authority over any member stateâs rulemaking process or procedural requirements that do not pertain to the compact. o. Nothing in this compact, nor any rule or regulation of the commission, shall be construed to limit, restrict, or in any way reduce the ability of a member state to enact and enforce laws, regulations, or other rules related to the practice of respiratory therapy in that state where those laws, regulations, or other rules are not inconsistent with the provisions of this compact. 10. Oversight, dispute resolution, and enforcement. a. Oversight. (1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the compact. (2) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The commission may waive House File 547, p. 22 venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing in this subparagraph shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter. (3) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or promulgated rules. b. Default, technical assistance, and termination. (1) If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the commission may take, and shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the default. (2) The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other member states. c. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the commissioners of the member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default. d. Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting stateâs legislature, the defaulting stateâs respiratory therapy licensing authority, and each of the member statesâ respiratory therapy licensing House File 547, p. 23 authorities. e. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination, if necessary. f. Upon termination of a stateâs membership from this compact, that state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees and compact privilege holders of which the commission has a record within that state of such termination. The terminated state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of one hundred eighty days after the date of said notice of termination. g. The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state. h. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. i. Dispute resolution. (1) Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and between member and nonmember states. (2) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate. j. Enforcement. (1) By majority vote, as may be further provided by rule, the commission may initiate legal action against a member state in default in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. A member state by enactment of this compact consents to venue and jurisdiction in such court for the purposes set forth in this subparagraph. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and House File 547, p. 24 damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. The remedies in this subparagraph shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue other remedies available under federal or the defaulting member stateâs law. (2) A member state may initiate legal action against the commission in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. (3) No person other than a member state shall enforce this compact against the commission. 11. Effective date, withdrawal, and amendment. a. The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state. (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the first seven member states to determine if the statute enacted by each such charter member state is materially different than the model compact. (a) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model compact shall be entitled to the default process set forth in subsection 10. (b) If any member state is later found to be in default or is terminated or withdraws from the compact, the commission shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if the number of member states should be less than seven. (2) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven initial charter member states shall be subject to the process set forth herein and commission rule to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model compact and whether they qualify for participation in the House File 547, p. 25 compact. (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into existence shall be considered to be the actions of the commission unless specifically repudiated by the commission. The commission shall own and have all rights to any intellectual property developed on behalf or in furtherance of the commission by individuals or entities involved in organizing or establishing the commission, as may be further set forth in rules of the commission. (4) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the commissionâs initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the date the compact becomes law in that state. b. Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same. (1) A member stateâs withdrawal shall not take effect until one hundred eighty days after enactment of the repealing statute. (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirements of the withdrawing stateâs respiratory therapy licensing authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal. (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees and compact privilege holders of which the commission has a record within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of one hundred eighty days after the date of such notice of withdrawal. c. Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other House File 547, p. 26 cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact. d. This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states. 12. Construction and severability. a. This compact and the commissionâs rulemaking authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit the commissionâs rulemaking authority solely for those purposes. b. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. c. Notwithstanding paragraph âbâ , the commission may deny a stateâs participation in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of subsection 10, terminate a member stateâs participation in the compact if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters. 13. Consistent effect and conflict with other state laws. a. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the compact. b. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal House File 547, p. 27 requirements in a member state in conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict, including any subsequently enacted state laws. c. All permissible agreements between the commission and the member states are binding in accordance with their terms. d. Other than as expressly set forth herein, nothing in this compact impacts initial licensure. ______________________________ PAT GRASSLEY Speaker of the House ______________________________ AMY SINCLAIR President of the Senate I hereby certify that this bill originated in the House and is known as House File 547, Ninety-first General Assembly. ______________________________ MEGHAN NELSON Chief Clerk of the House Approved _______________, 2025 ______________________________ KIM REYNOLDS Governor

Any information submitted to the data system that is subsequently expunged pursuant to federal law or the laws of the member state contributing the information shall be removed from the data system. 9. Rulemaking. a. The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule shall be invalid and have no force and effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because the commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or the powers granted under this subsection, or based upon another House File 547, p. 19 applicable standard of review. b. For purposes of the compact, the rules of the commission shall have the force of law in each member state. c. The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this subsection and the rules adopted pursuant to this subsection. Rules shall become binding as of the date specified in each rule. d. If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule or portion of a rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, within four years of the date of application of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any member state. e. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission. f. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments. g. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the commission, and at least thirty days in advance of the meeting at which the commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed rule, the commission shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking by all of the following methods: (1) On the internet site of the commission or other publicly accessible platform. (2) To persons who have requested notice of the commissionâs notices of proposed rulemaking. (3) In such other way as the commission may by rule specify. h. The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include all of the following: (1) The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the commission will hear public comments on the proposed rule and, if different, the time, date, and location of the meeting where the commission will consider and vote on the proposed rule. (2) If the hearing is held via telecommunication, videoconference, or other electronic means, the commission shall include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice of proposed rulemaking. House File 547, p. 20 (3) The text of the proposed rule and the reason therefor. (4) A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person. (5) The manner in which interested persons may submit written comments. i. All hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the recording and all written comments and documents received by the commission in response to the proposed rule shall be available to the public. j. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this subsection. k. The commission shall, by majority vote of all commissioners, take final action on the proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule. (1) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule, provided that the changes are consistent with the original purpose of the proposed rule. (2) The commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters. (3) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in paragraph âlâ , the effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than thirty days after issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the rule. l. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule with twenty-four hoursâ notice, and with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the compact and in this subsection shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to do one of the following: (1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare. House File 547, p. 21 (2) Prevent a loss of commission or member state funds. (3) Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established by federal law or rule. (4) Protect public health and safety. m. The commission or an authorized committee of the commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the internet site of the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission. n. No member stateâs rulemaking process or procedural requirements shall apply to the commission. The commission shall have no authority over any member stateâs rulemaking process or procedural requirements that do not pertain to the compact. o. Nothing in this compact, nor any rule or regulation of the commission, shall be construed to limit, restrict, or in any way reduce the ability of a member state to enact and enforce laws, regulations, or other rules related to the practice of respiratory therapy in that state where those laws, regulations, or other rules are not inconsistent with the provisions of this compact. 10. Oversight, dispute resolution, and enforcement. a. Oversight. (1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the compact. (2) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The commission may waive House File 547, p. 22 venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing in this subparagraph shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter. (3) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or promulgated rules. b. Default, technical assistance, and termination. (1) If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the commission may take, and shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the default. (2) The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other member states. c. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the commissioners of the member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default. d. Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting stateâs legislature, the defaulting stateâs respiratory therapy licensing authority, and each of the member statesâ respiratory therapy licensing House File 547, p. 23 authorities. e. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination, if necessary. f. Upon termination of a stateâs membership from this compact, that state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees and compact privilege holders of which the commission has a record within that state of such termination. The terminated state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of one hundred eighty days after the date of said notice of termination. g. The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state. h. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. i. Dispute resolution. (1) Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and between member and nonmember states. (2) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate. j. Enforcement. (1) By majority vote, as may be further provided by rule, the commission may initiate legal action against a member state in default in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. A member state by enactment of this compact consents to venue and jurisdiction in such court for the purposes set forth in this subparagraph. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and House File 547, p. 24 damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. The remedies in this subparagraph shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue other remedies available under federal or the defaulting member stateâs law. (2) A member state may initiate legal action against the commission in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. (3) No person other than a member state shall enforce this compact against the commission. 11. Effective date, withdrawal, and amendment. a. The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state. (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the first seven member states to determine if the statute enacted by each such charter member state is materially different than the model compact. (a) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model compact shall be entitled to the default process set forth in subsection 10. (b) If any member state is later found to be in default or is terminated or withdraws from the compact, the commission shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if the number of member states should be less than seven. (2) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven initial charter member states shall be subject to the process set forth herein and commission rule to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model compact and whether they qualify for participation in the House File 547, p. 25 compact. (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into existence shall be considered to be the actions of the commission unless specifically repudiated by the commission. The commission shall own and have all rights to any intellectual property developed on behalf or in furtherance of the commission by individuals or entities involved in organizing or establishing the commission, as may be further set forth in rules of the commission. (4) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the commissionâs initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the date the compact becomes law in that state. b. Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same. (1) A member stateâs withdrawal shall not take effect until one hundred eighty days after enactment of the repealing statute. (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirements of the withdrawing stateâs respiratory therapy licensing authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal. (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees and compact privilege holders of which the commission has a record within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of one hundred eighty days after the date of such notice of withdrawal. c. Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other House File 547, p. 26 cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact. d. This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states. 12. Construction and severability. a. This compact and the commissionâs rulemaking authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit the commissionâs rulemaking authority solely for those purposes. b. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. c. Notwithstanding paragraph âbâ , the commission may deny a stateâs participation in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of subsection 10, terminate a member stateâs participation in the compact if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters. 13. Consistent effect and conflict with other state laws. a. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the compact. b. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal House File 547, p. 27 requirements in a member state in conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict, including any subsequently enacted state laws. c. All permissible agreements between the commission and the member states are binding in accordance with their terms. d. Other than as expressly set forth herein, nothing in this compact impacts initial licensure. ______________________________ PAT GRASSLEY Speaker of the House ______________________________ AMY SINCLAIR President of the Senate I hereby certify that this bill originated in the House and is known as House File 547, Ninety-first General Assembly. ______________________________ MEGHAN NELSON Chief Clerk of the House Approved _______________, 2025 ______________________________ KIM REYNOLDS Governor
