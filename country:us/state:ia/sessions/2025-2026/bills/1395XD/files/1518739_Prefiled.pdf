1 Section 1. Section 321P.2, subsection 2, unnumbered
2 paragraph 1, Code 2025, is amended to read as follows:
3 A local authority may apply for a permit by submitting an
4 application to the department in a manner determined by the
5 department. The department may, in its discretion, approve
6 or disapprove the application for and issue a permit based on
7 the department’s determination that a system is appropriate
8 and necessary and the least restrictive means to address the
9 critical traffic safety issues at a location. If, in the
10 judgment of the department, a system is inappropriate or
11 unnecessary or not the least restrictive means to address the
12 critical traffic safety issues at a location, the department
13 shall deny the application for a permit. If the department
14 denies an application, the department shall provide the local
15 authority the reason for denial. The department shall only
16 issue one permit for a local authority, which shall set forth
17 all locations at which a local authority is authorized to use
18 a system. A local authority may submit an application to the
19 department to update the local authority’s permit with a new
20 location in the same manner and with the same information as
21 required for the initial permit. An application for a permit
22 must contain all of the following for a location at which the
23 local authority intends to operate a system:
24 Sec. 2. NEW SECTION. 321P.2A Permit suspension and
25 revocation.
26 1. The department may suspend a permit issued to a local
27 authority if the department determines the local authority
28 violated this chapter or a rule adopted pursuant to this
29 chapter. If the department suspends a permit, the permit shall
30 remain suspended until the local authority demonstrates to the
31 department that the local authority is complying with this
32 chapter and rules adopted pursuant to this chapter.
33 2. The department may revoke a permit issued to a local
34 authority or remove an authorized location from a permit if
35 the department determines the continued use of a system is no

1 longer appropriate, necessary, and the least restrictive means
2 to address the critical traffic safety issues at the location.
3 The department may also revoke a permit issued to a local
4 authority if the department determines the local authority is
5 in continuous noncompliance with this chapter or a rule adopted
6 pursuant to this chapter. A local authority whose permit is
7 revoked may reapply for a permit in accordance with section
8 321P.2.
9 Sec. 3. NEW SECTION. 321P.10 Rulemaking authority —— final
10 agency action.
11 1. The department shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A
12 implementing, administering, and interpreting this chapter.
13 The department shall give due regard for critical traffic
14 safety issues and shall ensure the rules are consistent with
15 any federal requirements.
16 2. For purposes of chapter 17A, the decision of the
17 presiding officer in a contested case on matters under this
18 chapter shall be the final agency action for purposes of
19 judicial review.
20 EXPLANATION
21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
22 the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
23 In 2024, the general assembly enacted Code chapter 321P
24 regulating automated traffic enforcement (ATE) in Iowa. This
25 bill makes certain changes relating to the administration of
26 the ATE Code chapter by the department of transportation (DOT).
27 Under current law, the DOT may approve or disapprove a
28 local authority’s application for a permit based on the DOT’s
29 determination whether a system is appropriate and necessary and
30 the least restrictive means to address the critical traffic
31 safety issues at a location. The bill requires the DOT to deny
32 an application if the DOT determines a system does not comply
33 with any one of those requirements. The DOT must provide the
34 reason for denial to the local authority.
35 The bill grants authority to the DOT to suspend and revoke

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 permits previously issued to local authorities. A suspended
2 permit must remain suspended until the local authority
3 demonstrates to the DOT that the local authority is complying
4 with ATE law and rules. The bill authorizes the DOT to revoke
5 a permit or remove an authorized location if the DOT determines
6 the continued use of a system is no longer appropriate,
7 necessary, and the least restrictive means to address critical
8 traffic safety issues. In addition, the DOT may revoke a
9 permit if the local authority is in continuous noncompliance
10 with ATE law or rules. A local authority whose permit is
11 revoked may reapply for a permit in accordance with Code
12 section 321P.2.
13 The bill grants the DOT rulemaking authority pursuant
14 to Code chapter 17A. The DOT is required to adopt rules
15 implementing, administering, and interpreting Code chapter
16 321P. The DOT must give due regard for critical traffic safety
17 issues and ensure the rules are consistent with any federal
18 requirements.
19 The bill provides that in a contested case on ATE matters,
20 governed by Code chapter 17A, the decision of the presiding
21 officer is the final agency action and not subject to further
22 agency appeal for purposes of judicial review.
