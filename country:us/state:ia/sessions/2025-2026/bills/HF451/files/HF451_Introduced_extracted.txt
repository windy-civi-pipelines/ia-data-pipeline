By operation of 33 law, political subdivisions are required to comply with any 34 state mandate included in the bill. 35 -24- LSB 2701YH (3) 91 dg/jh 24/ 25 H.F. 451 The bill authorizes the attorney general to adopt rules to 1 administer and interpret the bill. 2 The bill requires the attorney general to create a 3 transitional reporting system within 30 days following the 4 billâs effective date that will operate until 59 days following 5 the billâs effective date.
