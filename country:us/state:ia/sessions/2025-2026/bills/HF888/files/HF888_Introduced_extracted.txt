Be subject to and comply with the 28 requirements of section 256.11, subsection 5, paragraph 29 âfâ , relating to the prohibition against incorporating 30 gender-neutral language into world language instruction if 31 the world language being taught utilizes a grammatical gender 32 system in the same manner as a school district. 33 EXPLANATION 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 35 -4- LSB 1502HV (2) 91 jda/jh 4/ 7 H.F. 888 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 1 This bill relates to education, including by modifying 2 provisions related to private instruction, world language 3 instruction, and dual enrollment. 4 DIVISION I ââ PRIVATE INSTRUCTION. Current law authorizes 5 the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of a child of 6 compulsory attendance age to place the child under competent 7 private instruction or independent private instruction. 8 Current law requires a childâs parent, guardian, or legal 9 custodian who is placing the child under competent private 10 instruction for the first time to provide the childâs school 11 district of residence with evidence that the child has had the 12 immunizations required under Code section 139A.8 (immunization 13 of children), and, if the child is elementary school age, a 14 blood lead test.

This 22 provision takes effect upon enactment and applies to any 23 diplomas or credentials issued before, on, or after the new 24 Code sectionâs effective date. 25 The bill prohibits the state, a political subdivision of the 26 state, a community college, institutions of higher education 27 under the control of the state board of regents, or an 28 accredited private institution from discriminating against any 29 individual based on the source of the individualâs diploma or 30 credential and shall treat a diploma or credential awarded for 31 completion of a program of secondary education under competent 32 private instruction or independent private instruction the 33 same as a high school diploma awarded by a school district or 34 accredited nonpublic school. This provision takes effect upon 35 -6- LSB 1502HV (2) 91 jda/jh 6/ 7 H.F. 888 enactment and applies to any diplomas or credentials issued 1 before, on, or after the new Code sectionâs effective date. 2 The bill provides that the parent, guardian, or legal 3 custodian of a child of compulsory attendance age shall 4 have the authority to execute any document required by law 5 to verify the placement of a child under competent private 6 instruction or independent private instruction, the childâs 7 full-time or part-time status in competent private instruction 8 or independent private instruction, the grades the child has 9 obtained in competent private instruction or independent 10 private instruction, or any other required educational 11 information. 12 DIVISION II ââ WORLD LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION. The bill 13 modifies provisions related to world language instruction in 14 grades 9 through 12 in school districts, accredited nonpublic 15 schools, charter schools, and innovation zone schools by 16 prohibiting the incorporation of gender-neutral language when 17 the world language being taught utilizes a grammatical gender 18 system. 19 -7- LSB 1502HV (2) 91 jda/jh 7/ 7
