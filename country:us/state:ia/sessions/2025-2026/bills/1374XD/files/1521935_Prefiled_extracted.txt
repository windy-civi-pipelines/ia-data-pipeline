1 This bill relates to judicial officer salaries. Under
2 current law, the general assembly determines the salaries
3 of judicial officers by enacting the salaries in annual
4 appropriations bills.
5 The bill instead creates a formula to calculate judicial
6 officer salaries. The bill requires the judicial officer
7 salaries to be paid from the moneys appropriated to the
8 judicial branch in a given fiscal year. The bill provides an
9 increase over four fiscal years for a state district judge’s
10 salary from 71 to 75 percent of the salary of a federal
11 district judge, and sets the salary of other judicial officers
12 based on a percentage of the salary of a state district judge
13 as follows: the chief justice of the supreme court, 124
14 percent; other justices of the supreme court, 119 percent; the
15 chief judge of the court of appeals, 111 percent; a judge of
16 the court of appeals except the chief judge, 107 percent; a
17 chief judge of a judicial district, 104 percent; a district
18 associate judge, associate juvenile judge, or associate probate
19 judge, 89 percent; a magistrate, 27 percent, subject to Code
20 section 602.6402 (additional magistrate allowed); and a senior
21 judge, 6 percent.
22 The bill allows the supreme court to provide lower salaries
23 for judicial officers if the supreme court decides that the
24 moneys appropriated in a given fiscal year are not sufficient
25 to provide the full allowable salaries for judicial officers,
26 or if other good cause exists.
27 The bill makes conforming changes to Code sections 602.9104
28 and 602.9204. By operation of law, the bill affects the
29 salaries of county attorneys of counties with a population of
30 200,000 or less (Code section 331.752(5)).
31 The bill takes effect June 20, 2025.
