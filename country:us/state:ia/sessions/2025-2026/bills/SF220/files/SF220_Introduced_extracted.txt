NEW SECTION . 135S.7 Severability. 24 If any provision of this chapter or its application to any 25 person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity shall 26 not affect other provisions or applications of this chapter 27 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or 28 application, and to this end the provisions of this chapter are 29 severable. 30 EXPLANATION 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 32 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 33 This bill relates to protections for medical practitioners 34 (practitioner), health care institutions (institution), and 35 -7- LSB 1347XS (5) 91 lh/ko 7/ 10 S.F. 220 health care payors (payor), involving exercise of conscience, 1 whistleblower activities, and free speech. 2 The bill provides definitions for âconscienceâ, 3 âdiscriminationâ, âhealth care institutionâ, âhealth care 4 payorâ, âhealth care servicesâ, âmedical practitionerâ, and 5 âparticipate in a health care serviceâ. 6 The bill provides that a practitioner, institution, or 7 payor has the right not to participate in or pay for a health 8 care service (service) that violates the practitionerâs, 9 institutionâs, or payorâs conscience. A practitioner, 10 institution, or payor who refuses to participate in a service 11 due to exercise of conscience shall not be discriminated 12 against for refusing to participate. 13 The bill is not to be construed to relieve a practitioner, 14 institution, or payor of the requirement under federal law to 15 provide emergency medical services to certain individuals. 16 The bill provides that a practitioner, institution, or payor 17 that holds itself out to the public as religion-based, as 18 described in the bill, shall have the right to make employment, 19 staffing, contracting, and admitting privilege decisions 20 consistent with the entityâs religious beliefs. 21 The bill provides that a practitioner, institution, or payor 22 shall not be civilly, criminally, or administratively liable 23 for the practitionerâs, institutionâs, or payorâs exercise of 24 conscience. An institution shall not be civilly, criminally, 25 or administratively liable for the excise of conscience by 26 a practitioner employed, contracted, or granted admitting 27 privileges by the institution. 28 The bill provides whistleblower protections by providing 29 that a practitioner, institution, or payor shall not be 30 discriminated against because the practitioner, institution, or 31 payor takes certain actions, as described in the bill, relating 32 to a suspected violation of the bill. The bill prohibits 33 discrimination against a practitioner, institution, or payor 34 because the practitioner, institution, or payor discloses 35 -8- LSB 1347XS (5) 91 lh/ko 8/ 10 S.F. 220 information as described in the bill. The bill is not to 1 be construed to exempt a person from the requirements of the 2 federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. 3 The bill also provides that the department of health 4 and human services (HHS), a health professional licensing 5 board, or any other state licensing or certifying entity of 6 a practitioner, institution, or payor shall not reprimand, 7 sanction, or revoke or threaten to revoke a license or 8 certification of a practitioner, institution, or payor 9 for engaging in speech, expressive activity (activity), 10 or association protected under the first amendment unless 11 HHS, the licensing board, or other licensing or certifying 12 entity demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that 13 the speech, activity, or association was the direct cause 14 of physical harm to a person with whom the practitioner, 15 institution, or payor had a medical practitioner-patient or 16 medical practitioner-client relationship within the three 17 years immediately preceding the incident of physical harm. 18 Within 21 days of receiving a complaint alleging a violation 19 of speech, activity, or association as described in the bill, 20 HHS, a licensing board, or other licensing or certifying entity 21 shall provide the practitioner, institution, or payor with a 22 copy of the complaint. If HHS, a licensing board, or other 23 licensing or certifying entity fails to provide the complaint 24 within 21 days, HHS, the licensing board, or other certifying 25 entity shall pay the practitioner, institution, or payor an 26 administrative penalty of $500 for each day of noncompliance. 27 If HHS, a licensing board, or other licensing or certifying 28 entity revokes or refuses to issue a certification or 29 credential to a practitioner, institution, or payor who is in 30 compliance with the bill and did not provide medical advice or 31 treatment to a patient or client, the state shall not contract 32 with, recognize, approve, or require the certification or 33 credential issued or approved by HHS, the licensing board, or 34 other licensing or certifying entity. 35 -9- LSB 1347XS (5) 91 lh/ko 9/ 10 S.F. 220 The bill provides that it is unlawful for a person to 1 interfere or attempt to interfere with the right not to 2 participate in or pay for a service, or with the whistleblower 3 or free speech rights and protections authorized under the 4 bill. An institution, payor, or practitioner injured by 5 unlawful interference under the bill is entitled to bring a 6 civil action that, if successful, may result in relief as 7 detailed in the bill. The bill shall not be construed to deny, 8 abrogate, or impair a common law or statutory right, remedy, 9 or prohibition. An additional burden or expense arising from 10 another practitionerâs, institutionâs, or payorâs exercise 11 of conscience is not a defense to a violation of the bill. 12 The bill prohibits a person from bringing a civil action 13 against a person who declines to use or purchase a service 14 from a practitioner, institution, or payor exercising their 15 conscience. 16 The bill includes a severability clause. 17 -10- LSB 1347XS (5) 91 lh/ko 10/ 10
