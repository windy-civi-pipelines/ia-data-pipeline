30 EXPLANATION
31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
32 the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
33 This bill requires a fiduciary to vote all shares of a
34 pension benefit plan established, maintained, or offered by
35 a public entity solely in the best economic interest of the
LSB 1056XD (2) 91
-8- sc/ns 8/10

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 plan participants and beneficiaries. The bill creates the
2 rebuttable presumption that, if a fiduciary’s vote aligns with
3 the recommendation of the board of directors of the issuer
4 of the shares or if the fiduciary or a third party conducts
5 and documents an economic analysis showing that the vote is
6 in the best economic interest of the plan participants and
7 beneficiaries, the vote is in the best interest of the plan
8 participants and beneficiaries. The bill prohibits a fiduciary
9 from voting shares of a plan based on any environmental,
10 social, policy, governance, or ideological goal that is
11 not in the best economic interest of plan participants and
12 beneficiaries.
13 The bill requires a fiduciary to annually report to
14 the treasurer of state any vote inconsistent with the
15 recommendation of an issuer’s board of directors and the
16 economic analysis on which the fiduciary relied. This report
17 must be certified by the fiduciary’s chief executive officer
18 and chief financial officer.
19 The bill also requires a fiduciary to review its economic
20 analysis every three years to ensure that the fiduciary’s
21 models, procedures, and processes predict the best economic
22 interest of the plan participants and beneficiaries.
23 The bill permits a court to award court costs and reasonable
24 attorney fees to the prevailing party in a suit concerning
25 fiduciary voting responsibilities under the bill.
26 The bill prohibits a proxy advisory firm from providing
27 proxy voting advice regarding shareholder-sponsored proposals
28 to an entity that the state regulates unless the advice is
29 based solely on the best economic interests of the enterprise’s
30 shareholders. If a proxy advisory firm’s advice follows the
31 recommendation of the board of directors of the issuer of the
32 shares or if the proxy advisory firm conducts and documents an
33 economic analysis demonstrating that the vote is in the best
34 economic interest of the plan participants and beneficiaries,
35 then the advice is presumed to be based solely on the best
LSB 1056XD (2) 91
-9- sc/ns 9/10

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 economic interest of the enterprise’s shareholders. A proxy
2 advisory firm must submit an annual report to the treasurer of
3 state disclosing any vote inconsistent with the issuer’s board
4 of directors’ recommendations and the economic analysis on
5 which the proxy advisory firm relied.
6 The bill permits an investor, beneficiary, or participant of
7 a plan to submit a request for the economic analysis conducted
8 for a fiduciary’s vote to the investment company that owns
9 shares of an enterprise regulated by the state or the plan if
10 the individual has reason to believe the provisions of the bill
11 have not been met. The investment company or plan must respond
12 in writing within 90 days by providing the requested economic
13 analysis or informing the individual that no economic analysis
14 was conducted or the vote aligned with the recommendation
15 of the board of directors of the issuer of the shares. The
16 investment company or plan must provide such a response without
17 cost up to twice annually per consumer.
18 The bill allows the attorney general to investigate any
19 suspected violations of the bill and to enforce the bill’s
20 provisions by initiating an action in the name of the state
21 and seeking civil penalties for each violation. Each share
22 not voted in the best economic interest of the shareholder
23 qualifies as a separate violation and constitutes irreparable
24 harm. The bill requires civil penalties to be in equity and
25 to not exceed $1,000 per violation. Civil penalties collected
26 under the bill are deposited in the general fund of the state.
27 The bill makes conforming changes.
