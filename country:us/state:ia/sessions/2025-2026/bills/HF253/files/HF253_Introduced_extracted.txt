The bill requires 33 school districts to report annually to DE specified information 34 related to teachers providing computer science instruction and 35 -7- LSB 1134HH (6) 91 jda/jh 7/ 8 H.F. 253 students involved in computer science courses. 1 The bill requires that the rules adopted by the BOEE 2 establishing nontraditional pathways for obtaining endorsements 3 and authorizations for computer science instruction also 4 include opportunities to obtain such endorsements or 5 authorizations through instruction that is delivered primarily 6 over the internet that may be used to demonstrate competence 7 in computer science instruction for teachers under an initial 8 or conditional license. 9 Current law establishes a computer science professional 10 development incentive fund in the state treasury under the 11 control of DE. Current law authorizes DE to disburse moneys 12 contained in the fund to a school district or accredited 13 nonpublic school to provide tuition reimbursement for Iowa 14 teachers seeking endorsements or authorizations for computer 15 science from the BOEE. The bill modifies this provision 16 to allow such tuition reimbursement to be provided to Iowa 17 teachers under an initial or conditional license. 18 The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code 19 section 25B.3. The bill requires that the state cost of 20 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school 21 district from state school foundation aid received by the 22 school district under Code section 257.16. The specification 23 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate 24 funding-related requirements of Code section 25B.2. The 25 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the 26 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state 27 mandates included in the bill. 28 -8- LSB 1134HH (6) 91 jda/jh 8/ 8
