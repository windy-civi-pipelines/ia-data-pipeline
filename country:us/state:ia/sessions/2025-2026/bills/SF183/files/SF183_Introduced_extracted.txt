This bill amends provisions 17 regulating animal feeding operations (AFOs) in which 18 agricultural animals are confined and fed and maintained 19 for 45 days or more in any 12-month period, and includes 20 all structures used for the storage of manure from animals 21 in the operation and the discharge of manure or effluent 22 originating from the AFO (Code chapters 459 and 459A). The 23 regulations are administered and enforced by the department of 24 natural resources (DNR) including the environmental protection 25 commission (EPC). State law recognizes several types of 26 AFOs, including confinement feeding operations (CFOs) in 27 which animals are housed (confined) under roof (Code chapter 28 459). Special provisions govern open feedlots where animals 29 are kept in unroofed or partially roofed structures (Code 30 chapter 459A). In both cases, natural vegetation is not 31 available to feed the animals. In Iowa, a CFO is subject 32 to both air and water protection statutes and rules. Under 33 water quality regulations, the owner or operator of an AFO may 34 be required to obtain authorization from DNR to do business. 35 -8- LSB 1489XS (7) 91 da/ns 8/ 11 S.F. 183 The authorization takes the form of a construction permit for 1 a CFO (Code section 459.304) or an open feedlot operation 2 (Code section 459A.205) or a manure management plan for a CFO 3 (Code section 459.312) or nutrient management plan for an open 4 feedlot operation (Code section 459A.208). The EPC may by 5 rule require the owner or operator of a CFO to install a water 6 pollution monitoring system as part of an unformed (dirt or 7 clay) manure storage structure (Code section 459.311). The 8 level of regulation sometimes depends upon a formula that 9 calculates the degree to which the AFO presents a threat to 10 water quality measured by: (1) the type of animals maintained 11 and (2) the number of animals maintained. For example, a 12 construction permit is required for a CFO that has an animal 13 unit capacity (AUC) of at least 1,000 animal units (AUs) (Code 14 section 459.303) and each head of butcher or breeding swine 15 weighing more than 55 pounds is assigned a special equivalency 16 factor of 0.4 animal units (Code section 459.102) (0.4 AU x 17 1,000 AUC = 400 head of such swine). 18 BACKGROUND ââ FEDERAL LAW. AFOs are also regulated under 19 federal law by the environmental protection agency (EPA) that 20 administers and enforces the national pollutant discharge 21 elimination system (NPDES) program pursuant to the federal 22 Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (33 U.S.C. ch. 26, as 23 amended, and 40 C.F.R. pts. 122 and 412). EPA contracts with 24 DNR to administer and enforce the NPDES program. Under the 25 NPDES program, AFOs are referred to as concentrated animal 26 feeding operations (CAFOs). A CAFO is classified by its own 27 formula that also factors the type and number of animals kept. 28 The regulations apply to large, medium, and small CAFOs. For 29 example, a small CAFO includes less than 750 head of swine 30 weighing 55 or more pounds, a medium CAFO includes between 750 31 and 2,499 head, and a large CAFO includes 2,500 or more head. 32 BACKGROUND ââ STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATION. The purpose 33 of both state and federal regulation is to prevent manure or 34 effluent from contaminating groundwater and surface water. 35 -9- LSB 1489XS (7) 91 da/ns 9/ 11 S.F. 183 In compliance with federal law, manure from a CAFO cannot be 1 disposed (discharged) in a manner that will cause surface 2 water or groundwater pollution (Code section 459.311). A CAFO 3 must retain all manure between periods of disposal (i.e., land 4 application). An open feedlot must install structures that 5 filter manure and effluent runoff (Code section 459A.401). 6 However, in all cases involving the treatment of wastewater, 7 and the discharge of manure and effluent originating from an 8 AFO, rules adopted by the EPC can be no more stringent than 9 federal law (Code sections 455B.173, 459.311, and 459A.401). 10 BILLâS PROVISIONS. The bill rewrites the definition of an 11 animal feeding operation based on federal law. It changes 12 the term âmedium concentrated animal feeding operationâ 13 to âmedium animal feeding operationâ without changing the 14 meaning. The bill eliminates the provision that prevents 15 EPC rules regulating wastewater, or manure or effluent 16 originating from an AFO, from being more stringent than federal 17 law. The bill provides that statutes regulating AFOs are 18 minimum requirements, and that the EPC is to adopt permitting 19 requirements by rule under the NPDES program, including for 20 those AFOs classified as medium and large CAFOs under federal 21 law. The EPC rules may exceed applicable federal standards 22 applying to a medium or large CAFO. In addition, the owner 23 or operator of a medium or large CAFO must conduct effluent 24 monitoring of pollutants discharged to navigable waters 25 through the groundwater. The owner or operator must report the 26 collected data to DNR which must publish it on its internet 27 site and submit an annual report to the EPA. 28 CIVIL PENALTIES. Compliance with a statutory regulation 29 includes compliance with a rule adopted by DNR (Code section 30 459.103). A person violating a water quality regulation 31 under Code chapter 459 is subject to the administrative 32 assessment of a civil penalty by DNR of not more than $10,000 33 or a judicial assessment of a civil penalty of $5,000 (Code 34 sections 455B.109, 455B.191, and 459.603). Currently, a 35 -10- LSB 1489XS (7) 91 da/ns 10/ 11 S.F. 183 person violating a water quality regulation applying to an 1 open feedlot is subject to the judicially assessed civil 2 penalty (Code section 459A.502). The bill also provides that 3 the person is subject to the administratively assessed civil 4 penalty. 5 -11- LSB 1489XS (7) 91 da/ns 11/ 11

This bill amends provisions 17 regulating animal feeding operations (AFOs) in which 18 agricultural animals are confined and fed and maintained 19 for 45 days or more in any 12-month period, and includes 20 all structures used for the storage of manure from animals 21 in the operation and the discharge of manure or effluent 22 originating from the AFO (Code chapters 459 and 459A). The 23 regulations are administered and enforced by the department of 24 natural resources (DNR) including the environmental protection 25 commission (EPC). State law recognizes several types of 26 AFOs, including confinement feeding operations (CFOs) in 27 which animals are housed (confined) under roof (Code chapter 28 459). Special provisions govern open feedlots where animals 29 are kept in unroofed or partially roofed structures (Code 30 chapter 459A). In both cases, natural vegetation is not 31 available to feed the animals. In Iowa, a CFO is subject 32 to both air and water protection statutes and rules. Under 33 water quality regulations, the owner or operator of an AFO may 34 be required to obtain authorization from DNR to do business. 35 -8- LSB 1489XS (7) 91 da/ns 8/ 11 S.F. 183 The authorization takes the form of a construction permit for 1 a CFO (Code section 459.304) or an open feedlot operation 2 (Code section 459A.205) or a manure management plan for a CFO 3 (Code section 459.312) or nutrient management plan for an open 4 feedlot operation (Code section 459A.208). The EPC may by 5 rule require the owner or operator of a CFO to install a water 6 pollution monitoring system as part of an unformed (dirt or 7 clay) manure storage structure (Code section 459.311). The 8 level of regulation sometimes depends upon a formula that 9 calculates the degree to which the AFO presents a threat to 10 water quality measured by: (1) the type of animals maintained 11 and (2) the number of animals maintained. For example, a 12 construction permit is required for a CFO that has an animal 13 unit capacity (AUC) of at least 1,000 animal units (AUs) (Code 14 section 459.303) and each head of butcher or breeding swine 15 weighing more than 55 pounds is assigned a special equivalency 16 factor of 0.4 animal units (Code section 459.102) (0.4 AU x 17 1,000 AUC = 400 head of such swine). 18 BACKGROUND ââ FEDERAL LAW. AFOs are also regulated under 19 federal law by the environmental protection agency (EPA) that 20 administers and enforces the national pollutant discharge 21 elimination system (NPDES) program pursuant to the federal 22 Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (33 U.S.C. ch. 26, as 23 amended, and 40 C.F.R. pts. 122 and 412). EPA contracts with 24 DNR to administer and enforce the NPDES program. Under the 25 NPDES program, AFOs are referred to as concentrated animal 26 feeding operations (CAFOs). A CAFO is classified by its own 27 formula that also factors the type and number of animals kept. 28 The regulations apply to large, medium, and small CAFOs. For 29 example, a small CAFO includes less than 750 head of swine 30 weighing 55 or more pounds, a medium CAFO includes between 750 31 and 2,499 head, and a large CAFO includes 2,500 or more head. 32 BACKGROUND ââ STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATION. The purpose 33 of both state and federal regulation is to prevent manure or 34 effluent from contaminating groundwater and surface water. 35 -9- LSB 1489XS (7) 91 da/ns 9/ 11 S.F. 183 In compliance with federal law, manure from a CAFO cannot be 1 disposed (discharged) in a manner that will cause surface 2 water or groundwater pollution (Code section 459.311). A CAFO 3 must retain all manure between periods of disposal (i.e., land 4 application). An open feedlot must install structures that 5 filter manure and effluent runoff (Code section 459A.401). 6 However, in all cases involving the treatment of wastewater, 7 and the discharge of manure and effluent originating from an 8 AFO, rules adopted by the EPC can be no more stringent than 9 federal law (Code sections 455B.173, 459.311, and 459A.401). 10 BILLâS PROVISIONS. The bill rewrites the definition of an 11 animal feeding operation based on federal law. It changes 12 the term âmedium concentrated animal feeding operationâ 13 to âmedium animal feeding operationâ without changing the 14 meaning. The bill eliminates the provision that prevents 15 EPC rules regulating wastewater, or manure or effluent 16 originating from an AFO, from being more stringent than federal 17 law. The bill provides that statutes regulating AFOs are 18 minimum requirements, and that the EPC is to adopt permitting 19 requirements by rule under the NPDES program, including for 20 those AFOs classified as medium and large CAFOs under federal 21 law. The EPC rules may exceed applicable federal standards 22 applying to a medium or large CAFO. In addition, the owner 23 or operator of a medium or large CAFO must conduct effluent 24 monitoring of pollutants discharged to navigable waters 25 through the groundwater. The owner or operator must report the 26 collected data to DNR which must publish it on its internet 27 site and submit an annual report to the EPA. 28 CIVIL PENALTIES. Compliance with a statutory regulation 29 includes compliance with a rule adopted by DNR (Code section 30 459.103). A person violating a water quality regulation 31 under Code chapter 459 is subject to the administrative 32 assessment of a civil penalty by DNR of not more than $10,000 33 or a judicial assessment of a civil penalty of $5,000 (Code 34 sections 455B.109, 455B.191, and 459.603). Currently, a 35 -10- LSB 1489XS (7) 91 da/ns 10/ 11 S.F. 183 person violating a water quality regulation applying to an 1 open feedlot is subject to the judicially assessed civil 2 penalty (Code section 459A.502). The bill also provides that 3 the person is subject to the administratively assessed civil 4 penalty. 5 -11- LSB 1489XS (7) 91 da/ns 11/ 11
