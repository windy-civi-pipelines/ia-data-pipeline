Section 99F.11, subsection 5, paragraph a, Code 2 2025, is amended to read as follows: 3 a. A tax is imposed on the sports wagering net receipts 4 received each fiscal year by a licensed operator from sports 5 wagering authorized under this chapter at the rate of six and 6 three-quarters nine percent. 7 Sec. 19. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act takes effect July 1, 8 2026. 9 EXPLANATION 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 11 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 12 Under current law, the tax rate imposed on sports wagering 13 net receipts of a licensed operator is 6.75 percent, which 14 revenues are deposited in the sports wagering receipts fund. 15 This bill increases the rate to 9 percent. For FY 2026-2027 16 and each fiscal year thereafter, the bill appropriates $8 17 million from the sports wagering receipts fund to the public 18 safety equipment fund, which is used by the department of 19 public safety (DPS) for the purchase, maintenance, and 20 replacement of equipment. The bill exempts the appropriated 21 moneys from the sports wagering receipts fund reporting 22 requirements under current law, as current law already requires 23 DPS to report on the use of moneys in the public safety 24 equipment fund. 25 Under current law, to determine the license fees and 26 regulatory fees to be charged in accordance with Code sections 27 99D.14 and 99F.10, the state racing and gaming commission 28 (commission) must use the amount appropriated to the commission 29 plus the gaming enforcement costs of DPSâs division of criminal 30 investigation. The portion of the fees associated with such 31 enforcement costs is deposited in the gaming enforcement 32 revolving fund to be annually appropriated by the general 33 assembly to DPS for gaming enforcement. The bill strikes 34 the portion of the fees that is based on DPS enforcement 35 -6- LSB 1774SZ (4) 91 ns/js 6/ 8 S.F. 625 costs, and the associated deposit in the gaming enforcement 1 revolving fund. The bill does not amend the fees associated 2 with DPS costs for fingerprinting, national criminal history 3 check requirements, and background investigations for licenses 4 to conduct internet fantasy sports contests (Code section 5 99E.4(4)). 6 Current law provides that the tax imposed on pari-mutuel 7 wagers on simulcast horse races is split in specified 8 percentages between the city and county in which the racetrack 9 is located and the commission for deposit as described in Code 10 section 8.57(3) (rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund). The bill 11 instead provides that such revenue from races conducted by a 12 licensee under Code section 99D.9D (simulcasting licensure) is 13 to be deposited in the Iowa horse racing fund, created in the 14 bill, to be used by the commission for distribution to entities 15 subject to federal horse racing regulations. The disposition 16 of revenues from races not conducted by a licensee is not 17 changed under the bill. 18 Under current law, the annual license fee to operate an 19 excursion gambling boat or gambling structure is $5 per person 20 capacity. The bill increases the rate to $10 per person 21 capacity. 22 Under current law, a tax is imposed on the adjusted gross 23 receipts received each fiscal year from excursion gambling 24 boats, gambling structures, and racetrack enclosures conducting 25 gambling games. The rate is 5 percent on the first $1 million 26 and 10 percent on the next $2 million. Over $3 million, 27 the tax rate is 22 percent for an excursion gambling boat 28 or gambling structure, and between 22 and 24 percent for a 29 racetrack enclosure based on the existence of an excursion 30 gambling boat or gambling structure in the same county, whether 31 the racetrack enclosure has been issued a table games license, 32 and whether adjusted gross receipts reached $100 million. The 33 bill eliminates this tax rate structure and imposes a tax of 22 34 percent for an excursion gambling boat or gambling structure, 35 -7- LSB 1774SZ (4) 91 ns/js 7/ 8 S.F. 625 and 24.120 percent for a racetrack enclosure, on all adjusted 1 gross receipts each fiscal year. 2 For FY 2026-2027 and each fiscal year thereafter, prior 3 to the remaining amount of the adjusted gross receipts tax 4 being credited to the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund as 5 provided under current law, an amount is credited to the gaming 6 enforcement revolving fund up to the amount appropriated by the 7 general assembly to DPS for gaming enforcement from that fund 8 for that fiscal year. 9 The bill takes effect July 1, 2026. 10 -8- LSB 1774SZ (4) 91 ns/js 8/ 8

The bill exempts the appropriated 21 moneys from the sports wagering receipts fund reporting 22 requirements under current law, as current law already requires 23 DPS to report on the use of moneys in the public safety 24 equipment fund. 25 Under current law, to determine the license fees and 26 regulatory fees to be charged in accordance with Code sections 27 99D.14 and 99F.10, the state racing and gaming commission 28 (commission) must use the amount appropriated to the commission 29 plus the gaming enforcement costs of DPSâs division of criminal 30 investigation. The portion of the fees associated with such 31 enforcement costs is deposited in the gaming enforcement 32 revolving fund to be annually appropriated by the general 33 assembly to DPS for gaming enforcement. The bill strikes 34 the portion of the fees that is based on DPS enforcement 35 -6- LSB 1774SZ (4) 91 ns/js 6/ 8 S.F. 625 costs, and the associated deposit in the gaming enforcement 1 revolving fund. The bill does not amend the fees associated 2 with DPS costs for fingerprinting, national criminal history 3 check requirements, and background investigations for licenses 4 to conduct internet fantasy sports contests (Code section 5 99E.4(4)). 6 Current law provides that the tax imposed on pari-mutuel 7 wagers on simulcast horse races is split in specified 8 percentages between the city and county in which the racetrack 9 is located and the commission for deposit as described in Code 10 section 8.57(3) (rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund). The bill 11 instead provides that such revenue from races conducted by a 12 licensee under Code section 99D.9D (simulcasting licensure) is 13 to be deposited in the Iowa horse racing fund, created in the 14 bill, to be used by the commission for distribution to entities 15 subject to federal horse racing regulations. The disposition 16 of revenues from races not conducted by a licensee is not 17 changed under the bill. 18 Under current law, the annual license fee to operate an 19 excursion gambling boat or gambling structure is $5 per person 20 capacity. The bill increases the rate to $10 per person 21 capacity. 22 Under current law, a tax is imposed on the adjusted gross 23 receipts received each fiscal year from excursion gambling 24 boats, gambling structures, and racetrack enclosures conducting 25 gambling games. The rate is 5 percent on the first $1 million 26 and 10 percent on the next $2 million. Over $3 million, 27 the tax rate is 22 percent for an excursion gambling boat 28 or gambling structure, and between 22 and 24 percent for a 29 racetrack enclosure based on the existence of an excursion 30 gambling boat or gambling structure in the same county, whether 31 the racetrack enclosure has been issued a table games license, 32 and whether adjusted gross receipts reached $100 million. The 33 bill eliminates this tax rate structure and imposes a tax of 22 34 percent for an excursion gambling boat or gambling structure, 35 -7- LSB 1774SZ (4) 91 ns/js 7/ 8 S.F. 625 and 24.120 percent for a racetrack enclosure, on all adjusted 1 gross receipts each fiscal year. 2 For FY 2026-2027 and each fiscal year thereafter, prior 3 to the remaining amount of the adjusted gross receipts tax 4 being credited to the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund as 5 provided under current law, an amount is credited to the gaming 6 enforcement revolving fund up to the amount appropriated by the 7 general assembly to DPS for gaming enforcement from that fund 8 for that fiscal year. 9 The bill takes effect July 1, 2026. 10 -8- LSB 1774SZ (4) 91 ns/js 8/ 8
