This bill provides for the administration of a 23 number of programs and regulations relating to agriculture, 24 including crop production, and specifically the application of 25 soil inputs such as fertilizers and soil conditioners (Code 26 chapters 200 and 200A) and pesticides (Code chapter 206); 27 animal health, and specifically the control of infectious or 28 contagious diseases afflicting animals (Code chapter 163), the 29 practice of veterinary medicine (Code chapter 169), and the 30 court-ordered management of livestock in immediate need of 31 sustenance (Code chapter 717); and agricultural processing, and 32 specifically the slaughter and processing of meat and poultry 33 products (Code chapter 189A). 34 CROP PRODUCTION ââ APPLICATION OF NUTRIENTS ââ BACKGROUND. 35 -32- LSB 2803SZ (2) 91 da/ns 32/ 38 S.F. 632 The department of agriculture and land stewardship (DALS) 1 regulates the composition of soil inputs, including nutrients 2 such as fertilizers which are manufactured to achieve optimum 3 plant growth under the Iowa fertilizer law (Code section 4 200.1), which includes a number of definitions (Code section 5 200.3). DALS also regulates fertilizing material which is 6 a substance used to compound a fertilizer, and a commercial 7 fertilizer which refers to a fertilizer, fertilizing material, 8 and a fertilizer-pesticide mixture. A secondary input is 9 referred to as a soil conditioner which is a substance other 10 than a fertilizer that improves the condition or structure 11 of the soil and is also used to improve plant growth. DALS 12 licenses persons who manufacture, offer for sale, sell, or 13 distribute a fertilizer or soil conditioner. The person is 14 also subject to a license fee (Code section 200.4). Each brand 15 or grade of commercial fertilizer or soil conditioner must 16 be registered with DALS (Code section 200.5). A fertilizer 17 or soil conditioner is subject to label requirements (Code 18 section 200.6). DALS imposes an inspection fee upon a 19 licensee (Code section 200.8). DALS must sample, inspect, 20 make analysis of, and test a commercial fertilizer or soil 21 conditioner distributed within the state (Code section 200.10). 22 A person is prohibited from manufacturing, offering for sale, 23 or selling a commercial fertilizer or soil conditioner that 24 is injurious to crop growth or deleterious to the soil (Code 25 section 200.11). A person selling a commercial fertilizer 26 or soil conditioner must identify substances promoting 27 its use in a manner that is not deceptive (Code section 28 200.12). DALS must adopt rules regulating equipment used 29 in storing, handling, and transporting fertilizers and soil 30 conditioners (Code section 200.14). DALS is authorized to 31 take administrative action against a licensee or registrant 32 acting in violation of the law, including by canceling the 33 license or registration (Code section 200.15), issuing a stop 34 order (Code section 200.16), or seizing a commercial fertilizer 35 -33- LSB 2803SZ (2) 91 da/ns 33/ 38 S.F. 632 or soil conditioner (Code section 200.17). A county, city, 1 or other political subdivision is prohibited from passing or 2 enforcing local legislation that regulates the use, sale, 3 distribution, storage, transportation, disposal, formulation, 4 labeling, registration, or manufacture of a fertilizer or soil 5 conditioner (Code section 200.22). A person registering a 6 pesticide must account for formulations of a fertilizer (Code 7 section 206.12). A number of Code sections include a reference 8 to soil conditioners: the definition of agricultural land 9 for purposes of eminent domain (Code section 6A.21) and urban 10 renewal (Code section 403.17) each include such a reference. 11 A transportation regulation involving hazardous materials 12 includes soil conditioners (Code section 321.1). A commodity 13 production contract lien (Code section 579B.1) covers the use 14 of a soil conditioner. An exception to the criminal offense 15 of critical infrastructure sabotage includes the use of a soil 16 conditioner (Code section 716.11). 17 CROP PRODUCTION ââ APPLICATION OF NUTRIENTS ââ BILL. The 18 bill replaces the term âsoil conditionerâ with âbeneficial 19 substanceâ, which is defined as a substance or compound that 20 is beneficial to one or more species of plants, soil, or 21 media. âBeneficial substanceâ includes a plant amendment, 22 plant biostimulant, plant inoculant, soil-amending ingredient, 23 soil-amending ingredient form, soil amendment, soil inoculant, 24 and compost. The bill changes references to the state chemist 25 to the bureau chief of the Iowa laboratory bureau (Code 26 sections 190C.22 and 200.10). 27 APPLICATION OF PESTICIDES ââ CERTIFICATION ââ BACKGROUND. 28 DALS is responsible for the administration and enforcement of 29 the âPesticide Act of Iowaâ (Code chapter 206), which in part 30 regulates the use of a pesticide by a commercial applicator, 31 public applicator, or private applicator (Code section 206.2). 32 Generally, a person acting as a commercial applicator or public 33 applicator must be certified to apply any pesticide, and a 34 person acting as a commercial applicator, public applicator, 35 -34- LSB 2803SZ (2) 91 da/ns 34/ 38 S.F. 632 or private applicator (e.g., a farmer) must be certified to 1 apply a restricted use pesticide (Code section 206.5). The 2 designation ârestricted useâ is determined by DALS (Code 3 section 206.20) and is generally based on a pesticide so 4 classified by the United States environmental protection agency 5 (40 C.F.R. Â§152.160 et seq.). DALS is required to administer 6 an educational program in cooperation with the Iowa cooperative 7 extension service in agriculture and home economics of Iowa 8 state university of science and technology. In order to be 9 certified, a person must participate in the educational program 10 by passing an examination for an initial certification and pass 11 an examination or attend instructional hours every three years 12 for the renewal of the certification (Code section 206.5). 13 APPLICATION OF PESTICIDES ââ CERTIFICATION ââ BILL. The 14 bill removes a requirement that DALS adopt by rule criteria 15 allowing a person required to be certified to complete either a 16 written or oral examination. The bill provides that DALS has 17 discretion to adopt such rules. 18 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS OR CONTAGIOUS 19 DISEASES AFFLICTING ANIMALS ââ BACKGROUND. DALS is granted 20 authority to provide for the health of animals and specifically 21 the control of an infectious or contagious disease (disease) 22 afflicting livestock populations (Code chapter 163). The term 23 âcontrolâ refers to prevention, suppression, or eradication 24 efforts (Code section 163.2). 25 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS OR CONTAGIOUS 26 DISEASES AFFLICTING ANIMALS ââ BILL. The bill provides that 27 DALS may determine and employ the most efficient and practical 28 means to identify and control a possible, imminent, or actual 29 threat to an animal population caused by a disease. 30 The bill provides that DALS may adopt any necessary rules 31 for the control of an infectious disease affecting animals 32 within the state by emergency rulemaking. When a statute 33 authorizes emergency rulemaking, an agency may adopt a rule 34 immediately without going through the periods of the rulemaking 35 -35- LSB 2803SZ (2) 91 da/ns 35/ 38 S.F. 632 process known as regulatory analysis (Code section 17A.4A) 1 and notice of intended action (Code section 17A.4(3)). The 2 bill requires that such emergency rulemaking be âdouble 3 barreledâ. Under the process known as double-barreled 4 rulemaking, when an agency files an emergency rule, it also 5 files the same rule as a notice of intended action that will 6 follow the regular rulemaking process. Normally, a rule 7 cannot be effective prior to 35 days after its filing with the 8 administrative rules coordinator and publication in the Iowa 9 administrative bulletin. Under emergency rulemaking, a rule 10 can be made effective on the date of filing and acceptance 11 by the administrative rules coordinator or any subsequent 12 date, as specified by the agency in the filing (Code section 13 17A.5(2)(b)(1)). 14 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ PRACTICE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE ââ 15 BACKGROUND. Veterinarians are regulated by the board of 16 veterinary medicine (veterinary board) which is responsible 17 for licensing and imposing disciplinary action, including the 18 suspension or revocation of a license for cause following a 19 notice and hearing before the veterinary board. The basis for 20 disciplinary action includes making a false representation, 21 being convicted of a felony in Iowa or another jurisdiction, 22 violating a statute or law of Iowa or another jurisdiction, 23 being subject to disciplinary action in another state, 24 assisting in the unlawful practice of veterinary medicine, 25 being adjudged as mentally incompetent, failing to conform 26 with an acceptable practice of veterinary medicine, and being 27 unable to practice veterinary medicine with reasonable skill 28 and safety (amended Code section 169.13). 29 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ PRACTICE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE ââ BILL. 30 The bill provides that, in addition to imposing disciplinary 31 action, the veterinary board may assess a civil penalty. 32 The amount of the civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000 per 33 violation. The attorney general may initiate a claim to 34 collect a civil penalty and any amount collected must be 35 -36- LSB 2803SZ (2) 91 da/ns 36/ 38 S.F. 632 deposited in the general fund of the state. 1 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ COURT-ORDERED MANAGEMENT OF LIVESTOCK 2 IN IMMEDIATE NEED OF SUSTENANCE ââ BACKGROUND. DALS is 3 granted the authority to petition a court to conduct a hearing 4 regarding the condition of livestock. If the court determines 5 that the livestock are in immediate need of sustenance, it 6 must issue an order directing DALS to assume supervision of 7 the livestock (Code section 717.3). The order creates a 8 super-priority lien attached to the livestock, proceeds from 9 the sale of livestock, and any associated unmanufactured 10 products, for the benefit of DALS. DALS may also petition 11 a court to order the disposition of the specified livestock. 12 The proceeds from the sale of the livestock are to be used to 13 reimburse DALS according to the lienâs super-priority status. 14 DALS may also utilize moneys deposited in the livestock 15 remediation fund (remediation fund) (Code section 459.501) 16 to pay for costs of providing for sustenance to livestock as 17 provided in the court order (Code section 717.4A). 18 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ COURT-ORDERED MANAGEMENT OF LIVESTOCK 19 IN IMMEDIATE NEED OF SUSTENANCE ââ BILL. The bill rewrites 20 a provision requiring DALS to repay the remediation fund 21 any proceeds that DALS receives from the disposition of the 22 livestock less expenses in providing for the sustenance and 23 disposition. The bill provides that if the court orders the 24 disposition of the livestock, the order shall be deemed as 25 acting in response to a petition by a receiver appointed by a 26 court in Code chapter 680. 27 AGRICULTURAL PROCESSING ââ SLAUGHTER AND PROCESSING OF MEAT 28 AND POULTRY PRODUCTS ââ LICENSURE ââ BILL. The bill provides 29 that a home food processing establishment licensed by the 30 department of inspections, appeals, and licensing is exempt 31 from DALS licensing requirements (Code chapter 137D). A home 32 food processing establishment refers to a residence in which 33 homemade food items are produced for sale, if consumption is 34 off premises and its business has gross annual sales of less 35 -37- LSB 2803SZ (2) 91 da/ns 37/ 38 S.F. 632 than $50,000 (Code section 137D.1). The bill also provides 1 that the term of a license issued by DALS to a slaughter and 2 processing establishment is extended to a two-year period (from 3 July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2027). The licensee fee is doubled 4 from $25 to $50 and from $50 to $100 to reflect the licenseâs 5 biennial term. DALS is required to prorate the license fee 6 for a new establishment. The bill makes various changes in 7 terminology to improve readability. 8 -38- LSB 2803SZ (2) 91 da/ns 38/ 38

This bill provides for the administration of a 23 number of programs and regulations relating to agriculture, 24 including crop production, and specifically the application of 25 soil inputs such as fertilizers and soil conditioners (Code 26 chapters 200 and 200A) and pesticides (Code chapter 206); 27 animal health, and specifically the control of infectious or 28 contagious diseases afflicting animals (Code chapter 163), the 29 practice of veterinary medicine (Code chapter 169), and the 30 court-ordered management of livestock in immediate need of 31 sustenance (Code chapter 717); and agricultural processing, and 32 specifically the slaughter and processing of meat and poultry 33 products (Code chapter 189A). 34 CROP PRODUCTION ââ APPLICATION OF NUTRIENTS ââ BACKGROUND. 35 -32- LSB 2803SZ (2) 91 da/ns 32/ 38 S.F. 632 The department of agriculture and land stewardship (DALS) 1 regulates the composition of soil inputs, including nutrients 2 such as fertilizers which are manufactured to achieve optimum 3 plant growth under the Iowa fertilizer law (Code section 4 200.1), which includes a number of definitions (Code section 5 200.3). DALS also regulates fertilizing material which is 6 a substance used to compound a fertilizer, and a commercial 7 fertilizer which refers to a fertilizer, fertilizing material, 8 and a fertilizer-pesticide mixture. A secondary input is 9 referred to as a soil conditioner which is a substance other 10 than a fertilizer that improves the condition or structure 11 of the soil and is also used to improve plant growth. DALS 12 licenses persons who manufacture, offer for sale, sell, or 13 distribute a fertilizer or soil conditioner. The person is 14 also subject to a license fee (Code section 200.4). Each brand 15 or grade of commercial fertilizer or soil conditioner must 16 be registered with DALS (Code section 200.5). A fertilizer 17 or soil conditioner is subject to label requirements (Code 18 section 200.6). DALS imposes an inspection fee upon a 19 licensee (Code section 200.8). DALS must sample, inspect, 20 make analysis of, and test a commercial fertilizer or soil 21 conditioner distributed within the state (Code section 200.10). 22 A person is prohibited from manufacturing, offering for sale, 23 or selling a commercial fertilizer or soil conditioner that 24 is injurious to crop growth or deleterious to the soil (Code 25 section 200.11). A person selling a commercial fertilizer 26 or soil conditioner must identify substances promoting 27 its use in a manner that is not deceptive (Code section 28 200.12). DALS must adopt rules regulating equipment used 29 in storing, handling, and transporting fertilizers and soil 30 conditioners (Code section 200.14). DALS is authorized to 31 take administrative action against a licensee or registrant 32 acting in violation of the law, including by canceling the 33 license or registration (Code section 200.15), issuing a stop 34 order (Code section 200.16), or seizing a commercial fertilizer 35 -33- LSB 2803SZ (2) 91 da/ns 33/ 38 S.F. 632 or soil conditioner (Code section 200.17). A county, city, 1 or other political subdivision is prohibited from passing or 2 enforcing local legislation that regulates the use, sale, 3 distribution, storage, transportation, disposal, formulation, 4 labeling, registration, or manufacture of a fertilizer or soil 5 conditioner (Code section 200.22). A person registering a 6 pesticide must account for formulations of a fertilizer (Code 7 section 206.12). A number of Code sections include a reference 8 to soil conditioners: the definition of agricultural land 9 for purposes of eminent domain (Code section 6A.21) and urban 10 renewal (Code section 403.17) each include such a reference. 11 A transportation regulation involving hazardous materials 12 includes soil conditioners (Code section 321.1). A commodity 13 production contract lien (Code section 579B.1) covers the use 14 of a soil conditioner. An exception to the criminal offense 15 of critical infrastructure sabotage includes the use of a soil 16 conditioner (Code section 716.11). 17 CROP PRODUCTION ââ APPLICATION OF NUTRIENTS ââ BILL. The 18 bill replaces the term âsoil conditionerâ with âbeneficial 19 substanceâ, which is defined as a substance or compound that 20 is beneficial to one or more species of plants, soil, or 21 media. âBeneficial substanceâ includes a plant amendment, 22 plant biostimulant, plant inoculant, soil-amending ingredient, 23 soil-amending ingredient form, soil amendment, soil inoculant, 24 and compost. The bill changes references to the state chemist 25 to the bureau chief of the Iowa laboratory bureau (Code 26 sections 190C.22 and 200.10). 27 APPLICATION OF PESTICIDES ââ CERTIFICATION ââ BACKGROUND. 28 DALS is responsible for the administration and enforcement of 29 the âPesticide Act of Iowaâ (Code chapter 206), which in part 30 regulates the use of a pesticide by a commercial applicator, 31 public applicator, or private applicator (Code section 206.2). 32 Generally, a person acting as a commercial applicator or public 33 applicator must be certified to apply any pesticide, and a 34 person acting as a commercial applicator, public applicator, 35 -34- LSB 2803SZ (2) 91 da/ns 34/ 38 S.F. 632 or private applicator (e.g., a farmer) must be certified to 1 apply a restricted use pesticide (Code section 206.5). The 2 designation ârestricted useâ is determined by DALS (Code 3 section 206.20) and is generally based on a pesticide so 4 classified by the United States environmental protection agency 5 (40 C.F.R. Â§152.160 et seq.). DALS is required to administer 6 an educational program in cooperation with the Iowa cooperative 7 extension service in agriculture and home economics of Iowa 8 state university of science and technology. In order to be 9 certified, a person must participate in the educational program 10 by passing an examination for an initial certification and pass 11 an examination or attend instructional hours every three years 12 for the renewal of the certification (Code section 206.5). 13 APPLICATION OF PESTICIDES ââ CERTIFICATION ââ BILL. The 14 bill removes a requirement that DALS adopt by rule criteria 15 allowing a person required to be certified to complete either a 16 written or oral examination. The bill provides that DALS has 17 discretion to adopt such rules. 18 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS OR CONTAGIOUS 19 DISEASES AFFLICTING ANIMALS ââ BACKGROUND. DALS is granted 20 authority to provide for the health of animals and specifically 21 the control of an infectious or contagious disease (disease) 22 afflicting livestock populations (Code chapter 163).

The bill provides that 27 DALS may determine and employ the most efficient and practical 28 means to identify and control a possible, imminent, or actual 29 threat to an animal population caused by a disease. 30 The bill provides that DALS may adopt any necessary rules 31 for the control of an infectious disease affecting animals 32 within the state by emergency rulemaking. When a statute 33 authorizes emergency rulemaking, an agency may adopt a rule 34 immediately without going through the periods of the rulemaking 35 -35- LSB 2803SZ (2) 91 da/ns 35/ 38 S.F. 632 process known as regulatory analysis (Code section 17A.4A) 1 and notice of intended action (Code section 17A.4(3)). The 2 bill requires that such emergency rulemaking be âdouble 3 barreledâ. Under the process known as double-barreled 4 rulemaking, when an agency files an emergency rule, it also 5 files the same rule as a notice of intended action that will 6 follow the regular rulemaking process. Normally, a rule 7 cannot be effective prior to 35 days after its filing with the 8 administrative rules coordinator and publication in the Iowa 9 administrative bulletin. Under emergency rulemaking, a rule 10 can be made effective on the date of filing and acceptance 11 by the administrative rules coordinator or any subsequent 12 date, as specified by the agency in the filing (Code section 13 17A.5(2)(b)(1)). 14 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ PRACTICE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE ââ 15 BACKGROUND.

The attorney general may initiate a claim to 34 collect a civil penalty and any amount collected must be 35 -36- LSB 2803SZ (2) 91 da/ns 36/ 38 S.F. 632 deposited in the general fund of the state. 1 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ COURT-ORDERED MANAGEMENT OF LIVESTOCK 2 IN IMMEDIATE NEED OF SUSTENANCE ââ BACKGROUND. DALS is 3 granted the authority to petition a court to conduct a hearing 4 regarding the condition of livestock. If the court determines 5 that the livestock are in immediate need of sustenance, it 6 must issue an order directing DALS to assume supervision of 7 the livestock (Code section 717.3). The order creates a 8 super-priority lien attached to the livestock, proceeds from 9 the sale of livestock, and any associated unmanufactured 10 products, for the benefit of DALS. DALS may also petition 11 a court to order the disposition of the specified livestock. 12 The proceeds from the sale of the livestock are to be used to 13 reimburse DALS according to the lienâs super-priority status. 14 DALS may also utilize moneys deposited in the livestock 15 remediation fund (remediation fund) (Code section 459.501) 16 to pay for costs of providing for sustenance to livestock as 17 provided in the court order (Code section 717.4A). 18 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ COURT-ORDERED MANAGEMENT OF LIVESTOCK 19 IN IMMEDIATE NEED OF SUSTENANCE ââ BILL. The bill rewrites 20 a provision requiring DALS to repay the remediation fund 21 any proceeds that DALS receives from the disposition of the 22 livestock less expenses in providing for the sustenance and 23 disposition. The bill provides that if the court orders the 24 disposition of the livestock, the order shall be deemed as 25 acting in response to a petition by a receiver appointed by a 26 court in Code chapter 680. 27 AGRICULTURAL PROCESSING ââ SLAUGHTER AND PROCESSING OF MEAT 28 AND POULTRY PRODUCTS ââ LICENSURE ââ BILL. The bill provides 29 that a home food processing establishment licensed by the 30 department of inspections, appeals, and licensing is exempt 31 from DALS licensing requirements (Code chapter 137D). A home 32 food processing establishment refers to a residence in which 33 homemade food items are produced for sale, if consumption is 34 off premises and its business has gross annual sales of less 35 -37- LSB 2803SZ (2) 91 da/ns 37/ 38 S.F. 632 than $50,000 (Code section 137D.1).
