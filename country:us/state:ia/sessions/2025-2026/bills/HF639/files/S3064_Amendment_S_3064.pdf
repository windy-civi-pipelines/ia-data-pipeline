11 to be taxed by the court, unless on the trial of the appeal the
12 same or a lesser amount of damages is awarded than was allowed
13 by the compensation commission from which the appeal was taken.
14 7. As used in this section, “damages” means compensation
15 for damages to the land, crops, and other personal property
16 caused by the construction activity of installing an
17 electric transmission line and its attendant structures, or a
18 compensable loss as described in section 478.35, subsection 1,
