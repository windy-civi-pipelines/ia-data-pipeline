8 Sec. 6. NEW SECTION. 476A.17 Drainage tile —— liability.
9 For an applicant exercising the power of eminent domain
10 pursuant to this chapter, the operator of the electric power
11 generation and transmission facility shall be liable for
12 repairs of drainage tile installed prior to the installation of
13 the facility, when the installation, construction, operation,

28 section shall implement the following requirements, which shall
29 not apply within the corporate limits of a city, to any land
30 owned by the facility owner, or to any construction, activity,
31 or facility other than a facility as defined in this chapter:
32 a. A facility owner shall repair a damaged underground
33 drain tile as soon as practicable during construction of the
34 facility. Permanent repairs to the damaged underground drain
35 tile shall be completed as soon as practicable after the
S 3064.1983 (2) 91
-3- sb/js 3/29

1 initial construction of the facility is complete. The repairs
2 made to the damaged drain tile shall be of at least equal
3 quality, size, and flow capacity of the original drain tile.
4 b. Following the construction of the facility, the facility
5 owner shall remove from any easement area all rock larger than
6 three inches in average diameter not native to the soil of the
7 excavated land. The rock removed from the excavated land that
8 cannot be used to backfill shall be disposed of at a location
9 and in a manner agreed upon by the facility owner and the
10 landowner.
11 c. Upon completion of construction activities on a property,
12 the facility owner shall deep till agricultural land, including
13 right-of-way access points or roads traversed by heavy
14 construction equipment, to alleviate soil compaction. The land
15 shall be tilled at least eighteen inches deep in land used for
16 crop production and twelve inches deep in other lands unless
17 otherwise agreed to by the landowner.
18 d. Upon completion of the facility, the facility owner shall
19 restore the soil conservation practices and structures damaged
20 during construction of the facility to the elevation and grade
21 existing on the land prior to the construction. The soil used
22 to repair embankments intended to retain water shall be well
23 compacted. Any vegetation disturbed during construction shall
24 be reestablished, including cover crops when appropriate.
25 e. Following compaction of the land, agricultural land that
26 is not in row crop or small grain production at the time of
27 construction, including hay ground and land in conservation or
28 set-aside programs, shall be reseeded and a cover crop shall
29 be utilized when appropriate. Seeding for cover crops may be
30 delayed if the construction of the facility is completed too
31 late in the year for a cover crop to become established and is
32 not required if the land will be tilled in the following year.
33 The landowner may request ground cover to prevent soil erosion
34 in areas where construction on the facility is completed if the
35 season is not suitable for seeding a cover crop.
S 3064.1983 (2) 91
-4- sb/js 4/29

1 f. Unless agreed upon by the facility owner and the
2 landowner, the facility owner shall remove field entrances
3 or temporary roads built for the purpose of constructing the
4 facility upon the completion of construction and restore the
5 area to its previous use.
6 g. A facility owner shall use good utility practices for
7 constructing the facility in wet conditions, such as electing
8 to use matting or padding when utilizing heavy equipment. A
9 facility owner shall grade and till any rutted land to restore,
10 to the extent practicable, the original condition of the land
11 prior to the construction of the facility. If agreed upon by
12 the facility owner and the landowner, the landowner may repair
13 any damage caused by construction activities in wet conditions
14 and the facility owner shall reimburse the landowner for the
15 reasonable cost incurred to repair the damage. If a facility
16 owner utilizes heavy equipment in wetlands or mudflats, mats or
17 other measures shall be utilized to minimize soil disturbance.
18 h. The facility owner shall designate a point of contact for
19 inquiries or claims from an affected person. The designation
20 shall include a name, a telephone number, an email address, and
21 an address.
22 2. a. If a facility owner and a landowner dispute a
23 potential violation of the restoration standards provided in
24 subsection 1, the commission may appoint a qualified individual
25 to inspect the property for compliance. If the qualified
26 individual determines that there has been a violation of the
27 applicable restoration standards, the commission shall provide
28 oral notice, followed by written notice, to the facility owner
29 and the contractor operating for the facility owner and order
30 corrective action to comply with the restoration standards.
31 The facility owner shall be responsible for the costs of the
32 corrective action.
33 b. If the facility owner or the contractor for the facility
34 owner does not comply with a valid order for corrective
35 action issued by the commission, the commission may issue an
S 3064.1983 (2) 91
-5- sb/js 5/29

1 order requiring corrective action to be taken and may impose
2 civil penalties under section 478.29, which shall apply to a
3 violation of this section in lieu of section 476A.14.
4 c. The commission shall instruct the inspector appointed by
5 the commission regarding the content of the statutes and rules
6 and the responsibility of the inspector to require restoration
7 conforming with the standards established in subsection 1.
8 3. a. An applicant for a certificate shall file with the
9 application a written land restoration plan that documents how
10 the requirements and rules of subsection 1 will be met. The
11 applicant shall provide a copy of the plan to all landowners
12 of property that will be disturbed by the construction of the
13 facility.
14 b. Nothing in this section shall preclude the application
15 of provisions for protecting or restoring property that are
16 different than those prescribed in subsection 1, in rules
17 adopted under subsection 1, or in the land restoration plan,
18 if the alternative provisions are contained in agreements
19 independently executed by the facility owner and the landowner.
20 Independent agreements for land restoration between the
21 facility owner and the landowner shall be in writing and made
22 available to the commission upon request.
23 c. The commission may by waiver allow variations from the
24 requirements of subsection 1 if the facility owner requesting a
25 waiver satisfies the standards set forth in section 17A.9A and
26 if the alternative methods proposed by the facility owner would
27 restore the land to a condition as good as or better than as
28 provided for in subsection 1.
29 d. The commission may waive preparation of a separate
30 land restoration plan if the facility owner enters into an
31 agricultural impact mitigation plan or similar agreement
32 with the appropriate agencies of this state that satisfies
33 the requirements of subsection 1. If a mitigation plan or
34 agreement is used to fully or partially meet the requirements
35 of a land restoration plan, the statement or agreement shall
S 3064.1983 (2) 91
-6- sb/js 6/29

1 be filed with the commission and shall be considered to be,
2 or to be part of, the land restoration plan for purposes of
3 subsection 1.
4 4. Nothing in this section shall limit, expand, or otherwise
5 modify the rights of access and obligations for damages set
6 forth in section 476A.16.
7 5. The requirements of this section shall apply only to
8 facility construction projects commenced on or after June 1,
9 2025.

11 individual, company, or corporation operating the facility.
12 2. A claim for damages pursuant to this section shall not be
13 precluded from renegotiation under section 6B.52 on the grounds
14 that the damages were apparent at the time of settlement unless
15 the settlement expressly releases the individual, company,
16 or corporation operating the facility from the claim. The
17 landowner shall notify the individual, company, or corporation
18 in writing fourteen days prior to harvest in each year to
19 assess crop deficiency.
20 3. A landowner that incurred damage under this section
21 is eligible for compensation for damages. A landowner may

10 notice by publication was properly made, a person seeking
11 rights under this chapter and a landowner may enter a voluntary
12 agreement for an interest in land without regard to whether
13 the landowner received notice by mail. Prior to entering a
14 voluntary agreement with a landowner who did not receive notice
15 of the informational meeting by mail, the person seeking rights
16 under this chapter shall provide such landowner copies of the
17 informational meeting materials presented by the commission,
18 the consumer advocate, and the person seeking rights under

35 will extend, to be published in a newspaper located in each
S 3064.1983 (2) 91
-9- sb/js 9/29

1 such county for two consecutive weeks. Said notice shall
2 contain a general statement of the contents and purpose of the
3 petition, a general description of the lands and highways to
4 be traversed by the proposed line or lines, and shall state

12 of last publication and shall state the grounds therefor. The
13 commission may allow objections to be filed later in which
14 event the applicant must be given reasonable time to meet
15 respond to such late objections.
16 2. If a route is readjusted due to an objection filed

20 section 478.2.
21 Sec. 12. Section 478.6, Code 2025, is amended by adding the
22 following new subsection:

28 follows:
29 478.17 Access to lines —— damages.
30 1. Individuals or corporations operating transmission lines
31 shall have reasonable access to the transmission lines for the
32 purpose of constructing, reconstructing, enlarging, repairing,
33 or locating the poles, wires, or construction and other devices
34 used in or upon any line, but shall pay to the owner of the
35 lands and of crops on the lands all damages to the lands or
S 3064.1983 (2) 91
-10- sb/js 10/29

1 crops caused by entering, using, and occupying the lands for
2 those purposes. This section shall not prevent the execution
3 of an agreement between the person, or company, or corporation
4 owning or operating the lines and the owner of the land or
5 crops regarding the use of the land.
6 2. A claim for damages pursuant to this section due to crop
7 yield loss shall not be precluded from renegotiation under
8 section 6B.52 on the grounds that the damages were apparent at
9 the time of settlement unless the settlement expressly releases
10 the person, company, or corporation owning or operating the
11 lines from claims for damages to the productivity of the soil.
12 A landowner that seeks damages under this section not subject
13 to a release shall notify the person, company, or corporation

18 pursuant to this chapter, an electric transmission owner
19 as defined in section 478.16 shall be liable for repairs
20 of drainage tile installed prior to the installation of
21 the electric transmission line, when the installation,
22 construction, operation, maintenance, or repair of the electric
23 transmission line is the proximate cause of the damage to
24 the drainage tile. The operator’s liability pursuant to
25 this section shall continue for the life of the electric
26 transmission line and shall include all of the following:
27 1. The full replacement costs of the drainage tile,
28 including, without limitation, material, labor, and equipment.
29 2. The reclamation and restoration of topsoil as part of any
30 drainage tile repair.
31 Sec. 15. Section 478.29, subsection 1, Code 2025, is amended
32 to read as follows:

9 Sec. 16. NEW SECTION. 478.34 Land restoration standards.
10 1. The commission shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
11 17A regarding the restoration of agricultural lands following
12 construction of an electric transmission line subject to
13 this chapter that is capable of operating at two hundred
14 kilovolts or greater. Rules adopted under this section shall
15 implement the following requirements, which shall not apply
16 within the corporate limits of a city, to property excluded
17 from a franchise under section 478.1, subsection 2, or to any
18 construction, activity, or facility not subject to a franchise
19 under this chapter:
20 a. An electric transmission owner shall repair a damaged
21 underground drain tile as soon as practicable during
22 construction of the electric transmission line. Permanent
23 repairs to the damaged underground drain tile shall be
24 completed as soon as practicable after the initial construction
25 of the electric transmission line is complete. The repairs
26 made to the damaged drain tile shall be of at least equal
27 quality, size, and flow capacity of the original drain tile.
28 b. Following the construction of an electric transmission
29 line, the electric transmission owner shall remove from the
30 easement area all rock larger than three inches in average
31 diameter not native to the soil of the excavated land. The
32 rock removed from the excavated land that cannot be used to
33 backfill shall be disposed of at a location and in a manner
34 agreed upon by the electric transmission owner and the
35 landowner.

1 c. Upon completion of construction activities on a property,
2 the electric transmission owner shall deep till agricultural
3 land, including right-of-way access points or roads traversed
4 by heavy construction equipment, to alleviate soil compaction.
5 The land shall be tilled at least eighteen inches deep in land
6 used for crop production and twelve inches deep in other lands
7 unless otherwise agreed to by the landowner.
8 d. Upon completion of the electric transmission line, the
9 electric transmission owner shall restore the soil conservation
10 practices and structures damaged during construction of the
11 electric transmission line to the elevation and grade existing
12 on the land prior to the construction. The soil used to
13 repair embankments intended to retain water shall be well
14 compacted. Any vegetation disturbed during construction shall
15 be reestablished, including cover crops when appropriate.
16 e. Following compaction of the land, agricultural land that
17 is not in row crop or small grain production at the time of
18 construction, including hay ground and land in conservation or
19 set-aside programs, shall be reseeded and a cover crop shall
20 be utilized when appropriate. Seeding for cover crops may be
21 delayed if the construction of the electric transmission line
22 is completed too late in the year for a cover crop to become
23 established and is not required if the land will be tilled in
24 the following year. The landowner may request ground cover
25 to prevent soil erosion in areas where construction on the
26 electric transmission line is completed if the season is not
27 suitable for seeding a cover crop.
28 f. Unless agreed upon by the electric transmission owner
29 and the landowner, the electric transmission owner shall remove
30 field entrances or temporary roads built for the purpose of
31 constructing the electric transmission line upon the completion
32 of construction and restore the area to its previous use.
33 g. An electric transmission owner shall use good utility
34 practices for constructing the electric transmission line in
35 wet conditions, such as electing to use matting or padding when
S 3064.1983 (2) 91
-13- sb/js 13/29

1 utilizing heavy equipment. An electric transmission owner
2 shall grade and till any rutted land to restore, to the extent
3 practicable, the original condition of the land prior to the
4 construction of the electric transmission line. If agreed
5 upon by the electric transmission owner and the landowner,
6 the landowner may repair any damage caused by construction
7 activities in wet conditions and the electric transmission
8 owner shall reimburse the landowner for the reasonable cost
9 incurred to repair the damage. If an electric transmission
10 owner utilizes heavy equipment in wetlands or mudflats, mats or
11 other measures shall be utilized to minimize soil disturbance.
12 h. The electric transmission owner shall designate a point
13 of contact for inquiries or claims from an affected person.
14 The designation shall include a name, a telephone number, an
15 email address, and an address.
16 2. a. If an electric transmission owner and a landowner
17 dispute a potential violation of the restoration standards
18 provided in subsection 1, the commission may appoint a
19 qualified individual to inspect the property for compliance.
20 If the qualified individual determines that there has been
21 a violation of the applicable restoration standards, the
22 commission shall provide oral notice, followed by written
23 notice, to the electric transmission owner and the contractor
24 operating for the electric transmission owner and order
25 corrective action to comply with the restoration standards.
26 The electric transmission owner shall be responsible for the
27 costs of the corrective action.
28 b. If the electric transmission owner or the contractor
29 for the electric transmission owner does not comply with a
30 valid order for corrective action issued by the commission, the
31 commission may issue an order requiring corrective action to be
32 taken and may impose civil penalties under section 478.29.
33 c. The commission shall instruct the inspector appointed by
34 the commission regarding the content of the statutes and rules
35 and the responsibility of the inspector to require restoration

1 conforming with the standards established in subsection 1.
2 3. a. A petitioner for a franchise for an electric
3 transmission line shall file with the petition a written land
4 restoration plan that documents how the requirements and rules
5 of subsection 1 will be met. The petitioner shall provide a
6 copy of the plan to all landowners of property that will be
7 disturbed by the construction of the electric transmission
8 line.
9 b. Nothing in this section shall preclude the application
10 of provisions for protecting or restoring property that are
11 different than those prescribed in subsection 1, in rules
12 adopted under subsection 1, or in the land restoration plan,
13 if the alternative provisions are contained in agreements
14 independently executed by the electric transmission owner and
15 the landowner. Independent agreements for land restoration
16 between the electric transmission owner and the landowner shall
17 be in writing and shall be made available to the commission
18 upon request.
19 c. The commission may by waiver allow variations from the
20 requirements of subsection 1 if the electric transmission
21 owner requesting a waiver satisfies the standards set forth
22 in section 17A.9A and if the alternative methods proposed
23 by the electric transmission owner would restore the land
24 to a condition as good as or better than as provided for in
25 subsection 1.
26 d. The commission may waive preparation of a separate land
27 restoration plan if the electric transmission owner enters into
28 an agricultural impact mitigation plan or similar agreement
29 with the appropriate agencies of this state that satisfies
30 the requirements of subsection 1. If a mitigation plan or
31 agreement is used to fully or partially meet the requirements
32 of a land restoration plan, the statement or agreement shall
33 be filed with the commission and shall be considered to be,
34 or to be part of, the land restoration plan for purposes of
35 subsection 1.

3 Sec. 43. Section 479B.29, subsection 2, Code 2025, is
4 amended to read as follows:
5 2. A claim for damage for future crop deficiency within
6 the easement strip damages incurred under this section shall
7 not be precluded from renegotiation under section 6B.52 on
8 the grounds that it was apparent at the time of settlement

10 from claims for damage to the productivity of the soil. The A
11 landowner that seeks damages under this section not subject to
12 a release shall notify the pipeline company in writing fourteen
13 days prior to harvest in each year to assess crop deficiency.
