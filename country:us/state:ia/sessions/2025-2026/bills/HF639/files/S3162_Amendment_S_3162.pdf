9 to use matting or padding when utilizing heavy equipment. A
10 facility owner shall grade and till any rutted land to restore,
11 to the extent practicable, the original condition of the land
12 prior to the construction of the facility. If agreed upon by
13 the facility owner and the landowner, the landowner may repair
14 any damage caused by construction activities in wet conditions
15 and the facility owner shall reimburse the landowner for the
16 reasonable cost incurred to repair the damage. If a facility
17 owner utilizes heavy equipment in wetlands or mudflats, mats or
18 other measures shall be utilized to minimize soil disturbance.
19 h. The facility owner shall designate a point of contact for
20 inquiries or claims from an affected person. The designation
21 shall include a name, a telephone number, an email address, and

26 to inspect the property for compliance. If the qualified
27 individual determines that there has been a violation of the
28 applicable restoration standards, the commission shall provide
29 oral notice, followed by written notice, to the facility owner
30 and the contractor operating for the facility owner and order
31 corrective action to comply with the restoration standards.
32 The facility owner shall be responsible for the costs of the
33 corrective action.
34 b. If the facility owner or the contractor for the facility
35 owner does not comply with a valid order for corrective
S 3064.1973 (1) 91

3 civil penalties under section 478.29, which shall apply to a
4 violation of this section in lieu of section 476A.14.
5 c. The commission shall instruct the inspector appointed by
6 the commission regarding the content of the statutes and rules
7 and the responsibility of the inspector to require restoration
8 conforming with the standards established in subsection 1.
9 3. a. An applicant for a certificate shall file with the
10 application a written land restoration plan that documents how
11 the requirements and rules of subsection 1 will be met. The
12 applicant shall provide a copy of the plan to all landowners
13 of property that will be disturbed by the construction of the
14 facility.
15 b. Nothing in this section shall preclude the application
16 of provisions for protecting or restoring property that are
17 different than those prescribed in subsection 1, in rules
18 adopted under subsection 1, or in the land restoration plan,
19 if the alternative provisions are contained in agreements
20 independently executed by the facility owner and the landowner.
21 Independent agreements for land restoration between the
22 facility owner and the landowner shall be in writing and made
23 available to the commission upon request.
24 c. The commission may by waiver allow variations from the
25 requirements of subsection 1 if the facility owner requesting a
26 waiver satisfies the standards set forth in section 17A.9A and
27 if the alternative methods proposed by the facility owner would
28 restore the land to a condition as good as or better than as
29 provided for in subsection 1.
30 d. The commission may waive preparation of a separate
31 land restoration plan if the facility owner enters into an
32 agricultural impact mitigation plan or similar agreement
33 with the appropriate agencies of this state that satisfies
34 the requirements of subsection 1. If a mitigation plan or
35 agreement is used to fully or partially meet the requirements
S 3064.1973 (1) 91
