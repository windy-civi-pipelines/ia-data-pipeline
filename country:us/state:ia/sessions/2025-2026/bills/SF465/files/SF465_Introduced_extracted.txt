Section 16.64, subsection 1, Code 2025, is amended 34 to read as follows: 35 -15- LSB 1410SV (1) 91 nls/ko 15/ 21 S.F. 465 1. The authority shall publish a notice of intention to 1 issue bonds or notes. After sixty days from the date of 2 publication of the notice, an action shall not be brought 3 questioning the legality of any bonds or notes or the power of 4 the authority to issue any bonds or notes or to the legality 5 of any proceedings in connection with the authorization or 6 issuance of the bonds or notes after determination by the board 7 of the authority to proceed with the issuance of the bonds or 8 notes. 9 EXPLANATION 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 11 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 12 This bill relates to matters under the purview of the 13 economic development authority and the Iowa finance authority 14 including the strategic infrastructure program, brownfield, 15 grayfield, and redevelopment tax credits, community attraction 16 and tourism, vision Iowa, sports tourism marketing, the 17 historic preservation tax credit, homelessness, the title 18 guaranty board, and arts and culture. 19 Division I eliminates the requirement that the Iowa 20 innovation council review and make recommendations on all 21 applications received by the Iowa economic development 22 authority (IEDA) for financial assistance under the Iowa 23 strategic infrastructure program, and instead requires a 24 committee appointed by the IEDA director to conduct a review 25 and make recommendations. 26 Division II repeals the brownfield redevelopment program, 27 fund, and advisory council (council). 28 The bill requires that the amount of a redevelopment tax 29 credit be determined by members of the IEDA appointed by the 30 governor (the board), rather than determined by the board 31 in conjunction with the council as required under current 32 law. The IEDA shall accept and review applications for the 33 redevelopment tax credit and make award recommendations to 34 the board, rather than accept and review applications in 35 -16- LSB 1410SV (1) 91 nls/ko 16/ 21 S.F. 465 conjunction with the council as required under current law. 1 IEDA may engage outside experts to complete a technical, 2 financial, or other review. The bill makes conforming changes 3 related to elimination of the council. 4 Under current law, upon completion of a registered project 5 for redevelopment tax credits, an audit of the project 6 completed by an independent certified public accountant (CPA) 7 shall be submitted to the IEDA. Under the bill, the investor 8 shall engage a CPA to conduct an examination of the project 9 and submit the examination, and a statement of the amount of 10 final qualifying investments, to the IEDA. Upon review of the 11 examination and statement, the IEDA may issue a tax credit 12 certificate to the investor. 13 On the effective date of the bill, all unencumbered and 14 unobligated moneys remaining in the brownfield redevelopment 15 fund are transferred to a fund or funds established pursuant to 16 Code section 15.335B, as determined by the IEDA. 17 Division III eliminates the requirement that an applicant 18 awarded financial assistance under both the vision Iowa program 19 and the community attraction and tourism program provide and 20 pay at least 50 percent of the cost of a standard medical 21 insurance plan for all full-time employees after the completion 22 of the project for which financial assistance was received. 23 This division applies to applicants awarded financial 24 assistance under both programs on or after the effective date 25 of the bill, and applies retroactively to applicants awarded 26 financial assistance under both programs prior to the effective 27 date of the bill. 28 Under division IV, the director of the IEDA shall appoint a 29 review committee composed of members with relevant expertise to 30 review community attraction and tourism program applications 31 and sports tourism marketing and infrastructure program 32 applications. Under current law, the review committee is 33 composed of five members of the IEDA board. 34 Division V requires, in addition to existing requirements 35 -17- LSB 1410SV (1) 91 nls/ko 17/ 21 S.F. 465 for the historic preservation tax credit program (historic 1 tax program) under current law, for a project for the 2 rehabilitation of property to be considered a âqualified 3 rehabilitation projectâ (project), that the property not be a 4 single-family dwelling unit, unless the project will result 5 in two or more new single-family dwelling units that were 6 not available for occupancy for at least six months prior to 7 the project, and the dwelling units are located in the same 8 neighborhood as confirmed by the IEDA. The single-family 9 dwelling units must be made available for occupancy as a result 10 of the project. The IEDA may promulgate rules that specify the 11 criteria used to determine if a property is a single-family 12 dwelling unit, and to determine if a property is a qualified 13 rehabilitation project. 14 Under current law, upon successful registration of a 15 project under the historic tax program, the eligible taxpayer 16 (taxpayer) shall enter into an agreement with the IEDA that 17 contains mutually agreeable terms and conditions including the 18 commencement date of the project, which shall not be later than 19 the end of the fiscal year in which the agreement is entered 20 into, and the completion date of the project, which shall be 21 within 36 months of the commencement date. Under the bill, 22 the date by which the project must commence shall be no later 23 than one calendar year from the registration date, except 24 that upon application of the taxpayer the IEDA may extend the 25 date of commencement up to 12 additional months. The date by 26 which the project must be completed shall be no later than 27 three consecutive calendar years from the registration date, 28 except that upon application of the taxpayer, the IEDA may 29 extend the date of commencement up to another 12 months. The 30 project is complete as of the date the property is placed in 31 service. Upon application of the taxpayer made prior to the 32 expiration of the 12-month extension, the IEDA may extend the 33 date by which the project must be completed up to an additional 34 12 months. The taxpayer must substantiate that the requested 35 -18- LSB 1410SV (1) 91 nls/ko 18/ 21 S.F. 465 extension is warranted due to extenuating circumstances. 1 Under the bill, the IEDA may grant historic preservation 2 tax credits beyond the aggregate tax credit award limit in one 3 fiscal year if, during that fiscal year, the IEDA receives an 4 application for a project that has qualified rehabilitation 5 expenditures that, if registered, would make the taxpayer 6 eligible for tax credits of $10 million or more. The IEDA is 7 then permitted to award tax credits during that fiscal year not 8 to exceed 20 percent more than the maximum aggregate tax credit 9 award limit. Such tax credits awarded shall be considered for 10 purposes of calculating the maximum aggregate tax credit award 11 limit in the immediately succeeding fiscal year. 12 Under division VI, the Iowa finance authority (IFA) 13 may adopt rules to carry out the duties of IFA related to 14 homelessness, and may establish internal rules of procedure, 15 consistent with the requirements of the federal McKinney-Vento 16 Homeless Assistance Act. Under current law, IFA must adopt 17 rules. 18 Division VII eliminates the title guaranty division board. 19 The powers of the title guaranty division relating to the 20 issuance of title guaranties are vested in the IFA board of 21 directors. The director of the IFA shall appoint an attorney 22 as director of the division, and the division directorâs 23 appointment and compensation shall be exempt from the merit 24 system. The bill makes conforming changes to Code sections 25 16.1A, 16.91, 16.92, and 16.93. 26 Division VIII is related to arts and culture. Under current 27 law, the IEDA is responsible for the Iowa cultural trust, 28 including the issuance of trust fund credits for the promotion 29 of the arts, history, or the sciences and humanities; the 30 issuance of grants for qualified organizations; developing and 31 implementing fee-based educational programming opportunities; 32 conducting surveys of existing art and cultural programs 33 and activities within the state; and the establishment and 34 administration of a film office. The bill maintains the 35 -19- LSB 1410SV (1) 91 nls/ko 19/ 21 S.F. 465 responsibility for the IEDA to accept, receive, and administer 1 grants or other funds or gifts from public or private agencies; 2 to design and carry out a comprehensive, statewide, long-range 3 plan (plan) with the assistance of the Iowa arts council to 4 develop the arts in Iowa; and to establish advisory groups for 5 the receipt of federal funds or grants or the administration 6 of the IEDAâs programs. Under the bill, the IEDA is no longer 7 required to establish and administer a film office. Instead, 8 the IEDA is responsible for providing technical assistance for 9 the production of film, television, and video projects in the 10 state. 11 The bill eliminates certified cultural and entertainment 12 districts. The bill eliminates the cultural grant programs 13 under current law, which requires the IEDA to establish 14 a grant program for cities and nonprofit, tax-exempt 15 community organizations for the development of community 16 programs that provide local jobs for Iowa residents and 17 promote Iowaâs historic, ethnic, and cultural heritages 18 through the development of festivals, music, drama, cultural 19 programs, or tourist attractions. Additionally, the IEDA 20 is required to establish a grant program which provides 21 general operating budget support to major, multidisciplinary 22 cultural organizations that demonstrate cultural and managerial 23 excellence on a continuing basis to the citizens of Iowa. 24 Instead, the bill creates the arts and culture enhancement 25 fund (enhancement fund), under which the IEDA shall allocate 26 moneys to the fund to provide support to municipal and 27 nonprofit arts and cultural organizations that serve as 28 significant attractions or community resources; to support 29 artists and entities that foster artistic and cultural 30 expression, promote lifelong learning and engagement in the 31 arts, advance community development goals, or emphasize Iowaâs 32 diverse heritage through artwork; to increase access to arts 33 and culture in rural and underserved communities; for the 34 promotion of and investment in film, television, and video 35 -20- LSB 1410SV (1) 91 nls/ko 20/ 21 S.F. 465 projects produced in the state; and to address other goals and 1 priorities in the plan designed by the IEDA. The enhancement 2 fund consists of moneys appropriated by the general assembly 3 and any other moneys that are lawfully available to the IEDA. 4 Each fiscal year, $520,000 is appropriated from gambling 5 and sports wagering taxes to the IEDA for deposit in the 6 enhancement fund. The IEDA may establish and adopt by rule 7 eligibility and priority criteria for allocation of moneys in 8 the enhancement fund. 9 The Iowa arts council (arts council) may elect a chairperson 10 and vice chairperson from the members of the arts council, 11 rather than being designated by the governor under current law. 12 In addition to duties under current law, the arts council is 13 required to recommend programs to ensure that Iowa citizens and 14 communities have access to the cultural, civic, economic, and 15 educational benefits of the arts. 16 The bill repeals Code sections 15.437 through 15.441, 15.476 17 through 15.479, 15.481, and 15.482, eliminating the Iowa 18 cultural trust Act, including the Iowa cultural trust, trust 19 fund, grant account, and board of trustees, and eliminates the 20 arts and cultural conferences and caucuses, the cultural and 21 entertainment districts, the Iowa great places program and 22 fund, and the culture, history, and arts teams program. 23 On the effective date of this division of the bill, all 24 unencumbered and unobligated moneys remaining in the Iowa 25 great places program fund, Iowa cultural trust fund, and Iowa 26 cultural trust grant account are transferred to the arts and 27 culture enhancement fund established in the bill. 28 Division IX makes conforming changes to Code sections 16.6 29 and 16.64. 30 -21- LSB 1410SV (1) 91 nls/ko 21/ 21

Section 16.6, subsection 4, Code 2025, is amended 26 to read as follows: 27 4.

Section 16.64, subsection 1, Code 2025, is amended 34 to read as follows: 35 -15- LSB 1410SV (1) 91 nls/ko 15/ 21 S.F. 465 1. The authority shall publish a notice of intention to 1 issue bonds or notes. After sixty days from the date of 2 publication of the notice, an action shall not be brought 3 questioning the legality of any bonds or notes or the power of 4 the authority to issue any bonds or notes or to the legality 5 of any proceedings in connection with the authorization or 6 issuance of the bonds or notes after determination by the board 7 of the authority to proceed with the issuance of the bonds or 8 notes. 9 EXPLANATION 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 11 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 12 This bill relates to matters under the purview of the 13 economic development authority and the Iowa finance authority 14 including the strategic infrastructure program, brownfield, 15 grayfield, and redevelopment tax credits, community attraction 16 and tourism, vision Iowa, sports tourism marketing, the 17 historic preservation tax credit, homelessness, the title 18 guaranty board, and arts and culture. 19 Division I eliminates the requirement that the Iowa 20 innovation council review and make recommendations on all 21 applications received by the Iowa economic development 22 authority (IEDA) for financial assistance under the Iowa 23 strategic infrastructure program, and instead requires a 24 committee appointed by the IEDA director to conduct a review 25 and make recommendations. 26 Division II repeals the brownfield redevelopment program, 27 fund, and advisory council (council). 28 The bill requires that the amount of a redevelopment tax 29 credit be determined by members of the IEDA appointed by the 30 governor (the board), rather than determined by the board 31 in conjunction with the council as required under current 32 law. The IEDA shall accept and review applications for the 33 redevelopment tax credit and make award recommendations to 34 the board, rather than accept and review applications in 35 -16- LSB 1410SV (1) 91 nls/ko 16/ 21 S.F. 465 conjunction with the council as required under current law. 1 IEDA may engage outside experts to complete a technical, 2 financial, or other review. The bill makes conforming changes 3 related to elimination of the council. 4 Under current law, upon completion of a registered project 5 for redevelopment tax credits, an audit of the project 6 completed by an independent certified public accountant (CPA) 7 shall be submitted to the IEDA. Under the bill, the investor 8 shall engage a CPA to conduct an examination of the project 9 and submit the examination, and a statement of the amount of 10 final qualifying investments, to the IEDA. Upon review of the 11 examination and statement, the IEDA may issue a tax credit 12 certificate to the investor. 13 On the effective date of the bill, all unencumbered and 14 unobligated moneys remaining in the brownfield redevelopment 15 fund are transferred to a fund or funds established pursuant to 16 Code section 15.335B, as determined by the IEDA. 17 Division III eliminates the requirement that an applicant 18 awarded financial assistance under both the vision Iowa program 19 and the community attraction and tourism program provide and 20 pay at least 50 percent of the cost of a standard medical 21 insurance plan for all full-time employees after the completion 22 of the project for which financial assistance was received. 23 This division applies to applicants awarded financial 24 assistance under both programs on or after the effective date 25 of the bill, and applies retroactively to applicants awarded 26 financial assistance under both programs prior to the effective 27 date of the bill. 28 Under division IV, the director of the IEDA shall appoint a 29 review committee composed of members with relevant expertise to 30 review community attraction and tourism program applications 31 and sports tourism marketing and infrastructure program 32 applications. Under current law, the review committee is 33 composed of five members of the IEDA board. 34 Division V requires, in addition to existing requirements 35 -17- LSB 1410SV (1) 91 nls/ko 17/ 21 S.F. 465 for the historic preservation tax credit program (historic 1 tax program) under current law, for a project for the 2 rehabilitation of property to be considered a âqualified 3 rehabilitation projectâ (project), that the property not be a 4 single-family dwelling unit, unless the project will result 5 in two or more new single-family dwelling units that were 6 not available for occupancy for at least six months prior to 7 the project, and the dwelling units are located in the same 8 neighborhood as confirmed by the IEDA. The single-family 9 dwelling units must be made available for occupancy as a result 10 of the project. The IEDA may promulgate rules that specify the 11 criteria used to determine if a property is a single-family 12 dwelling unit, and to determine if a property is a qualified 13 rehabilitation project. 14 Under current law, upon successful registration of a 15 project under the historic tax program, the eligible taxpayer 16 (taxpayer) shall enter into an agreement with the IEDA that 17 contains mutually agreeable terms and conditions including the 18 commencement date of the project, which shall not be later than 19 the end of the fiscal year in which the agreement is entered 20 into, and the completion date of the project, which shall be 21 within 36 months of the commencement date. Under the bill, 22 the date by which the project must commence shall be no later 23 than one calendar year from the registration date, except 24 that upon application of the taxpayer the IEDA may extend the 25 date of commencement up to 12 additional months. The date by 26 which the project must be completed shall be no later than 27 three consecutive calendar years from the registration date, 28 except that upon application of the taxpayer, the IEDA may 29 extend the date of commencement up to another 12 months. The 30 project is complete as of the date the property is placed in 31 service. Upon application of the taxpayer made prior to the 32 expiration of the 12-month extension, the IEDA may extend the 33 date by which the project must be completed up to an additional 34 12 months. The taxpayer must substantiate that the requested 35 -18- LSB 1410SV (1) 91 nls/ko 18/ 21 S.F. 465 extension is warranted due to extenuating circumstances. 1 Under the bill, the IEDA may grant historic preservation 2 tax credits beyond the aggregate tax credit award limit in one 3 fiscal year if, during that fiscal year, the IEDA receives an 4 application for a project that has qualified rehabilitation 5 expenditures that, if registered, would make the taxpayer 6 eligible for tax credits of $10 million or more. The IEDA is 7 then permitted to award tax credits during that fiscal year not 8 to exceed 20 percent more than the maximum aggregate tax credit 9 award limit. Such tax credits awarded shall be considered for 10 purposes of calculating the maximum aggregate tax credit award 11 limit in the immediately succeeding fiscal year. 12 Under division VI, the Iowa finance authority (IFA) 13 may adopt rules to carry out the duties of IFA related to 14 homelessness, and may establish internal rules of procedure, 15 consistent with the requirements of the federal McKinney-Vento 16 Homeless Assistance Act. Under current law, IFA must adopt 17 rules. 18 Division VII eliminates the title guaranty division board. 19 The powers of the title guaranty division relating to the 20 issuance of title guaranties are vested in the IFA board of 21 directors. The director of the IFA shall appoint an attorney 22 as director of the division, and the division directorâs 23 appointment and compensation shall be exempt from the merit 24 system. The bill makes conforming changes to Code sections 25 16.1A, 16.91, 16.92, and 16.93. 26 Division VIII is related to arts and culture. Under current 27 law, the IEDA is responsible for the Iowa cultural trust, 28 including the issuance of trust fund credits for the promotion 29 of the arts, history, or the sciences and humanities; the 30 issuance of grants for qualified organizations; developing and 31 implementing fee-based educational programming opportunities; 32 conducting surveys of existing art and cultural programs 33 and activities within the state; and the establishment and 34 administration of a film office. The bill maintains the 35 -19- LSB 1410SV (1) 91 nls/ko 19/ 21 S.F. 465 responsibility for the IEDA to accept, receive, and administer 1 grants or other funds or gifts from public or private agencies; 2 to design and carry out a comprehensive, statewide, long-range 3 plan (plan) with the assistance of the Iowa arts council to 4 develop the arts in Iowa; and to establish advisory groups for 5 the receipt of federal funds or grants or the administration 6 of the IEDAâs programs. Under the bill, the IEDA is no longer 7 required to establish and administer a film office. Instead, 8 the IEDA is responsible for providing technical assistance for 9 the production of film, television, and video projects in the 10 state. 11 The bill eliminates certified cultural and entertainment 12 districts. The bill eliminates the cultural grant programs 13 under current law, which requires the IEDA to establish 14 a grant program for cities and nonprofit, tax-exempt 15 community organizations for the development of community 16 programs that provide local jobs for Iowa residents and 17 promote Iowaâs historic, ethnic, and cultural heritages 18 through the development of festivals, music, drama, cultural 19 programs, or tourist attractions. Additionally, the IEDA 20 is required to establish a grant program which provides 21 general operating budget support to major, multidisciplinary 22 cultural organizations that demonstrate cultural and managerial 23 excellence on a continuing basis to the citizens of Iowa. 24 Instead, the bill creates the arts and culture enhancement 25 fund (enhancement fund), under which the IEDA shall allocate 26 moneys to the fund to provide support to municipal and 27 nonprofit arts and cultural organizations that serve as 28 significant attractions or community resources; to support 29 artists and entities that foster artistic and cultural 30 expression, promote lifelong learning and engagement in the 31 arts, advance community development goals, or emphasize Iowaâs 32 diverse heritage through artwork; to increase access to arts 33 and culture in rural and underserved communities; for the 34 promotion of and investment in film, television, and video 35 -20- LSB 1410SV (1) 91 nls/ko 20/ 21 S.F. 465 projects produced in the state; and to address other goals and 1 priorities in the plan designed by the IEDA. The enhancement 2 fund consists of moneys appropriated by the general assembly 3 and any other moneys that are lawfully available to the IEDA. 4 Each fiscal year, $520,000 is appropriated from gambling 5 and sports wagering taxes to the IEDA for deposit in the 6 enhancement fund. The IEDA may establish and adopt by rule 7 eligibility and priority criteria for allocation of moneys in 8 the enhancement fund. 9 The Iowa arts council (arts council) may elect a chairperson 10 and vice chairperson from the members of the arts council, 11 rather than being designated by the governor under current law. 12 In addition to duties under current law, the arts council is 13 required to recommend programs to ensure that Iowa citizens and 14 communities have access to the cultural, civic, economic, and 15 educational benefits of the arts. 16 The bill repeals Code sections 15.437 through 15.441, 15.476 17 through 15.479, 15.481, and 15.482, eliminating the Iowa 18 cultural trust Act, including the Iowa cultural trust, trust 19 fund, grant account, and board of trustees, and eliminates the 20 arts and cultural conferences and caucuses, the cultural and 21 entertainment districts, the Iowa great places program and 22 fund, and the culture, history, and arts teams program. 23 On the effective date of this division of the bill, all 24 unencumbered and unobligated moneys remaining in the Iowa 25 great places program fund, Iowa cultural trust fund, and Iowa 26 cultural trust grant account are transferred to the arts and 27 culture enhancement fund established in the bill. 28 Division IX makes conforming changes to Code sections 16.6 29 and 16.64. 30 -21- LSB 1410SV (1) 91 nls/ko 21/ 21
