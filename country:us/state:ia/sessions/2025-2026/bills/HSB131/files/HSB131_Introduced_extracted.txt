This 34 bill amends provisions regulating marketers of grain, referred 35 -11- LSB 2306YC (8) 91 da/ns 11/ 17 H.F. _____ to as grain dealers purchasing grain (Code chapter 203), and 1 grain warehouse operators storing grain under bailment (Code 2 chapter 203C). The bill also provides for sellers of grain to 3 licensed grain dealers, and depositors storing grain with a 4 licensed grain warehouse, by indemnifying losses resulting from 5 the sale or deposit (Code chapter 203D). 6 BACKGROUND ââ LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS. The department of 7 agriculture and land stewardship (DALS) licenses a grain dealer 8 purchasing at least 1,000 bushels from producers of that grain 9 (sellers) during any calendar month (Code section 203.1). DALS 10 licenses a warehouse operator in the business of operating a 11 warehouse for the storage of bushels on behalf of title holders 12 (depositors) (Code section 203C.1). Alternatively, a warehouse 13 operator may be regulated by the United States department of 14 agriculture under the United States Warehouse Act (7 U.S.C. 15 ch. 10). A state license application must be accompanied by 16 a financial statement (Code sections 203.3 and 203C.6). A 17 grain dealer must meet certain net worth requirements to be 18 issued a class 1 license and purchase grain by credit-sale 19 contract. Normally, a grain dealerâs financial statement 20 must be accompanied by an unqualified opinion based upon an 21 audit performed by a certified public accountant licensed in 22 this state. However, DALS may accept a qualification in an 23 opinion because of the audit procedures used. DALS may also 24 accept a review by a certified public accountant in lieu of an 25 unqualified opinion. 26 BACKGROUND ââ CREDIT-SALE CONTRACTS. A credit-sale 27 contract (also referred to as deferred-payment contract, 28 deferred-pricing contract, or price-later contract) involves a 29 transaction for the sale of grain in which the grainâs producer 30 is the seller and the licensed grain dealer is the buyer. The 31 purchase price is to be paid to the seller by the licensed 32 grain dealer more than 30 days after the sellerâs delivery of 33 the grain to the licensed grain dealer or a person designated 34 by the licensed grain dealer (Code sections 203.1 and 203.8). 35 -12- LSB 2306YC (8) 91 da/ns 12/ 17 H.F. _____ Generally, there are two types of credit-sale contracts, a 1 deferred-pricing contract and a deferred-payment contract. 2 In both cases, the sellerâs payment amount is delayed until 3 after the sale (transfer of title) and delivery. Under a 4 deferred-pricing contract, the payment amount is unknown at 5 the time of sale and delivery, with the expectation that the 6 seller will receive a higher price in the future. Under 7 a deferred-payment contract, the purchase price has been 8 determined upon, or within a short time after, the grainâs sale 9 and delivery. By deferring payment, the seller elects to claim 10 income from the sale in the subsequent tax year assuming a more 11 beneficial tax rate will apply in that year (e.g., expecting a 12 reduction in farm income). 13 BACKGROUND ââ GRAIN DEPOSITORS AND SELLERS INDEMNITY 14 FUND. A seller selling grain to a licensed grain dealer or a 15 depositor depositing grain with a licensed warehouse operator 16 may be reimbursed for a loss incurred by the failure of the 17 licensee to honor a contractual obligation regarding the 18 transaction (Code section 203D.6). A payment is made from 19 the grain depositors and sellers indemnity fund (indemnity 20 fund) upon a determination that the claim is eligible for 21 indemnification by the Iowa grain indemnity fund board 22 (indemnity board) acting in cooperation with DALS. To be 23 timely, a claim must be filed within a claim period. The claim 24 period begins on either of two incurrence dates and ends 120 25 days later. An incurrence date is either when the license of 26 the grain dealer or warehouse operatorâs license ceases (is 27 revoked or voluntarily canceled) or the date a petition is 28 filed in bankruptcy. 29 BACKGROUND ââ FEES. In addition to license fees deposited 30 into the general fund of the state (Code sections 203.6 and 31 203C.33), each licensee may be required to remit either one or 32 two special fees (indemnity fees) deposited in the indemnity 33 fund, referred to as a participation fee and per-bushel fee. 34 The licensed grain dealerâs participation fee is calculated 35 -13- LSB 2306YC (8) 91 da/ns 13/ 17 H.F. _____ according to the following formula: the assessment rate of not 1 more than $0.014 multiplied by all bushels of purchased grain 2 during the grain dealerâs prior fiscal year with a minimum 3 of $50 and no maximum limit. The licensed grain dealerâs 4 per-bushel fee is calculated according to a similar formula: 5 the assessment rate of not more than $0.25 multiplied by all 6 bushels of purchased grain for the grain dealerâs assessment 7 year with no minimum and a $500 maximum limit. The qualifying 8 term âpurchased grainâ equals the total number of bushels 9 purchased from sellers minus a number of exempt bushels 10 purchased, including those purchased under credit-sale contract 11 (Code section 203D.1). Purchased grain is reported to DALS 12 as âpaid company-ownedâ (Code section 203D.1). The licensed 13 warehouse operatorâs participation fee is based on the number 14 of bushels of storage capacity of the warehouse (Code section 15 203D.5). An assessment year begins September 1 and ends August 16 31 (Code sections 203D.3 and 203D.5). The assessment year is 17 further divided into four three-month assessment quarters. A 18 grain dealer or warehouse operator may remit a participation 19 fee annually (with an application for an initial license or the 20 renewal of a license) or on a quarterly basis. A grain dealer 21 must remit a per-bushel fee on a quarterly basis (Code section 22 203D.3A). 23 BACKGROUND ââ INDEMNITY BOARD REVIEW OF INDEMNITY FUND. The 24 indemnity board must annually review the debits of and credits 25 to the indemnity fund and by May 1 determine whether to impose 26 the indemnity fees, make adjustments to the existing indemnity 27 fees, or waive the existing indemnity fees as necessary to 28 comply with two triggers. The balance in the indemnity fund 29 triggers the indemnity fees waiver or reinstatement (Code 30 section 203D.5). When the balance in the indemnity fund 31 reaches $8 million, the indemnity fees are automatically 32 waived. The indemnity fees are reinstated by the indemnity 33 board if the balance in the fund is $3 million or less (Code 34 section 203D.5). The triggered waiver or reinstatement is 35 -14- LSB 2306YC (8) 91 da/ns 14/ 17 H.F. _____ effective on the first day of the following assessment year 1 (September 1). A licensee is required to remit the outstanding 2 amount of the waived participation fee that is otherwise owing 3 for the current assessment year. However, a licensed grain 4 dealer is no longer obligated to remit the outstanding amount 5 of the per-bushel fee otherwise owing for that period, unless 6 the amount is delinquent (Code section 203D.5). 7 BACKGROUND ââ INDEMNITY FUND ââ VALUE OF LOSS. Generally, 8 a loss incurred by a depositor (holding a warehouse receipt 9 or scale weight ticket) or seller who is a party to a sale 10 may be determined using several methods of valuation. For 11 a depositor, it may be a court order hearing a matter in 12 receivership. Otherwise, the loss is based on the fair market 13 price paid to producer sellers at a nearby terminal on an 14 incurrence date. For a seller, it may be the sales price 15 agreed to by the parties. If the grain has not yet been priced, 16 the loss is again based on the fair market price paid at the 17 terminal on one of those incurrence dates. In any case, from 18 the determined loss is deducted any amount recovered by the 19 depositor or seller through other legal or equitable remedies, 20 including the liquidation of assets (Code section 203D.6). 21 BACKGROUND ââ INDEMNITY FUND ââ PAYMENT OF CLAIMS. A 22 claim must meet eligibility requirements, including that it 23 is timely filed, there is evidence of a loss incurred by a 24 claimant, and the claim derives from a covered transaction. 25 For a claimant who is a depositor, a covered transaction 26 requires that the grain must have been delivered to a licensed 27 warehouse operator. For a claimant who is a seller, a covered 28 transaction requires that title be transferred within six 29 months of the incurrence date. A covered transaction excludes 30 sale by credit-sale contract. A seller or depositor is 31 entitled to be reimbursed 90 percent of a loss but not more 32 than $300,000. 33 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ LICENSE REQUIREMENT FOR GRAIN DEALERS. 34 The bill provides that a grain dealer who purchases grain by 35 -15- LSB 2306YC (8) 91 da/ns 15/ 17 H.F. _____ credit-sale contract and is issued a class 1 license must 1 submit to DALS a financial statement that is accompanied by 2 an unqualified opinion based upon an audit performed by a 3 certified public accountant licensed in this state. DALS 4 cannot accept a qualification in an opinion or a review 5 performed by the certified public accountant. 6 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FEES ââ PAYMENT SCHEDULE. 7 The bill provides that a grain dealer or warehouse operator 8 may pay the participation fee in one installment as part of 9 the license renewal or on four successive installment dates on 10 December 15, March 15, June 15, and September 15. The bill 11 provides that the grain dealer must pay the per-bushel fee on 12 the same installment dates. 13 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FEES ââ TRIGGERS. The bill 14 adjusts both triggers waiving or reinstating the two indemnity 15 fees. The bill increases from $8 million to $16 million the 16 balance in the indemnity fund required to trigger a waiver and 17 increases from $3 million to $8 million the balance in the 18 indemnity fund required to trigger a reinstatement. 19 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FEES IMPOSED ON CREDIT-SALE 20 CONTRACT TRANSACTIONS. The bill provides that grain sold by 21 deferred-pricing contract is considered purchased grain and 22 grain sold by deferred-payment contract is not. Therefore, a 23 licensed grain dealer is only assessed an indemnity fee on the 24 deferred-pricing contract grain. 25 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FUND ââ DOLLAR VALUE OF 26 LOSS. The bill provides special valuation rules for losses 27 involving corn or soybeans. The dollar value of a loss 28 for corn cannot exceed the dollar value for a loss of U.S. 29 No. 2 yellow corn according to grain standards adopted by 30 the federal grain inspection service of the United States 31 department of agriculture. The dollar value of a loss for 32 soybeans cannot exceed the dollar value of a loss for U.S. No. 33 2 yellow soybeans according to grain standards adopted by that 34 same agency. A dollar loss incurred under a deferred-pricing 35 -16- LSB 2306YC (8) 91 da/ns 16/ 17 H.F. _____ contract is presumed the same as any other loss in which the 1 price for the grain has not been determined (e.g., determined 2 by the fair market price at the nearest terminal on the 3 incurrence date). 4 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FUND ââ PAYMENT OF CLAIMS. 5 The bill provides that the sale of grain by deferred-pricing 6 contract is no longer excluded from the meaning of a covered 7 transaction and a seller may therefore claim a dollar loss 8 resulting from the grain dealerâs default. The bill provides 9 for the payment to claimants based on an order of priority. 10 The first priority is provided to a depositor or seller, other 11 than a seller who sold grain by credit-sale contract. The 12 payout remains the same: 90 percent of the loss but not more 13 than $300,000. The second priority is provided to a seller 14 who sold grain pursuant to a deferred-pricing contract. In 15 that case, the payout is reduced to 70 percent of the loss but 16 not more than $210,000. A deferred-payment contract remains 17 ineligible for payment. 18 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FUND ââ ORDER OF PAYMENTS. 19 The board may determine when payments are to be made 20 depending upon moneys in the indemnity fund. Payments are 21 to be made on an equal basis between depositors and sellers 22 with one exception. A seller whose grain was sold under a 23 deferred-pricing contract is indemnified after depositors and 24 other sellers. 25 -17- LSB 2306YC (8) 91 da/ns 17/ 17

The department of 7 agriculture and land stewardship (DALS) licenses a grain dealer 8 purchasing at least 1,000 bushels from producers of that grain 9 (sellers) during any calendar month (Code section 203.1). DALS 10 licenses a warehouse operator in the business of operating a 11 warehouse for the storage of bushels on behalf of title holders 12 (depositors) (Code section 203C.1). Alternatively, a warehouse 13 operator may be regulated by the United States department of 14 agriculture under the United States Warehouse Act (7 U.S.C. 15 ch. 10). A state license application must be accompanied by 16 a financial statement (Code sections 203.3 and 203C.6). A 17 grain dealer must meet certain net worth requirements to be 18 issued a class 1 license and purchase grain by credit-sale 19 contract. Normally, a grain dealerâs financial statement 20 must be accompanied by an unqualified opinion based upon an 21 audit performed by a certified public accountant licensed in 22 this state. However, DALS may accept a qualification in an 23 opinion because of the audit procedures used. DALS may also 24 accept a review by a certified public accountant in lieu of an 25 unqualified opinion. 26 BACKGROUND ââ CREDIT-SALE CONTRACTS. A credit-sale 27 contract (also referred to as deferred-payment contract, 28 deferred-pricing contract, or price-later contract) involves a 29 transaction for the sale of grain in which the grainâs producer 30 is the seller and the licensed grain dealer is the buyer. The 31 purchase price is to be paid to the seller by the licensed 32 grain dealer more than 30 days after the sellerâs delivery of 33 the grain to the licensed grain dealer or a person designated 34 by the licensed grain dealer (Code sections 203.1 and 203.8). 35 -12- LSB 2306YC (8) 91 da/ns 12/ 17 H.F. _____ Generally, there are two types of credit-sale contracts, a 1 deferred-pricing contract and a deferred-payment contract. 2 In both cases, the sellerâs payment amount is delayed until 3 after the sale (transfer of title) and delivery. Under a 4 deferred-pricing contract, the payment amount is unknown at 5 the time of sale and delivery, with the expectation that the 6 seller will receive a higher price in the future. Under 7 a deferred-payment contract, the purchase price has been 8 determined upon, or within a short time after, the grainâs sale 9 and delivery. By deferring payment, the seller elects to claim 10 income from the sale in the subsequent tax year assuming a more 11 beneficial tax rate will apply in that year (e.g., expecting a 12 reduction in farm income). 13 BACKGROUND ââ GRAIN DEPOSITORS AND SELLERS INDEMNITY 14 FUND. A seller selling grain to a licensed grain dealer or a 15 depositor depositing grain with a licensed warehouse operator 16 may be reimbursed for a loss incurred by the failure of the 17 licensee to honor a contractual obligation regarding the 18 transaction (Code section 203D.6). A payment is made from 19 the grain depositors and sellers indemnity fund (indemnity 20 fund) upon a determination that the claim is eligible for 21 indemnification by the Iowa grain indemnity fund board 22 (indemnity board) acting in cooperation with DALS. To be 23 timely, a claim must be filed within a claim period. The claim 24 period begins on either of two incurrence dates and ends 120 25 days later. An incurrence date is either when the license of 26 the grain dealer or warehouse operatorâs license ceases (is 27 revoked or voluntarily canceled) or the date a petition is 28 filed in bankruptcy. 29 BACKGROUND ââ FEES. In addition to license fees deposited 30 into the general fund of the state (Code sections 203.6 and 31 203C.33), each licensee may be required to remit either one or 32 two special fees (indemnity fees) deposited in the indemnity 33 fund, referred to as a participation fee and per-bushel fee. 34 The licensed grain dealerâs participation fee is calculated 35 -13- LSB 2306YC (8) 91 da/ns 13/ 17 H.F. _____ according to the following formula: the assessment rate of not 1 more than $0.014 multiplied by all bushels of purchased grain 2 during the grain dealerâs prior fiscal year with a minimum 3 of $50 and no maximum limit. The licensed grain dealerâs 4 per-bushel fee is calculated according to a similar formula: 5 the assessment rate of not more than $0.25 multiplied by all 6 bushels of purchased grain for the grain dealerâs assessment 7 year with no minimum and a $500 maximum limit. The qualifying 8 term âpurchased grainâ equals the total number of bushels 9 purchased from sellers minus a number of exempt bushels 10 purchased, including those purchased under credit-sale contract 11 (Code section 203D.1). Purchased grain is reported to DALS 12 as âpaid company-ownedâ (Code section 203D.1). The licensed 13 warehouse operatorâs participation fee is based on the number 14 of bushels of storage capacity of the warehouse (Code section 15 203D.5). An assessment year begins September 1 and ends August 16 31 (Code sections 203D.3 and 203D.5). The assessment year is 17 further divided into four three-month assessment quarters. A 18 grain dealer or warehouse operator may remit a participation 19 fee annually (with an application for an initial license or the 20 renewal of a license) or on a quarterly basis. A grain dealer 21 must remit a per-bushel fee on a quarterly basis (Code section 22 203D.3A). 23 BACKGROUND ââ INDEMNITY BOARD REVIEW OF INDEMNITY FUND. The 24 indemnity board must annually review the debits of and credits 25 to the indemnity fund and by May 1 determine whether to impose 26 the indemnity fees, make adjustments to the existing indemnity 27 fees, or waive the existing indemnity fees as necessary to 28 comply with two triggers. The balance in the indemnity fund 29 triggers the indemnity fees waiver or reinstatement (Code 30 section 203D.5). When the balance in the indemnity fund 31 reaches $8 million, the indemnity fees are automatically 32 waived. The indemnity fees are reinstated by the indemnity 33 board if the balance in the fund is $3 million or less (Code 34 section 203D.5). The triggered waiver or reinstatement is 35 -14- LSB 2306YC (8) 91 da/ns 14/ 17 H.F. _____ effective on the first day of the following assessment year 1 (September 1). A licensee is required to remit the outstanding 2 amount of the waived participation fee that is otherwise owing 3 for the current assessment year. However, a licensed grain 4 dealer is no longer obligated to remit the outstanding amount 5 of the per-bushel fee otherwise owing for that period, unless 6 the amount is delinquent (Code section 203D.5). 7 BACKGROUND ââ INDEMNITY FUND ââ VALUE OF LOSS. Generally, 8 a loss incurred by a depositor (holding a warehouse receipt 9 or scale weight ticket) or seller who is a party to a sale 10 may be determined using several methods of valuation. For 11 a depositor, it may be a court order hearing a matter in 12 receivership. Otherwise, the loss is based on the fair market 13 price paid to producer sellers at a nearby terminal on an 14 incurrence date. For a seller, it may be the sales price 15 agreed to by the parties. If the grain has not yet been priced, 16 the loss is again based on the fair market price paid at the 17 terminal on one of those incurrence dates. In any case, from 18 the determined loss is deducted any amount recovered by the 19 depositor or seller through other legal or equitable remedies, 20 including the liquidation of assets (Code section 203D.6). 21 BACKGROUND ââ INDEMNITY FUND ââ PAYMENT OF CLAIMS. A 22 claim must meet eligibility requirements, including that it 23 is timely filed, there is evidence of a loss incurred by a 24 claimant, and the claim derives from a covered transaction. 25 For a claimant who is a depositor, a covered transaction 26 requires that the grain must have been delivered to a licensed 27 warehouse operator. For a claimant who is a seller, a covered 28 transaction requires that title be transferred within six 29 months of the incurrence date. A covered transaction excludes 30 sale by credit-sale contract. A seller or depositor is 31 entitled to be reimbursed 90 percent of a loss but not more 32 than $300,000. 33 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ LICENSE REQUIREMENT FOR GRAIN DEALERS. 34 The bill provides that a grain dealer who purchases grain by 35 -15- LSB 2306YC (8) 91 da/ns 15/ 17 H.F. _____ credit-sale contract and is issued a class 1 license must 1 submit to DALS a financial statement that is accompanied by 2 an unqualified opinion based upon an audit performed by a 3 certified public accountant licensed in this state. DALS 4 cannot accept a qualification in an opinion or a review 5 performed by the certified public accountant. 6 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FEES ââ PAYMENT SCHEDULE. 7 The bill provides that a grain dealer or warehouse operator 8 may pay the participation fee in one installment as part of 9 the license renewal or on four successive installment dates on 10 December 15, March 15, June 15, and September 15. The bill 11 provides that the grain dealer must pay the per-bushel fee on 12 the same installment dates. 13 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FEES ââ TRIGGERS. The bill 14 adjusts both triggers waiving or reinstating the two indemnity 15 fees. The bill increases from $8 million to $16 million the 16 balance in the indemnity fund required to trigger a waiver and 17 increases from $3 million to $8 million the balance in the 18 indemnity fund required to trigger a reinstatement. 19 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FEES IMPOSED ON CREDIT-SALE 20 CONTRACT TRANSACTIONS. The bill provides that grain sold by 21 deferred-pricing contract is considered purchased grain and 22 grain sold by deferred-payment contract is not. Therefore, a 23 licensed grain dealer is only assessed an indemnity fee on the 24 deferred-pricing contract grain. 25 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FUND ââ DOLLAR VALUE OF 26 LOSS. The bill provides special valuation rules for losses 27 involving corn or soybeans. The dollar value of a loss 28 for corn cannot exceed the dollar value for a loss of U.S. 29 No. 2 yellow corn according to grain standards adopted by 30 the federal grain inspection service of the United States 31 department of agriculture. The dollar value of a loss for 32 soybeans cannot exceed the dollar value of a loss for U.S. No. 33 2 yellow soybeans according to grain standards adopted by that 34 same agency. A dollar loss incurred under a deferred-pricing 35 -16- LSB 2306YC (8) 91 da/ns 16/ 17 H.F. _____ contract is presumed the same as any other loss in which the 1 price for the grain has not been determined (e.g., determined 2 by the fair market price at the nearest terminal on the 3 incurrence date). 4 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FUND ââ PAYMENT OF CLAIMS. 5 The bill provides that the sale of grain by deferred-pricing 6 contract is no longer excluded from the meaning of a covered 7 transaction and a seller may therefore claim a dollar loss 8 resulting from the grain dealerâs default. The bill provides 9 for the payment to claimants based on an order of priority. 10 The first priority is provided to a depositor or seller, other 11 than a seller who sold grain by credit-sale contract. The 12 payout remains the same: 90 percent of the loss but not more 13 than $300,000. The second priority is provided to a seller 14 who sold grain pursuant to a deferred-pricing contract. In 15 that case, the payout is reduced to 70 percent of the loss but 16 not more than $210,000. A deferred-payment contract remains 17 ineligible for payment. 18 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INDEMNITY FUND ââ ORDER OF PAYMENTS. 19 The board may determine when payments are to be made 20 depending upon moneys in the indemnity fund. Payments are 21 to be made on an equal basis between depositors and sellers 22 with one exception. A seller whose grain was sold under a 23 deferred-pricing contract is indemnified after depositors and 24 other sellers. 25 -17- LSB 2306YC (8) 91 da/ns 17/ 17
