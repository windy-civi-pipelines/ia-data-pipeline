The director of the 4 department of inspections, appeals, and licensing shall provide 5 for the notification of each employer in this state of the 6 requirements for employers provided in this Act by September 7 1, 2025. Such notification shall include suggested forms and 8 procedures that employers may use for purposes of compliance 9 with the notice and recordkeeping requirements of section 10 91A.6, as amended by this Act. 11 EXPLANATION 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 13 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 14 This bill relates to the collection of wages from employers 15 by employees under Code chapter 91A, the âIowa Wage Payment 16 Collection Lawâ. 17 The bill provides that an employer has the burden to 18 establish that a deduction from employeesâ wages is lawful and 19 that the employer must obtain written authorization for the 20 deduction from the employee in advance. 21 The bill removes the requirement that an employer be 22 notified by the director of the department of inspections, 23 appeals, and licensing before the employer is required to 24 fulfill requirements relating to employee wage and benefit 25 information. The bill requires an employer to notify employees 26 in writing whose wages are determined based on a task, piece, 27 mile, or load basis about the method used to calculate wages 28 and when wages are earned. The bill establishes a rebuttable 29 presumption that an employer did not pay the minimum wage if 30 the employer does not maintain proper payroll records. 31 The bill requires an employer to provide to each employee 32 a statement of the employeeâs earnings, deductions made, and 33 as applicable the following: for an employee paid hourly, the 34 number of hours worked during the pay period; for an employee 35 -7- LSB 1603XS (4) 91 je/js 7/ 9 S.F. 147 paid on a percentage of sales or revenue generated, a list of 1 sales or amount of revenue during the pay period; and for an 2 employee paid based on the number of miles or loads performed, 3 the applicable number performed during the pay period. 4 The bill provides that when any specified violation of Code 5 chapter 91A occurs, even if unintentional, an employer shall be 6 liable for unpaid wages or expenses plus liquidated damages, 7 court costs, and attorney fees incurred in recovering wages. 8 The bill requires the director to employ wage investigators 9 for the enforcement of Code chapter 91A. 10 The bill requires the director, upon the written complaint 11 of the employee involved, to determine whether wages have not 12 been paid and may constitute an enforceable claim. Under 13 current law, making such a determination is discretionary. 14 The bill increases the period after which the director is 15 prohibited from accepting complaints for unpaid wages and 16 liquidated damages to three years from the date the wages 17 became due and payable. Under current law, the period is one 18 year from that date. 19 Prohibitions on retaliatory actions by employers or 20 others are expanded to cover persons other than employees who 21 act under Code chapter 91A with respect to an employee. A 22 90-day period is established during which any action against 23 an employee or other person is rebuttably presumed to be 24 retaliatory. The bill allows the director or any injured party 25 to maintain a civil action in any court of proper jurisdiction. 26 An employer who retaliates against an employee or other 27 person shall compensate the injured party an amount set by the 28 director or the court, but not less than $150 for each day of 29 the violation. 30 The bill modifies language relating to procedures for 31 the director to impose civil penalties on an employer for 32 violations of Code chapter 91A by making certain actions by the 33 director mandatory. 34 The bill provides that if an employer inadvertently violates 35 -8- LSB 1603XS (4) 91 je/js 8/ 9 S.F. 147 the provisions of Code chapter 91A or the rules adopted 1 pursuant to Code chapter 91A, the employer shall not be subject 2 to certain penalty provisions provided in Code chapter 91A 3 if certain conditions are met. The first condition is that 4 the director determines that the violation was inadvertent 5 and that the employer attempted in good faith to comply with 6 the provisions of Code chapter 91A and the rules adopted 7 pursuant to Code chapter 91A. The second condition is that 8 the director, after considering any history of violations by 9 the employer, determines that the violation was isolated in 10 nature. The third condition is that the employer corrects the 11 violation to the satisfaction of the director within 14 days of 12 the occurrence of the violation. 13 The bill prohibits an employer from requiring an individual 14 to be a current employee to be paid an earned commission. 15 The bill stipulates that a provision of Code chapter 91A 16 shall not apply to any employer or employee if such provision 17 would conflict with federal law or regulation. 18 The bill requires the director to provide for the 19 notification of each employer in Iowa of the requirements for 20 employers provided in the bill by September 1, 2025. Such 21 notification shall include suggested forms and procedures that 22 employers may use for purposes of compliance with the notice 23 and recordkeeping requirements of Code chapter 91A as amended 24 by the bill. 25 An employer who violates Code chapter 91A is subject to a 26 civil penalty of not more than $500 per pay period for each 27 violation. 28 The bill, except for the provision providing for 29 notification of employees in Iowa by the director, takes effect 30 January 1, 2026. 31 -9- LSB 1603XS (4) 91 je/js 9/ 9

Such notification shall include suggested forms and 8 procedures that employers may use for purposes of compliance 9 with the notice and recordkeeping requirements of section 10 91A.6, as amended by this Act. 11 EXPLANATION 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 13 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 14 This bill relates to the collection of wages from employers 15 by employees under Code chapter 91A, the âIowa Wage Payment 16 Collection Lawâ. 17 The bill provides that an employer has the burden to 18 establish that a deduction from employeesâ wages is lawful and 19 that the employer must obtain written authorization for the 20 deduction from the employee in advance. 21 The bill removes the requirement that an employer be 22 notified by the director of the department of inspections, 23 appeals, and licensing before the employer is required to 24 fulfill requirements relating to employee wage and benefit 25 information. The bill requires an employer to notify employees 26 in writing whose wages are determined based on a task, piece, 27 mile, or load basis about the method used to calculate wages 28 and when wages are earned. The bill establishes a rebuttable 29 presumption that an employer did not pay the minimum wage if 30 the employer does not maintain proper payroll records. 31 The bill requires an employer to provide to each employee 32 a statement of the employeeâs earnings, deductions made, and 33 as applicable the following: for an employee paid hourly, the 34 number of hours worked during the pay period; for an employee 35 -7- LSB 1603XS (4) 91 je/js 7/ 9 S.F. 147 paid on a percentage of sales or revenue generated, a list of 1 sales or amount of revenue during the pay period; and for an 2 employee paid based on the number of miles or loads performed, 3 the applicable number performed during the pay period. 4 The bill provides that when any specified violation of Code 5 chapter 91A occurs, even if unintentional, an employer shall be 6 liable for unpaid wages or expenses plus liquidated damages, 7 court costs, and attorney fees incurred in recovering wages. 8 The bill requires the director to employ wage investigators 9 for the enforcement of Code chapter 91A. 10 The bill requires the director, upon the written complaint 11 of the employee involved, to determine whether wages have not 12 been paid and may constitute an enforceable claim. Under 13 current law, making such a determination is discretionary. 14 The bill increases the period after which the director is 15 prohibited from accepting complaints for unpaid wages and 16 liquidated damages to three years from the date the wages 17 became due and payable. Under current law, the period is one 18 year from that date. 19 Prohibitions on retaliatory actions by employers or 20 others are expanded to cover persons other than employees who 21 act under Code chapter 91A with respect to an employee. A 22 90-day period is established during which any action against 23 an employee or other person is rebuttably presumed to be 24 retaliatory. The bill allows the director or any injured party 25 to maintain a civil action in any court of proper jurisdiction. 26 An employer who retaliates against an employee or other 27 person shall compensate the injured party an amount set by the 28 director or the court, but not less than $150 for each day of 29 the violation. 30 The bill modifies language relating to procedures for 31 the director to impose civil penalties on an employer for 32 violations of Code chapter 91A by making certain actions by the 33 director mandatory. 34 The bill provides that if an employer inadvertently violates 35 -8- LSB 1603XS (4) 91 je/js 8/ 9 S.F. 147 the provisions of Code chapter 91A or the rules adopted 1 pursuant to Code chapter 91A, the employer shall not be subject 2 to certain penalty provisions provided in Code chapter 91A 3 if certain conditions are met. The first condition is that 4 the director determines that the violation was inadvertent 5 and that the employer attempted in good faith to comply with 6 the provisions of Code chapter 91A and the rules adopted 7 pursuant to Code chapter 91A. The second condition is that 8 the director, after considering any history of violations by 9 the employer, determines that the violation was isolated in 10 nature. The third condition is that the employer corrects the 11 violation to the satisfaction of the director within 14 days of 12 the occurrence of the violation. 13 The bill prohibits an employer from requiring an individual 14 to be a current employee to be paid an earned commission. 15 The bill stipulates that a provision of Code chapter 91A 16 shall not apply to any employer or employee if such provision 17 would conflict with federal law or regulation. 18 The bill requires the director to provide for the 19 notification of each employer in Iowa of the requirements for 20 employers provided in the bill by September 1, 2025. Such 21 notification shall include suggested forms and procedures that 22 employers may use for purposes of compliance with the notice 23 and recordkeeping requirements of Code chapter 91A as amended 24 by the bill. 25 An employer who violates Code chapter 91A is subject to a 26 civil penalty of not more than $500 per pay period for each 27 violation. 28 The bill, except for the provision providing for 29 notification of employees in Iowa by the director, takes effect 30 January 1, 2026. 31 -9- LSB 1603XS (4) 91 je/js 9/ 9
