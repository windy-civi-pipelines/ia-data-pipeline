6 This bill provides for the continuation of health insurance

8 (spouse) and each surviving child (child) of an eligible

16 the department of administrative services to be the direct and

19 factors detailed in the bill apply.
20 The state must permit continuation of existing insurance, or
21 reenrollment in previously existing insurance, for the spouse

23 the state to permit continuation of existing insurance for
24 the spouse and each child of an employee who dies and who
25 is reasonably expected to be determined to be an eligible
26 employee, until the determination of eligibility is made.
27 The bill does not require the state to pay for the cost of
28 the insurance; however, the state may pay the full cost or
29 a portion of the cost, in which case the department, agency,
30 board, bureau, commission, or other employing entity of the
31 eligible employee shall bear the cost of such insurance. If
32 the full cost or a portion of the cost of the insurance is not
33 paid by the state, the spouse and each child who is eligible
34 for insurance may elect to continue coverage by paying that
35 portion of the cost of the insurance not paid by the state.
