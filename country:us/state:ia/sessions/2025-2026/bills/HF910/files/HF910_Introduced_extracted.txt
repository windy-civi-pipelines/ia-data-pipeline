The division exempts veterans with a service-connected 16 disability rating of 100 percent as certified by the United 17 States department of veterans affairs who reside in Iowa from 18 paying annual vehicle registration fees for not more than three 19 vehicles registered by the veteran, and provides for one free 20 set of regular registration plates for each vehicle. In lieu 21 of the set of regular registration plates available without 22 fee, a veteran may obtain a set of special registration plates 23 or personalized registration plates by paying the additional 24 fees associated with those plates under current law. Under 25 current law, several special registration plates relating to 26 service in the armed forces are available at no charge to 27 eligible persons. 28 The division also exempts veterans with a service-connected 29 disability rating of 100 percent from paying a title fee and 30 provides that the department of transportation may waive any 31 administrative fee related to vehicle ownership for such a 32 veteran. 33 DIVISION II ââ DISABLED VETERAN PROPERTY TAX CREDIT. This 34 division creates a property tax credit for certain veterans. 35 -8- LSB 2883YH (3) 91 sc/js 8/ 10 H.F. 910 The division defines âqualifying veteranâ as a person 1 who meets the definition of a veteran under Code section 2 35.1 (veterans affairs), is a resident of Iowa, and has a 3 service-connected disability rating of 100 percent as certified 4 by the United States department of veterans affairs. 5 The division allows a qualifying veteran a credit on a 6 qualifying veteranâs primary residence. The amount of the 7 credit on a property is equal to the property tax owed on the 8 property. 9 Except upon a county veterans service officerâs request 10 for the purposes of providing information on benefits and 11 services available to veterans and their families, the division 12 makes confidential the list of the names and addresses of 13 individuals allowed a credit under the division and maintained 14 by the county recorder, county treasurer, county assessor, city 15 assessor, or other government body. The division prohibits 16 this information from being disseminated to any person 17 unless otherwise ordered by a court or released by the lawful 18 custodian of the records pursuant to state or federal law. 19 The county recorder, county treasurer, county assessor, city 20 assessor, or other government body responsible for maintaining 21 the names and addresses of individuals allowed a credit may 22 display the credit on individual paper records and individual 23 electronic records, including display on an internet site. 24 The division requires the department of revenue, the 25 department of administrative services, county auditors, county 26 treasurers, and assessors to administer the disabled veteran 27 tax credit in a manner similar to the military service tax 28 credit and exemptions in Code chapter 426A. 29 The division makes any person who makes a false affidavit 30 for the purpose of obtaining the disabled veteran tax credit 31 or who knowingly receives the credit without being legally 32 entitled to the credit guilty of a fraudulent practice. A 33 fraudulent practice is punishable based on the amount of value 34 involved, and may range from a simple misdemeanor punishable 35 -9- LSB 2883YH (3) 91 sc/js 9/ 10 H.F. 910 by confinement for no more than 30 days and a fine of at least 1 $105 but not more than $855, to a class âCâ felony punishable 2 by confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of at least 3 $1,370 but not more than $13,660. 4 The division appropriates from the general fund of the state 5 amounts necessary to fund the disabled veteran tax credit. 6 -10- LSB 2883YH (3) 91 sc/js 10/ 10

The division exempts veterans with a service-connected 16 disability rating of 100 percent as certified by the United 17 States department of veterans affairs who reside in Iowa from 18 paying annual vehicle registration fees for not more than three 19 vehicles registered by the veteran, and provides for one free 20 set of regular registration plates for each vehicle. In lieu 21 of the set of regular registration plates available without 22 fee, a veteran may obtain a set of special registration plates 23 or personalized registration plates by paying the additional 24 fees associated with those plates under current law. Under 25 current law, several special registration plates relating to 26 service in the armed forces are available at no charge to 27 eligible persons. 28 The division also exempts veterans with a service-connected 29 disability rating of 100 percent from paying a title fee and 30 provides that the department of transportation may waive any 31 administrative fee related to vehicle ownership for such a 32 veteran. 33 DIVISION II ââ DISABLED VETERAN PROPERTY TAX CREDIT.

The amount of the 7 credit on a property is equal to the property tax owed on the 8 property. 9 Except upon a county veterans service officerâs request 10 for the purposes of providing information on benefits and 11 services available to veterans and their families, the division 12 makes confidential the list of the names and addresses of 13 individuals allowed a credit under the division and maintained 14 by the county recorder, county treasurer, county assessor, city 15 assessor, or other government body. The division prohibits 16 this information from being disseminated to any person 17 unless otherwise ordered by a court or released by the lawful 18 custodian of the records pursuant to state or federal law. 19 The county recorder, county treasurer, county assessor, city 20 assessor, or other government body responsible for maintaining 21 the names and addresses of individuals allowed a credit may 22 display the credit on individual paper records and individual 23 electronic records, including display on an internet site. 24 The division requires the department of revenue, the 25 department of administrative services, county auditors, county 26 treasurers, and assessors to administer the disabled veteran 27 tax credit in a manner similar to the military service tax 28 credit and exemptions in Code chapter 426A. 29 The division makes any person who makes a false affidavit 30 for the purpose of obtaining the disabled veteran tax credit 31 or who knowingly receives the credit without being legally 32 entitled to the credit guilty of a fraudulent practice.
