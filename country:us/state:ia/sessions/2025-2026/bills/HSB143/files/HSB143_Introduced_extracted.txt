A failure by the department 25 to provide a notice or a failure by a seller to receive a notice 26 under this subsection, does not relieve the seller of the 27 requirement to timely file a repayment claim. 28 4. The board shall determine that a repayment claim is 29 eligible for payment from the fund if the board finds all of 30 the following: 31 a. The repayment claim was timely filed. 32 b. The repayment claimant qualifies as a seller. 33 c. The repayment claim derives from a covered transaction. 34 For purposes of this paragraph, a claim derives from a covered 35 -37- LSB 1411XD (17) 91 da/ns 37/ 47 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ transaction if the claimant is a seller who transferred title 1 to purchased grain to a licensed grain dealer other than by 2 credit-sale contract within six months of the incurrence date 3 as provided in section 203D.6. 4 d. The seller submits adequate proof to establish the 5 repayment claim and the amount of the repayment loss. 6 e. A claim has not been paid for the same repayment loss. 7 5. A seller is not entitled to indemnify a claim for a 8 repayment loss if the repayment loss is incurred as a result 9 of a fraudulent transfer or conveyance in the bankruptcy 10 proceeding. 11 6. The dollar value of a repayment claim is the amount a 12 seller is required to pay back that was previously received 13 for purchased grain as a result of an order issued, judgment 14 entered, or settlement agreement approved by a bankruptcy 15 court and which has not been recovered through other legal or 16 equitable remedies including the liquidation of assets. 17 7. The department acting on behalf of the board shall 18 deliver a notice to a seller filing a claim under this section. 19 The notice must include the boardâs determination of the 20 sellerâs eligibility and the value of the sellerâs repayment 21 loss. Within twenty days of delivering the notice, the seller 22 may request a hearing for the review of either determination. 23 The request shall be made in the manner provided by the 24 board. The hearing and any further appeal shall be conducted 25 as a contested case subject to chapter 17A. A seller whose 26 repayment claim has been refused by the board may appeal the 27 refusal to either the district court of Polk county or the 28 district court of the county in which the seller resides. 29 8. Upon a determination that the claim is eligible for 30 indemnification, the board shall provide for payment of 31 ninety percent of the repayment loss, as determined by the 32 board, but not more than three hundred thousand dollars.

In the event of the payment of a repayment loss under 6 this section, the fund is subrogated to the extent of the 7 amount of any payments to all rights, powers, privileges, 8 and remedies of the seller against any person regarding 9 the repayment loss. The seller shall render all necessary 10 assistance to the department and the board in securing the 11 rights granted in this section. No action or claim initiated 12 by a seller and pending at the time of payment from the fund 13 shall be compromised or settled without the consent of the 14 board. 15 10. a. A repayment claim shall expire if five years after 16 the board determines that the repayment claim is eligible, and 17 the claimant has failed to do any of the following: 18 (1) Provide for the fundâs subrogation or render all 19 necessary assistance to the department and the board in 20 securing the departmentâs rights of subrogation as required in 21 this section. 22 (2) Provide necessary documentation or information required 23 by the board in order to process the repayment claim. 24 b.

This bill provides for the administration of a 30 number of programs and regulations relating to agriculture, 31 including crop production, and specifically the application of 32 soil inputs such as fertilizers and soil conditioners (Code 33 chapters 200 and 200A) and pesticides (Code chapter 206); 34 animal health, and specifically the control of infectious or 35 -39- LSB 1411XD (17) 91 da/ns 39/ 47 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ contagious diseases afflicting animals (Code chapter 163), the 1 practice of veterinary medicine (Code chapter 169), and the 2 court-ordered management of livestock in immediate need of 3 sustenance (Code chapter 717); agricultural processing, and 4 specifically the slaughter and processing of meat and poultry 5 products (Code chapter 189A); and the marketing of grain and 6 the indemnification of losses by grain depositors and sellers 7 (Code chapters 203, 203C, and 203D). 8 CROP PRODUCTION ââ APPLICATION OF NUTRIENTS ââ BACKGROUND. 9 The department of agriculture and land stewardship (DALS) 10 regulates the composition of soil inputs, including nutrients 11 such as fertilizers which are manufactured to achieve optimum 12 plant growth under the Iowa fertilizer law (Code section 13 200.1), which includes a number of definitions (Code section 14 200.3). DALS also regulates fertilizing material which is 15 a substance used to compound a fertilizer, and a commercial 16 fertilizer which refers to a fertilizer, fertilizing material, 17 and a fertilizer-pesticide mixture. A secondary input is 18 referred to as a soil conditioner which is a substance other 19 than a fertilizer that improves the condition or structure 20 of the soil and is also used to improve plant growth. DALS 21 licenses persons who manufacture, offer for sale, sell, or 22 distribute a fertilizer or soil conditioner. The person is 23 also subject to a license fee (Code section 200.4). Each brand 24 or grade of commercial fertilizer or soil conditioner must 25 be registered with DALS (Code section 200.5). A fertilizer 26 or soil conditioner is subject to label requirements (Code 27 section 200.6). DALS imposes an inspection fee upon a 28 licensee (Code section 200.8). DALS must sample, inspect, 29 make analysis of, and test a commercial fertilizer or soil 30 conditioner distributed within the state (Code section 200.10). 31 A person is prohibited from manufacturing, offering for sale, 32 or selling a commercial fertilizer or soil conditioner that 33 is injurious to crop growth or deleterious to the soil (Code 34 section 200.11). A person selling a commercial fertilizer 35 -40- LSB 1411XD (17) 91 da/ns 40/ 47 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ or soil conditioner must identify substances promoting 1 its use in a manner that is not deceptive (Code section 2 200.12). DALS must adopt rules regulating equipment used 3 in storing, handling, and transporting fertilizers and soil 4 conditioners (Code section 200.14). DALS is authorized to 5 take administrative action against a licensee or registrant 6 acting in violation of the law, including by canceling the 7 license or registration (Code section 200.15), issuing a stop 8 order (Code section 200.16), or seizing a commercial fertilizer 9 or soil conditioner (Code section 200.17). A county, city, 10 or other political subdivision is prohibited from passing or 11 enforcing local legislation that regulates the use, sale, 12 distribution, storage, transportation, disposal, formulation, 13 labeling, registration, or manufacture of a fertilizer or soil 14 conditioner (Code section 200.22). A person registering a 15 pesticide must account for formulations of a fertilizer (Code 16 section 206.12). A number of Code sections include a reference 17 to soil conditioners: the definition of agricultural land 18 for purposes of eminent domain (Code section 6A.21) and urban 19 renewal (Code section 403.17) each include such a reference. 20 A transportation regulation involving hazardous materials 21 includes soil conditioners (Code section 321.1). A commodity 22 production contract lien (Code section 579B.1) covers the use 23 of a soil conditioner. An exception to the criminal offense 24 of critical infrastructure sabotage includes the use of a soil 25 conditioner (Code section 716.11). 26 CROP PRODUCTION ââ APPLICATION OF NUTRIENTS ââ BILL. The 27 bill replaces the term soil conditioner with beneficial 28 substance which is defined as a substance or compound that is 29 beneficial to one or more species of plants, soil, or media. 30 It includes a plant amendment, plant biostimulant, plant 31 inoculant, soil-amending ingredient, soil-amending form, soil 32 amendment, and soil inoculant. The bill changes references to 33 the state chemist to the bureau chief of the Iowa laboratory 34 bureau (Code sections 190C.22 and 200.10). 35 -41- LSB 1411XD (17) 91 da/ns 41/ 47 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ APPLICATION OF PESTICIDES ââ CERTIFICATION ââ BACKGROUND. 1 DALS is responsible for the administration and enforcement of 2 the âPesticide Act of Iowaâ (Code chapter 206), which in part 3 regulates the use of a pesticide by a commercial applicator, 4 public applicator, or private applicator (Code section 206.2). 5 Generally, a person acting as a commercial applicator or public 6 applicator must be certified to apply any pesticide, and a 7 person acting as a commercial applicator, public applicator, 8 or private applicator (e.g., a farmer) must be certified to 9 apply a restricted use pesticide (Code section 206.5). The 10 designation ârestricted useâ is determined by DALS (Code 11 section 206.20) and is generally based on a pesticide so 12 classified by the United States environmental protection agency 13 (40 C.F.R. Â§152.160 et seq.). DALS is required to administer 14 an educational program in cooperation with the Iowa cooperative 15 extension service in agriculture and home economics of Iowa 16 state university of science and technology. In order to be 17 certified, a person must participate in the educational program 18 by passing an examination for an initial certification and pass 19 an examination or attend instructional hours every three years 20 for the renewal of the certification (Code section 206.5). 21 APPLICATION OF PESTICIDES ââ CERTIFICATION ââ BILL. The 22 bill removes a requirement that DALS adopt by rule criteria 23 allowing a person required to be certified to complete either a 24 written or oral examination. The bill provides that DALS has 25 discretion to adopt such rules. 26 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS OR CONTAGIOUS 27 DISEASES AFFLICTING ANIMALS ââ BACKGROUND. DALS is granted 28 authority to provide for the health of animals and specifically 29 the control of an infectious or contagious disease (disease) 30 afflicting livestock populations (Code chapter 163). The term 31 âcontrolâ refers to prevention, suppression, or eradication 32 efforts (Code section 163.2). 33 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS OR CONTAGIOUS 34 DISEASES AFFLICTING ANIMALS ââ BILL. The bill provides that 35 -42- LSB 1411XD (17) 91 da/ns 42/ 47 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ DALS may determine and employ the most efficient and practical 1 means to identify and control a possible, imminent, or actual 2 threat to an animal population caused by a disease. 3 The bill provides that DALS may adopt any necessary rules 4 for the control of an infectious disease affecting animals 5 within the state by emergency rulemaking. When a statute 6 authorizes emergency rulemaking, an agency may adopt a rule 7 immediately without going through the periods of the rulemaking 8 process known as regulatory analysis (Code section 17A.4A) 9 and notice of intended action (Code section 17A.4(3)). The 10 bill requires that such emergency rulemaking be âdouble 11 barreledâ. Under the process known as double-barreled 12 rulemaking, when an agency files an emergency rule, it also 13 files the same rule as a notice of intended action that will 14 follow the regular rulemaking process. Normally, a rule 15 cannot be effective prior to 35 days after its filing with the 16 administrative rules coordinator and publication in the Iowa 17 administrative bulletin. Under emergency rulemaking, a rule 18 can be made effective on the date of filing and acceptance 19 by the administrative rules coordinator or any subsequent 20 date, as specified by the agency in the filing (Code section 21 17A.5(2)(b)(1)). 22 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ PRACTICE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE ââ 23 BACKGROUND. Veterinarians are regulated by the board of 24 veterinary medicine (veterinary board) which is responsible 25 for licensing and imposing disciplinary action, including the 26 suspension or revocation of a license for cause following a 27 notice and hearing before the veterinary board. The basis for 28 disciplinary action includes making a false representation, 29 being convicted of a felony in Iowa or another jurisdiction, 30 violating a statute or law of Iowa or another jurisdiction, 31 being subject to disciplinary action in another state, 32 assisting in the unlawful practice of veterinary medicine, 33 being adjudged as mentally incompetent, failing to conform 34 with an acceptable practice of veterinary medicine, and being 35 -43- LSB 1411XD (17) 91 da/ns 43/ 47 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ unable to practice veterinary medicine with reasonable skill 1 and safety (amended Code section 169.13). 2 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ PRACTICE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE ââ BILL. 3 The bill provides that, in addition to imposing disciplinary 4 action, the veterinary board may assess a civil penalty. 5 The amount of the civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000 per 6 violation. The attorney general may initiate a claim to 7 collect a civil penalty and any amount collected must be 8 deposited in the general fund of the state. 9 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ COURT-ORDERED MANAGEMENT OF LIVESTOCK 10 IN IMMEDIATE NEED OF SUSTENANCE ââ BACKGROUND. DALS is 11 granted the authority to petition a court to conduct a hearing 12 regarding the condition of livestock. If the court determines 13 that the livestock are in immediate need of sustenance, it 14 must issue an order directing DALS to assume supervision of 15 the livestock (Code section 717.3). The order creates a 16 super-priority lien attached to the livestock, proceeds from 17 the sale of livestock, and any associated unmanufactured 18 products, for the benefit of DALS. DALS may also petition 19 a court to order the disposition of the specified livestock. 20 The proceeds from the sale of the livestock are to be used to 21 reimburse DALS according to the lienâs super-priority status. 22 DALS may also utilize moneys deposited in the livestock 23 remediation fund (remediation fund) (Code section 459.501) 24 to pay for costs of providing for sustenance to livestock as 25 provided in the court order (Code section 717.4A). 26 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ COURT-ORDERED MANAGEMENT OF LIVESTOCK 27 IN IMMEDIATE NEED OF SUSTENANCE ââ BILL. The bill rewrites 28 a provision requiring DALS to repay the remediation fund 29 any proceeds that DALS receives from the disposition of the 30 livestock less expenses in providing for the sustenance and 31 disposition. The bill provides that if the court orders the 32 disposition of the livestock, the order shall be deemed as 33 acting in response to a petition by a receiver appointed by a 34 court in Code chapter 680. 35 -44- LSB 1411XD (17) 91 da/ns 44/ 47 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ AGRICULTURAL PROCESSING ââ SLAUGHTER AND PROCESSING OF MEAT 1 AND POULTRY PRODUCTS ââ LICENSURE ââ BILL. The bill provides 2 that a home food processing establishment licensed by the 3 department of inspections, appeals, and licensing is exempt 4 from DALS licensing requirements (Code chapter 137D). A home 5 food processing establishment refers to a residence in which 6 homemade food items are produced for sale, if consumption is 7 off premises and its business has gross annual sales of less 8 than $50,000 (Code section 137D.1). The bill also provides 9 that the term of a license issued by DALS to a slaughter and 10 processing establishment is extended to a two-year period (from 11 July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2027). The licensee fee is doubled 12 from $25 to $50 and from $50 to $100 to reflect the licenseâs 13 biennial term. DALS is required to prorate the license fee 14 for a new establishment. The bill makes various changes in 15 terminology to improve readability. 16 AGRICULTURAL MARKETING ââ MARKETING OF GRAIN AND 17 INDEMNIFICATION OF LOSSES ââ BACKGROUND. DALS licenses and 18 regulates grain dealers (dealers) and warehouse operators 19 (operators) (Code chapters 203 and 203C). Both dealers and 20 operators may be required to pay fees into the grain depositors 21 and sellers indemnity fund (indemnity fund) for purposes of 22 indemnifying losses incurred by sellers and depositors as 23 part of a transaction (Code chapter 203D). A participation 24 fee is assessed against a dealer based on purchased grain 25 during the dealerâs last fiscal year and against an operator 26 based on warehouse storage capacity. In addition, a dealer 27 may be assessed a per-bushel fee on a quarterly basis. The 28 assessment year in which a participation fee and per-bushel fee 29 is assessed is from September 1 to August 31. The assessment 30 year is divided into four three-month quarters. The last date 31 of the quarter is referred to as an installment date which 32 is when a quarterly participation payment is due. The fees 33 are deposited in the indemnity fund. When the balance in the 34 fund reaches $8 million, the participation fee and per-bushel 35 -45- LSB 1411XD (17) 91 da/ns 45/ 47 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ fees are automatically waived. The fees are reinstated if the 1 balance in the fund reaches $3 million or less (Code section 2 203D.5). 3 The indemnity fund is established as an insurance pool to 4 pay a depositor who has stored grain with a licensed warehouse 5 operator for a loss resulting from the depositorâs right to 6 receive possession of the grain, and a seller who sells grain 7 to a licensed grain dealer for a loss resulting from a failure 8 to receive payment for that grain (Code section 203D.6). The 9 indemnity fund is administered by the Iowa grain indemnity 10 fund board (indemnity board) in cooperation with DALS. A 11 depositor or seller must file a claim against the indemnity 12 fund within 120 days of an incurrence date which is the date 13 that the license of the operator or dealer ceases to be valid 14 (e.g., by revocation) or the date that an operator or dealer 15 files a petition in bankruptcy. The claim must derive from 16 a covered transaction, meaning that the claimant who is a 17 depositor must have delivered the grain to an operator or a 18 claimant who is a seller must have transferred title to the 19 grain to a dealer other than by credit-sale contract within 20 six months of the incurrence date. A credit-sale contract is 21 a contract for the sale of grain if the sale price for that 22 grain is to be paid more than 30 days after the delivery of 23 the grain to the buyer (also referred to as a deferred-payment 24 contract, deferred-pricing contract, and price-later contract). 25 A depositor or seller who timely files an eligible claim is 26 entitled to be paid from the indemnity fund for 90 percent 27 of a loss up to $300,000. If the indemnity board determines 28 that there are insufficient moneys in the indemnity fund to 29 make payment on all claims, the indemnity board may order that 30 payment on specified claims be deferred. Other procedures that 31 apply include a right to appeal the indemnity boardâs decision, 32 subrogation rights, and a five-year expiration period for 33 unresolved claims. 34 AGRICULTURAL MARKETING ââ MARKETING OF GRAIN AND 35 -46- LSB 1411XD (17) 91 da/ns 46/ 47 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ INDEMNIFICATION OF LOSSES ââ FEES ââ BILL. The bill provides 1 that a dealer or operator may remit the participation fee in 2 one installment as part of the license renewal or on four 3 successive installment dates on December 15, March 15, June 15, 4 and September 15. The bill provides that the dealer may pay 5 the per-bushel fee on the same installment dates. 6 AGRICULTURAL MARKETING ââ MARKETING OF GRAIN AND 7 INDEMNIFICATION OF LOSSES ââ REPAYMENT CLAIMS ââ BILL. The 8 bill allows a seller to file a special repayment claim against 9 the fund as a result of the grain dealerâs bankruptcy. The 10 special repayment process allows such a seller to recover 11 the amount of the grain dealer payment that the seller was 12 forced to repay to the grain dealerâs bankruptcy estate. To 13 be timely, a seller must file a repayment claim with DALS not 14 later than 30 days after the repayment loss is finalized by a 15 bankruptcy court. DALS may provide notice of the repayment 16 claim process to a seller who may file a repayment claim. 17 If DALS chooses to provide a notice to the seller, DALS has 18 discretion to determine a reasonable method and manner of 19 providing such notice. The indemnity board must determine that 20 a repayment claim is eligible for payment from the indemnity 21 fund, including whether the repayment claim derives from a 22 covered transaction. DALS is required to deliver notice to 23 a seller filing a repayment claim regarding the indemnity 24 boardâs determination in the same manner as for an ordinary 25 loss. Like an ordinary loss, the seller is entitled to receive 26 90 percent of a loss but not more than $300,000, a deferral of 27 payments based on insufficient moneys in the indemnity fund, 28 subrogation, and a five-year expiration period. 29 -47- LSB 1411XD (17) 91 da/ns 47/ 47

This bill provides for the administration of a 30 number of programs and regulations relating to agriculture, 31 including crop production, and specifically the application of 32 soil inputs such as fertilizers and soil conditioners (Code 33 chapters 200 and 200A) and pesticides (Code chapter 206); 34 animal health, and specifically the control of infectious or 35 -39- LSB 1411XD (17) 91 da/ns 39/ 47 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ contagious diseases afflicting animals (Code chapter 163), the 1 practice of veterinary medicine (Code chapter 169), and the 2 court-ordered management of livestock in immediate need of 3 sustenance (Code chapter 717); agricultural processing, and 4 specifically the slaughter and processing of meat and poultry 5 products (Code chapter 189A); and the marketing of grain and 6 the indemnification of losses by grain depositors and sellers 7 (Code chapters 203, 203C, and 203D). 8 CROP PRODUCTION ââ APPLICATION OF NUTRIENTS ââ BACKGROUND. 9 The department of agriculture and land stewardship (DALS) 10 regulates the composition of soil inputs, including nutrients 11 such as fertilizers which are manufactured to achieve optimum 12 plant growth under the Iowa fertilizer law (Code section 13 200.1), which includes a number of definitions (Code section 14 200.3). DALS also regulates fertilizing material which is 15 a substance used to compound a fertilizer, and a commercial 16 fertilizer which refers to a fertilizer, fertilizing material, 17 and a fertilizer-pesticide mixture. A secondary input is 18 referred to as a soil conditioner which is a substance other 19 than a fertilizer that improves the condition or structure 20 of the soil and is also used to improve plant growth. DALS 21 licenses persons who manufacture, offer for sale, sell, or 22 distribute a fertilizer or soil conditioner. The person is 23 also subject to a license fee (Code section 200.4). Each brand 24 or grade of commercial fertilizer or soil conditioner must 25 be registered with DALS (Code section 200.5). A fertilizer 26 or soil conditioner is subject to label requirements (Code 27 section 200.6). DALS imposes an inspection fee upon a 28 licensee (Code section 200.8). DALS must sample, inspect, 29 make analysis of, and test a commercial fertilizer or soil 30 conditioner distributed within the state (Code section 200.10). 31 A person is prohibited from manufacturing, offering for sale, 32 or selling a commercial fertilizer or soil conditioner that 33 is injurious to crop growth or deleterious to the soil (Code 34 section 200.11). A person selling a commercial fertilizer 35 -40- LSB 1411XD (17) 91 da/ns 40/ 47 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ or soil conditioner must identify substances promoting 1 its use in a manner that is not deceptive (Code section 2 200.12). DALS must adopt rules regulating equipment used 3 in storing, handling, and transporting fertilizers and soil 4 conditioners (Code section 200.14). DALS is authorized to 5 take administrative action against a licensee or registrant 6 acting in violation of the law, including by canceling the 7 license or registration (Code section 200.15), issuing a stop 8 order (Code section 200.16), or seizing a commercial fertilizer 9 or soil conditioner (Code section 200.17). A county, city, 10 or other political subdivision is prohibited from passing or 11 enforcing local legislation that regulates the use, sale, 12 distribution, storage, transportation, disposal, formulation, 13 labeling, registration, or manufacture of a fertilizer or soil 14 conditioner (Code section 200.22). A person registering a 15 pesticide must account for formulations of a fertilizer (Code 16 section 206.12). A number of Code sections include a reference 17 to soil conditioners: the definition of agricultural land 18 for purposes of eminent domain (Code section 6A.21) and urban 19 renewal (Code section 403.17) each include such a reference. 20 A transportation regulation involving hazardous materials 21 includes soil conditioners (Code section 321.1). A commodity 22 production contract lien (Code section 579B.1) covers the use 23 of a soil conditioner. An exception to the criminal offense 24 of critical infrastructure sabotage includes the use of a soil 25 conditioner (Code section 716.11). 26 CROP PRODUCTION ââ APPLICATION OF NUTRIENTS ââ BILL. The 27 bill replaces the term soil conditioner with beneficial 28 substance which is defined as a substance or compound that is 29 beneficial to one or more species of plants, soil, or media. 30 It includes a plant amendment, plant biostimulant, plant 31 inoculant, soil-amending ingredient, soil-amending form, soil 32 amendment, and soil inoculant. The bill changes references to 33 the state chemist to the bureau chief of the Iowa laboratory 34 bureau (Code sections 190C.22 and 200.10). 35 -41- LSB 1411XD (17) 91 da/ns 41/ 47 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ APPLICATION OF PESTICIDES ââ CERTIFICATION ââ BACKGROUND. 1 DALS is responsible for the administration and enforcement of 2 the âPesticide Act of Iowaâ (Code chapter 206), which in part 3 regulates the use of a pesticide by a commercial applicator, 4 public applicator, or private applicator (Code section 206.2). 5 Generally, a person acting as a commercial applicator or public 6 applicator must be certified to apply any pesticide, and a 7 person acting as a commercial applicator, public applicator, 8 or private applicator (e.g., a farmer) must be certified to 9 apply a restricted use pesticide (Code section 206.5). The 10 designation ârestricted useâ is determined by DALS (Code 11 section 206.20) and is generally based on a pesticide so 12 classified by the United States environmental protection agency 13 (40 C.F.R. Â§152.160 et seq.). DALS is required to administer 14 an educational program in cooperation with the Iowa cooperative 15 extension service in agriculture and home economics of Iowa 16 state university of science and technology. In order to be 17 certified, a person must participate in the educational program 18 by passing an examination for an initial certification and pass 19 an examination or attend instructional hours every three years 20 for the renewal of the certification (Code section 206.5). 21 APPLICATION OF PESTICIDES ââ CERTIFICATION ââ BILL. The 22 bill removes a requirement that DALS adopt by rule criteria 23 allowing a person required to be certified to complete either a 24 written or oral examination. The bill provides that DALS has 25 discretion to adopt such rules. 26 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS OR CONTAGIOUS 27 DISEASES AFFLICTING ANIMALS ââ BACKGROUND. DALS is granted 28 authority to provide for the health of animals and specifically 29 the control of an infectious or contagious disease (disease) 30 afflicting livestock populations (Code chapter 163). The term 31 âcontrolâ refers to prevention, suppression, or eradication 32 efforts (Code section 163.2). 33 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS OR CONTAGIOUS 34 DISEASES AFFLICTING ANIMALS ââ BILL. The bill provides that 35 -42- LSB 1411XD (17) 91 da/ns 42/ 47 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ DALS may determine and employ the most efficient and practical 1 means to identify and control a possible, imminent, or actual 2 threat to an animal population caused by a disease. 3 The bill provides that DALS may adopt any necessary rules 4 for the control of an infectious disease affecting animals 5 within the state by emergency rulemaking. When a statute 6 authorizes emergency rulemaking, an agency may adopt a rule 7 immediately without going through the periods of the rulemaking 8 process known as regulatory analysis (Code section 17A.4A) 9 and notice of intended action (Code section 17A.4(3)). The 10 bill requires that such emergency rulemaking be âdouble 11 barreledâ. Under the process known as double-barreled 12 rulemaking, when an agency files an emergency rule, it also 13 files the same rule as a notice of intended action that will 14 follow the regular rulemaking process. Normally, a rule 15 cannot be effective prior to 35 days after its filing with the 16 administrative rules coordinator and publication in the Iowa 17 administrative bulletin. Under emergency rulemaking, a rule 18 can be made effective on the date of filing and acceptance 19 by the administrative rules coordinator or any subsequent 20 date, as specified by the agency in the filing (Code section 21 17A.5(2)(b)(1)). 22 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ PRACTICE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE ââ 23 BACKGROUND. Veterinarians are regulated by the board of 24 veterinary medicine (veterinary board) which is responsible 25 for licensing and imposing disciplinary action, including the 26 suspension or revocation of a license for cause following a 27 notice and hearing before the veterinary board. The basis for 28 disciplinary action includes making a false representation, 29 being convicted of a felony in Iowa or another jurisdiction, 30 violating a statute or law of Iowa or another jurisdiction, 31 being subject to disciplinary action in another state, 32 assisting in the unlawful practice of veterinary medicine, 33 being adjudged as mentally incompetent, failing to conform 34 with an acceptable practice of veterinary medicine, and being 35 -43- LSB 1411XD (17) 91 da/ns 43/ 47 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ unable to practice veterinary medicine with reasonable skill 1 and safety (amended Code section 169.13). 2 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ PRACTICE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE ââ BILL. 3 The bill provides that, in addition to imposing disciplinary 4 action, the veterinary board may assess a civil penalty. 5 The amount of the civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000 per 6 violation. The attorney general may initiate a claim to 7 collect a civil penalty and any amount collected must be 8 deposited in the general fund of the state. 9 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ COURT-ORDERED MANAGEMENT OF LIVESTOCK 10 IN IMMEDIATE NEED OF SUSTENANCE ââ BACKGROUND. DALS is 11 granted the authority to petition a court to conduct a hearing 12 regarding the condition of livestock. If the court determines 13 that the livestock are in immediate need of sustenance, it 14 must issue an order directing DALS to assume supervision of 15 the livestock (Code section 717.3). The order creates a 16 super-priority lien attached to the livestock, proceeds from 17 the sale of livestock, and any associated unmanufactured 18 products, for the benefit of DALS. DALS may also petition 19 a court to order the disposition of the specified livestock. 20 The proceeds from the sale of the livestock are to be used to 21 reimburse DALS according to the lienâs super-priority status. 22 DALS may also utilize moneys deposited in the livestock 23 remediation fund (remediation fund) (Code section 459.501) 24 to pay for costs of providing for sustenance to livestock as 25 provided in the court order (Code section 717.4A). 26 ANIMAL HEALTH ââ COURT-ORDERED MANAGEMENT OF LIVESTOCK 27 IN IMMEDIATE NEED OF SUSTENANCE ââ BILL. The bill rewrites 28 a provision requiring DALS to repay the remediation fund 29 any proceeds that DALS receives from the disposition of the 30 livestock less expenses in providing for the sustenance and 31 disposition. The bill provides that if the court orders the 32 disposition of the livestock, the order shall be deemed as 33 acting in response to a petition by a receiver appointed by a 34 court in Code chapter 680. 35 -44- LSB 1411XD (17) 91 da/ns 44/ 47 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ AGRICULTURAL PROCESSING ââ SLAUGHTER AND PROCESSING OF MEAT 1 AND POULTRY PRODUCTS ââ LICENSURE ââ BILL. The bill provides 2 that a home food processing establishment licensed by the 3 department of inspections, appeals, and licensing is exempt 4 from DALS licensing requirements (Code chapter 137D). A home 5 food processing establishment refers to a residence in which 6 homemade food items are produced for sale, if consumption is 7 off premises and its business has gross annual sales of less 8 than $50,000 (Code section 137D.1). The bill also provides 9 that the term of a license issued by DALS to a slaughter and 10 processing establishment is extended to a two-year period (from 11 July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2027). The licensee fee is doubled 12 from $25 to $50 and from $50 to $100 to reflect the licenseâs 13 biennial term. DALS is required to prorate the license fee 14 for a new establishment. The bill makes various changes in 15 terminology to improve readability. 16 AGRICULTURAL MARKETING ââ MARKETING OF GRAIN AND 17 INDEMNIFICATION OF LOSSES ââ BACKGROUND. DALS licenses and 18 regulates grain dealers (dealers) and warehouse operators 19 (operators) (Code chapters 203 and 203C). Both dealers and 20 operators may be required to pay fees into the grain depositors 21 and sellers indemnity fund (indemnity fund) for purposes of 22 indemnifying losses incurred by sellers and depositors as 23 part of a transaction (Code chapter 203D). A participation 24 fee is assessed against a dealer based on purchased grain 25 during the dealerâs last fiscal year and against an operator 26 based on warehouse storage capacity. In addition, a dealer 27 may be assessed a per-bushel fee on a quarterly basis. The 28 assessment year in which a participation fee and per-bushel fee 29 is assessed is from September 1 to August 31. The assessment 30 year is divided into four three-month quarters. The last date 31 of the quarter is referred to as an installment date which 32 is when a quarterly participation payment is due. The fees 33 are deposited in the indemnity fund. When the balance in the 34 fund reaches $8 million, the participation fee and per-bushel 35 -45- LSB 1411XD (17) 91 da/ns 45/ 47 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ fees are automatically waived. The fees are reinstated if the 1 balance in the fund reaches $3 million or less (Code section 2 203D.5). 3 The indemnity fund is established as an insurance pool to 4 pay a depositor who has stored grain with a licensed warehouse 5 operator for a loss resulting from the depositorâs right to 6 receive possession of the grain, and a seller who sells grain 7 to a licensed grain dealer for a loss resulting from a failure 8 to receive payment for that grain (Code section 203D.6). The 9 indemnity fund is administered by the Iowa grain indemnity 10 fund board (indemnity board) in cooperation with DALS. A 11 depositor or seller must file a claim against the indemnity 12 fund within 120 days of an incurrence date which is the date 13 that the license of the operator or dealer ceases to be valid 14 (e.g., by revocation) or the date that an operator or dealer 15 files a petition in bankruptcy. The claim must derive from 16 a covered transaction, meaning that the claimant who is a 17 depositor must have delivered the grain to an operator or a 18 claimant who is a seller must have transferred title to the 19 grain to a dealer other than by credit-sale contract within 20 six months of the incurrence date. A credit-sale contract is 21 a contract for the sale of grain if the sale price for that 22 grain is to be paid more than 30 days after the delivery of 23 the grain to the buyer (also referred to as a deferred-payment 24 contract, deferred-pricing contract, and price-later contract). 25 A depositor or seller who timely files an eligible claim is 26 entitled to be paid from the indemnity fund for 90 percent 27 of a loss up to $300,000. If the indemnity board determines 28 that there are insufficient moneys in the indemnity fund to 29 make payment on all claims, the indemnity board may order that 30 payment on specified claims be deferred. Other procedures that 31 apply include a right to appeal the indemnity boardâs decision, 32 subrogation rights, and a five-year expiration period for 33 unresolved claims. 34 AGRICULTURAL MARKETING ââ MARKETING OF GRAIN AND 35 -46- LSB 1411XD (17) 91 da/ns 46/ 47 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ INDEMNIFICATION OF LOSSES ââ FEES ââ BILL. The bill provides 1 that a dealer or operator may remit the participation fee in 2 one installment as part of the license renewal or on four 3 successive installment dates on December 15, March 15, June 15, 4 and September 15. The bill provides that the dealer may pay 5 the per-bushel fee on the same installment dates. 6 AGRICULTURAL MARKETING ââ MARKETING OF GRAIN AND 7 INDEMNIFICATION OF LOSSES ââ REPAYMENT CLAIMS ââ BILL. The 8 bill allows a seller to file a special repayment claim against 9 the fund as a result of the grain dealerâs bankruptcy. The 10 special repayment process allows such a seller to recover 11 the amount of the grain dealer payment that the seller was 12 forced to repay to the grain dealerâs bankruptcy estate. To 13 be timely, a seller must file a repayment claim with DALS not 14 later than 30 days after the repayment loss is finalized by a 15 bankruptcy court. DALS may provide notice of the repayment 16 claim process to a seller who may file a repayment claim. 17 If DALS chooses to provide a notice to the seller, DALS has 18 discretion to determine a reasonable method and manner of 19 providing such notice. The indemnity board must determine that 20 a repayment claim is eligible for payment from the indemnity 21 fund, including whether the repayment claim derives from a 22 covered transaction. DALS is required to deliver notice to 23 a seller filing a repayment claim regarding the indemnity 24 boardâs determination in the same manner as for an ordinary 25 loss. Like an ordinary loss, the seller is entitled to receive 26 90 percent of a loss but not more than $300,000, a deferral of 27 payments based on insufficient moneys in the indemnity fund, 28 subrogation, and a five-year expiration period. 29 -47- LSB 1411XD (17) 91 da/ns 47/ 47
