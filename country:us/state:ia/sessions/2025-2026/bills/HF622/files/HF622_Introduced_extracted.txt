APPLICABILITY. This Act applies to tax years 35 -7- LSB 1949HV (2) 91 jm/jh 7/ 10 H.F. 622 beginning on or after January 1, 2026. 1 EXPLANATION 2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 3 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 4 This bill allows individuals who are residents, on or after 5 January 1, 2026, to open an interest-bearing savings account 6 with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and loan 7 association, credit union, or trust company in this state 8 and designate the account as a catastrophic savings account 9 (account) for the purpose of financing the payment of qualified 10 catastrophic expenses. 11 âQualified catastrophic expenseâ is defined in the bill 12 to mean the payment of a homeownerâs property and casualty 13 insurance deductible under an insurance policy covering 14 the account holderâs homestead, if the policy covers flood, 15 windstorm, or another catastrophic event, or the equivalent of 16 such payments by an uninsured account holder. The bill further 17 defines âcatastrophic eventâ. 18 The account may be established individually, or jointly 19 with a spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income 20 tax return. In order to properly establish the account, the 21 bill requires the account holder to submit certain forms to 22 the department of revenue (department) designating the account 23 as a catastrophic savings account (account), and designating 24 one beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary). These 25 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of 26 the year following the tax year during which the account is 27 opened. An individual may not establish more than one account. 28 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any 29 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary. 30 Contributions to an account may be made in the form of 31 cash by any person. Account funds shall not be used to pay 32 expenses, if any, of administering the account, except that 33 fees and charges may be deducted from the account by the 34 financial institution where the account is held. The bill 35 -8- LSB 1949HV (2) 91 jm/jh 8/ 10 H.F. 622 requires an account holder to submit certain reports to the 1 department, including an annual report for the account, a 2 transaction report upon a withdrawal of funds from the account, 3 and a copy of any federal internal revenue service form 1099 or 4 other similar income statement issued for the account. 5 The bill provides protection to financial institutions from 6 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable 7 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect 8 to accounts. The bill requires the department to create the 9 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt 10 rules to implement and administer the bill. 11 The bill provides two individual income tax incentives 12 relating to the accounts. First, an account holder is allowed 13 to deduct from the individual income tax up to the aggregate 14 lifetime contribution limit amount. Second, the bill exempts 15 from the individual income tax any interest received from the 16 account holderâs accounts. For account holders whose annual 17 homeownerâs property and casualty insurance policy (policy) 18 premium paid during the tax year is less than $1,000, the 19 aggregate lifetime limit shall not exceed $2,000. For an 20 account holder whose annual policy premium during the tax year 21 is equal to or exceeds $1,000, the aggregate lifetime limit 22 shall not exceed the lesser of $15,000 or twice the annual 23 policy premium. For account holders who self-insure or who are 24 unable to obtain a policy, the aggregate lifetime limit shall 25 not exceed the lesser of $350,000 or the assessed value of the 26 home. The aggregate lifetime contribution limitations of an 27 account holder may increase if an account holderâs homeownerâs 28 property and casualty homeownerâs insurance policy premium 29 increases, but are not required to decrease. 30 The bill requires an account holder to add to net income 31 for purposes of calculating the individual income tax any 32 payment from the account that is not for qualified catastrophic 33 expenses (nonqualified withdrawal), but amounts transferred 34 between different accounts of the same account holder by 35 -9- LSB 1949HV (2) 91 jm/jh 9/ 10 H.F. 622 a person other than the account holder are not considered 1 nonqualified withdrawals. Nonqualified withdrawals required 2 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal 3 to 2.5 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the 4 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account 5 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other 6 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for 7 protection under the federal bankruptcy code. If an account 8 holder dies, the amount of money in the account shall be 9 included in the taxable income of the person who receives the 10 account, unless that person is the surviving spouse of the 11 account holder. Upon the death of the surviving spouse, the 12 amount of money in the account shall be included in the taxable 13 income of the person who receives the account. Upon the sale 14 of the homestead without the purchase of a new homestead within 15 six months of the sale, the bill also requires the amount of 16 money in the account to be included in the taxable income of 17 the account holder. 18 Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of qualified 19 catastrophic expenses that are paid or reimbursed from funds in 20 an account from being allowed as an itemized deduction for Iowa 21 individual income tax purposes. 22 The tax provisions of the bill apply to tax years beginning 23 on or after January 1, 2026. 24 -10- LSB 1949HV (2) 91 jm/jh 10/ 10

APPLICABILITY. This Act applies to tax years 35 -7- LSB 1949HV (2) 91 jm/jh 7/ 10 H.F. 622 beginning on or after January 1, 2026. 1 EXPLANATION 2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 3 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 4 This bill allows individuals who are residents, on or after 5 January 1, 2026, to open an interest-bearing savings account 6 with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and loan 7 association, credit union, or trust company in this state 8 and designate the account as a catastrophic savings account 9 (account) for the purpose of financing the payment of qualified 10 catastrophic expenses. 11 âQualified catastrophic expenseâ is defined in the bill 12 to mean the payment of a homeownerâs property and casualty 13 insurance deductible under an insurance policy covering 14 the account holderâs homestead, if the policy covers flood, 15 windstorm, or another catastrophic event, or the equivalent of 16 such payments by an uninsured account holder. The bill further 17 defines âcatastrophic eventâ. 18 The account may be established individually, or jointly 19 with a spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income 20 tax return. In order to properly establish the account, the 21 bill requires the account holder to submit certain forms to 22 the department of revenue (department) designating the account 23 as a catastrophic savings account (account), and designating 24 one beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary). These 25 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of 26 the year following the tax year during which the account is 27 opened. An individual may not establish more than one account. 28 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any 29 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary. 30 Contributions to an account may be made in the form of 31 cash by any person. Account funds shall not be used to pay 32 expenses, if any, of administering the account, except that 33 fees and charges may be deducted from the account by the 34 financial institution where the account is held. The bill 35 -8- LSB 1949HV (2) 91 jm/jh 8/ 10 H.F. 622 requires an account holder to submit certain reports to the 1 department, including an annual report for the account, a 2 transaction report upon a withdrawal of funds from the account, 3 and a copy of any federal internal revenue service form 1099 or 4 other similar income statement issued for the account. 5 The bill provides protection to financial institutions from 6 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable 7 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect 8 to accounts. The bill requires the department to create the 9 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt 10 rules to implement and administer the bill. 11 The bill provides two individual income tax incentives 12 relating to the accounts. First, an account holder is allowed 13 to deduct from the individual income tax up to the aggregate 14 lifetime contribution limit amount. Second, the bill exempts 15 from the individual income tax any interest received from the 16 account holderâs accounts. For account holders whose annual 17 homeownerâs property and casualty insurance policy (policy) 18 premium paid during the tax year is less than $1,000, the 19 aggregate lifetime limit shall not exceed $2,000. For an 20 account holder whose annual policy premium during the tax year 21 is equal to or exceeds $1,000, the aggregate lifetime limit 22 shall not exceed the lesser of $15,000 or twice the annual 23 policy premium. For account holders who self-insure or who are 24 unable to obtain a policy, the aggregate lifetime limit shall 25 not exceed the lesser of $350,000 or the assessed value of the 26 home. The aggregate lifetime contribution limitations of an 27 account holder may increase if an account holderâs homeownerâs 28 property and casualty homeownerâs insurance policy premium 29 increases, but are not required to decrease. 30 The bill requires an account holder to add to net income 31 for purposes of calculating the individual income tax any 32 payment from the account that is not for qualified catastrophic 33 expenses (nonqualified withdrawal), but amounts transferred 34 between different accounts of the same account holder by 35 -9- LSB 1949HV (2) 91 jm/jh 9/ 10 H.F. 622 a person other than the account holder are not considered 1 nonqualified withdrawals. Nonqualified withdrawals required 2 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal 3 to 2.5 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the 4 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account 5 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other 6 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for 7 protection under the federal bankruptcy code. If an account 8 holder dies, the amount of money in the account shall be 9 included in the taxable income of the person who receives the 10 account, unless that person is the surviving spouse of the 11 account holder. Upon the death of the surviving spouse, the 12 amount of money in the account shall be included in the taxable 13 income of the person who receives the account. Upon the sale 14 of the homestead without the purchase of a new homestead within 15 six months of the sale, the bill also requires the amount of 16 money in the account to be included in the taxable income of 17 the account holder. 18 Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of qualified 19 catastrophic expenses that are paid or reimbursed from funds in 20 an account from being allowed as an itemized deduction for Iowa 21 individual income tax purposes. 22 The tax provisions of the bill apply to tax years beginning 23 on or after January 1, 2026. 24 -10- LSB 1949HV (2) 91 jm/jh 10/ 10
