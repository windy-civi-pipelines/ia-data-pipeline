Except for a person licensed pursuant to this chapter, 5 this section does not apply to persons who are licensed to 6 practice a health profession covered by chapter 147, when the 7 licenseeâs performance of anesthesiology assisting falls within 8 the scope of practice of the licenseeâs licensed profession. 9 EXPLANATION 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 11 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 12 This bill creates the licensed profession of anesthesiology 13 assisting under the authority of the board of medicine (board). 14 The bill allows an anesthesiologist, defined in the bill as a 15 physician and surgeon or osteopathic physician and surgeon who 16 is trained in the administration of anesthesia, to delegate 17 certain duties, listed in the bill, to an anesthesiologist 18 assistant who is licensed by the board and supervised by the 19 anesthesiologist. The bill includes definitions for both 20 âassistâ and âsupervisionâ. 21 The bill requires the board to license a person as an 22 anesthesiologist assistant if the person graduates from an 23 accredited anesthesiologist assistant program, completes an 24 appropriate certification examination, submits an application 25 on a form prescribed by the board, and pays an application 26 fee in an amount determined by the board by rule. An 27 anesthesiologist assistant shall be valid for two years and 28 may be renewed.

The bill also allows 6 a board to reinstate a revoked license if the board makes 7 certain determinations regarding the former licenseeâs fitness 8 to practice anesthesiologist assisting and the former licensee 9 applies for reinstatement. The bill prohibits a former 10 licensee from applying for reinstatement less than two years 11 from the date the license is revoked, except that a person 12 whose license was revoked due to a conviction for a crime 13 that was later reversed on repeal may apply for reinstatement 14 immediately upon the entry of reversal by the court. 15 The bill allows an anesthesiologist assistant to perform 16 only those duties delegated to the anesthesiologist assistant 17 by the supervising anesthesiologist that are within the 18 education and training of the anesthesiologist assistant. The 19 bill requires a supervising anesthesiologist to be immediately 20 available to the anesthesiologist assistant such that the 21 supervising anesthesiologist is available to intervene if 22 needed.
