NEW SECTION . 91F.12 Violations ââ remedies and 22 penalties. 23 1. If the director determines that a public body has 24 divided a public improvement into more than one contract for 25 the purpose of avoiding compliance with this chapter, the 26 director shall issue an order compelling compliance. In making 27 a determination whether a public body has divided a public 28 improvement into more than one contract for the purpose of 29 avoiding compliance with this chapter, the director shall 30 consider all of the following: 31 a. The physical separation of the public improvement 32 structures or work. 33 b. The timing of the work on the public improvement phases 34 or structures. 35 -21- LSB 1904YH (2) 91 je/js 21/ 31 H.F. 478 c. The continuity of public improvement contractors and 1 subcontractors working on public improvement parts or phases. 2 d. The manner in which the public body and the contractor 3 and subcontractors administer and implement work on the public 4 improvement. 5 2. A worker employed by the contractor or subcontractor who 6 is paid less than the specified prevailing wage rate under this 7 chapter shall have a private right of action for the difference 8 between the amount so paid and the specified prevailing wage 9 rate, together with costs and reasonable attorney fees as shall 10 be allowed by the court. 11 3. The contractor or subcontractor shall additionally be 12 liable to the department for fifty percent of the amount of 13 underpayments and shall be additionally liable to the worker 14 for punitive damages in an amount equal to five percent of the 15 liability to the department for underpayments for each month 16 following the date of payment during which underpayments remain 17 unpaid, together with costs and reasonable attorney fees as 18 shall be allowed by the court. 19 4. If a second or subsequent action to recover underpayments 20 is brought against a contractor or subcontractor within a 21 three-year period and the contractor or subcontractor is 22 found liable for underpayments to a worker, the contractor 23 or subcontractor shall be liable to the department for 24 seventy-five percent of the amount of underpayments payable 25 as a result of the second or subsequent action, additionally 26 liable to the worker for ten percent of the amount of the 27 liability to the department for underpayments for each month 28 following the date of payment during which the underpayments 29 remain unpaid, and further liable to the worker for triple 30 the difference between the amount so paid to the worker and 31 the specified prevailing wage rate required, together with 32 costs and reasonable attorney fees as shall be allowed by the 33 court. The three-year period begins to run from the date the 34 contractor or subcontractor is determined liable for the first 35 -22- LSB 1904YH (2) 91 je/js 22/ 31 H.F. 478 violation. 1 5. The director and any interested party shall also have 2 a right of action on behalf of a worker who has a right of 3 action under this chapter. An action brought to recover the 4 same shall be deemed to be a suit for wages, and all judgments 5 entered in the action shall have the same force and effect as 6 other judgments for wages. At the request of a worker employed 7 by a contractor or subcontractor who is paid less than the 8 prevailing wage rate required by this chapter, the director may 9 take an assignment of the wage claim in trust for the assigning 10 worker and may bring any legal action necessary to collect the 11 claim, and the contractor or subcontractor shall be required 12 to pay the expenses of the department incurred in collecting 13 the claim. 14 6. In circumstances where a worker may not be available to 15 receive a payment or judgment, the payment due the worker shall 16 revert to the department after one year elapses from the time 17 payment was attempted to be made or judgment was rendered. 18 7. a. It is a violation of this chapter to do any of the 19 following: 20 (1) To request or demand, either before or after the worker 21 is engaged in a public improvement, that a worker pay back, 22 return, donate, contribute, or give any part or all of the 23 workerâs wages, salary, or thing of value, to any person, upon 24 the statement, representation, or understanding that failure to 25 comply with the request or demand will prevent the worker from 26 procuring or retaining employment. 27 (2) To directly or indirectly pay, request, or authorize any 28 other person to violate this chapter. 29 b. This subsection does not apply to an agent or 30 representative of a duly constituted labor organization acting 31 in the collection of dues or assessments of the organization. 32 8. In addition to other penalties provided under this 33 chapter, whoever induces a worker working on a public 34 improvement subject to this chapter to give up or forego 35 -23- LSB 1904YH (2) 91 je/js 23/ 31 H.F. 478 any part of the prevailing wage rates to which the worker 1 is entitled under this chapter by threat not to employ 2 or by threat of dismissal from employment is guilty of a 3 serious misdemeanor. An agreement between the worker and the 4 contractor or subcontractor to work for less than the specified 5 prevailing wage rate shall not be a defense to criminal 6 prosecution. 7 9. a. A contract shall not be awarded by a public 8 body to a contractor or subcontractor who, on two separate 9 occasions within a three-year period, has been determined 10 to have violated this chapter, or to any firm, corporation, 11 partnership, or association in which the contractor or 12 subcontractor has any interest until five years have elapsed 13 from the date on which a final determination is rendered 14 finding the contractor or subcontractor in violation of this 15 chapter. 16 b. For the purposes of this subsection, âany interestâ means 17 an interest in the entity bidding or performing work on the 18 public improvement, whether as an owner, partner, officer, 19 manager, employee, agent, consultant, or representative. âAny 20 interestâ includes but is not limited to all instances where the 21 barred contractor or subcontractor receives payments, whether 22 cash or any other form of compensation, from any entity bidding 23 or performing work on the public improvement, or enters into 24 a contract with the entity bidding or performing work on the 25 public improvement for services performed or to be performed 26 under contract that have been or will be assigned or sublet, 27 or for vehicles, tools, equipment, or supplies that have been 28 or will be sold, rented, or leased during the period from the 29 initiation of the barring proceedings until the end of the term 30 of the barring period. âAny interestâ does not include shares 31 held in a publicly traded corporation if the shares were not 32 received as compensation after the barring of an entity bidding 33 or performing work on a public improvement. 34 10. If the department determines that a contractor or 35 -24- LSB 1904YH (2) 91 je/js 24/ 31 H.F. 478 subcontractor has violated this chapter on two separate 1 occasions within a three-year period, the department shall 2 list on the departmentâs internet site and keep on record 3 the name of the contractor or subcontractor and give notice 4 by restricted certified mail of the list to any public body 5 requesting the list. 6 11. Upon a determination that a contractor or subcontractor 7 has violated this chapter on two separate occasions within a 8 three-year period, the department shall notify the violating 9 contractor or subcontractor by restricted certified mail. The 10 contractor or subcontractor has ten working days to request of 11 the department a hearing before an administrative law judge on 12 the alleged violation. Failure to respond within ten working 13 days shall result in automatic and immediate barring of the 14 violator from work as provided in subsection 9 and placement 15 and publication of the violatorâs name on the departmentâs 16 internet site as provided in subsection 10. If the contractor 17 or subcontractor requests a hearing within ten working days by 18 restricted certified mail, the department shall set a hearing 19 before an administrative law judge on the alleged violation. 20 The hearing shall take place no later than forty-five calendar 21 days after the receipt by the department of the request for a 22 hearing. An action by an administrative law judge constitutes 23 final agency action and is subject to judicial review under 24 section 17A.19. 25 12. The attorney general shall prosecute the cases 26 identified in this section upon complaint by the director or by 27 any interested person. In any proceeding brought pursuant to 28 this section, the director shall be represented by the attorney 29 general. 30 13. This section does not give reason or provide cause for 31 an injunction to halt or delay any public improvement. 32 Sec. 15. NEW SECTION . 91F.13 Apprentices. 33 This chapter shall not prevent the employment of apprentices 34 upon public improvements. However, an apprentice employed 35 -25- LSB 1904YH (2) 91 je/js 25/ 31 H.F. 478 on a public improvement must be registered with the United 1 States department of laborâs office of apprenticeship under 2 an apprenticeship program registered with that office or with 3 the Iowa office of apprenticeship under an apprenticeship 4 registered with that office, paid the proper wages specified 5 in the standards of apprenticeship, and engaged only in the 6 trade to which the apprentice is registered. If the apprentice 7 is employed on a public improvement in a trade to which the 8 apprentice is not registered with the United States department 9 of laborâs office of apprenticeship, the apprentice shall be 10 treated as any other worker under this chapter. 11 Sec. 16. IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT. Section 25B.2, subsection 12 3, shall not apply to this Act. 13 Sec. 17. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act takes effect January 1, 14 2026. 15 EXPLANATION 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 17 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 18 This bill requires a contractor to pay workers the same 19 hourly wage plus fringe benefits for a public improvement 20 costing more than $25,000 as prevails in the locality of the 21 public improvement. The bill allows the per-hour wage rate to 22 be based on what is normally paid in the area by contractors 23 for similar projects, and to be adjusted on a yearly basis 24 by the department of inspections, appeals, and licensing 25 (department). 26 The wage rates that the workers must be paid shall also 27 include benefits such as medical care, life insurance, overtime 28 pay, and vacation and holiday pay. The bill applies to any 29 public improvement that receives money from a public body and 30 includes most types of public improvements from construction to 31 road maintenance to painting to hauling. 32 The director of the department (director) determines 33 the wage rates for specific geographical areas and for 34 specific crafts, classifications, and types of workers. 35 -26- LSB 1904YH (2) 91 je/js 26/ 31 H.F. 478 This information must be posted on the departmentâs internet 1 site. In determining what the wage rate for a worker is, the 2 director may consult collective bargaining agreements, wage 3 rate determinations for federal projects in the same area, and 4 other information the department may receive from contractors 5 who participate in an apprenticeship program approved by the 6 federal office of apprenticeship. 7 Any person affected by the wage rates has 15 days after 8 the department has posted the wage rates on its internet site 9 to object in writing, stating the specific reason for the 10 objection, to the director. The director must reconsider the 11 determination being objected to, and either affirm or modify it 12 within 15 days of receiving the objection. 13 If the director declines to modify the determination, 14 within 10 days, the person affected may submit an objection 15 in writing to the department, stating the specific reasons 16 for the objection. A hearing must be set by the department 17 before an administrative law judge within 45 days after the 18 objection is filed. The person who filed the objection must 19 show the administrative law judge that the wage rate was 20 somehow made in error. The department is required to show how 21 it determined the wage rate. The administrative law judge must 22 make a decision about the wage rate within 30 days and it is 23 considered a final determination. 24 The bill requires that contractors and subcontractors not 25 pay the workers less than the established wage rate but does 26 not prohibit them from paying the workers more than the wage 27 rate. The wage rate must be paid without any deductions 28 such as for food, sleeping quarters, use of tools, or safety 29 equipment. 30 The bill also requires the public body to monitor the 31 contractors and subcontractors to ensure that the wage rate 32 is paid. A call for bids must state that the wage rate must 33 be included in the bids for the public improvement. All 34 bids shall list the specific wage rates for each craft, 35 -27- LSB 1904YH (2) 91 je/js 27/ 31 H.F. 478 classification, and type of worker needed for the public 1 improvement. All contractors and subcontractors are required 2 to sign a contract that states they will pay workers the wage 3 rate determined by the department. If the contractors and 4 subcontractors are found to not be paying the wage rate, the 5 contract states that the contractorâs or subcontractorâs right 6 to work on the public improvement and get paid for work already 7 done may be terminated. 8 Before the contractor or subcontractor receives the final 9 payment for the public improvement, the public body overseeing 10 the public improvement must certify the payments include proper 11 amounts due the workers, and the contractor or subcontractor 12 must swear under oath that the records are accurate. 13 The bill does not apply to public improvement projects 14 funded by the federal government that require federal 15 prevailing wage rates. However, unless a federal provision 16 applies, if a public improvement project is financed by both a 17 state public body and the federal government, then the higher 18 of the applicable wage rates shall be paid to the workers. 19 The bill also requires that contractors and subcontractors 20 keep detailed records for at least three years about the 21 workers, the rates paid, and the hours worked for each 22 public improvement. The records are public records and must 23 be available for inspection. However, workersâ personal 24 information is not available to the public for inspection. 25 During the public improvement, a contractor or subcontractor 26 must present a certified weekly payroll to demonstrate that 27 the correct and full wage rate is being paid to workers. The 28 contractors and subcontractors must make all workers available 29 on-site to officials for interviews so that the recordsâ 30 accuracy can be checked. Contractors and subcontractors must 31 also post the wage rates for each craft, classification, and 32 type of worker in a public place where workers can see the 33 posting or at the place where they receive their wages. 34 The director is given specific powers for investigation, 35 -28- LSB 1904YH (2) 91 je/js 28/ 31 H.F. 478 enforcement, and penalization. The director may sue to prevent 1 a contractor or subcontractor from being awarded a contract for 2 a public improvement when the wage rate requirements have not 3 been met. The director is given the power to withhold payments 4 if a contractor or subcontractor does not produce records upon 5 request and to pay the workers directly if the contractor or 6 subcontractor continues to refuse to provide records. 7 After receiving a complaint, the director shall investigate 8 whether there has been a violation. If the director determines 9 there has been a violation, the contractor or subcontractor 10 must be given notice of that violation. The notice is a formal 11 written statement from the department that states the specific 12 violation and the amount of money due as a penalty. 13 If a public body has divided up a public improvement to 14 avoid having to pay the wage rate, the director shall order 15 compliance. A worker who is paid less than the wage rate set by 16 this law can sue for the difference in payment and collect the 17 difference along with costs and attorney fees in court. 18 The contractor or subcontractor shall also have to pay the 19 department 50 percent of the amount of underpayment and is 20 liable to the worker for punitive damages of up to 5 percent 21 of the underpayments for each month the underpayment remains 22 unpaid plus costs and attorney fees. 23 If a second or subsequent action for underpaying a worker 24 is brought against a contractor or subcontractor within 25 a three-year period and the contractor or subcontractor 26 is liable, the contractor or subcontractor shall pay the 27 department 75 percent of the amount of underpayment, is liable 28 to the worker for 10 percent of the penalty for underpayments 29 for each month following it that the underpayment remains 30 unpaid, and is liable to the worker for triple the difference 31 between the amount paid to the worker and the amount due under 32 the wage rate set by the director plus costs and attorney fees. 33 The director or any interested party has a right of action 34 on behalf of any individual who has a right of action under the 35 -29- LSB 1904YH (2) 91 je/js 29/ 31 H.F. 478 bill. The director may file a lawsuit in trust for a worker who 1 assigns the claim and then bring legal action to collect the 2 claim. The contractor shall be required to pay the expenses 3 for collection of the claim. 4 The bill prohibits a person from requesting or demanding 5 that a worker pay back, return, donate, contribute, or give 6 any part or all of the workerâs wages, salary, or thing of 7 value, to any person who asserts that failure to comply with 8 the request or demand will prevent the worker from procuring 9 or retaining employment. The bill prohibits a person from 10 paying, requesting, or authorizing any other person to violate 11 the requirements of the bill. However, these provisions do 12 not apply to authorized labor organization representatives 13 collecting dues or assessments. 14 In addition to other penalties under the bill, anyone who 15 attempts to get a worker to give up any part of compensation 16 on a public improvement by threat not to hire or by threat of 17 firing is guilty of a serious misdemeanor. Any agreement to 18 work for less than the determined wage rate is not a defense to 19 criminal prosecution. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by 20 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least 21 $430 but not more than $2,560. 22 If a contractor or subcontractor has violated the bill twice 23 within a three-year period, the contractor or subcontractor 24 or any company or group associated with the contractor or 25 subcontractor shall not be given any public improvement work 26 for five years. The department shall keep a list on its 27 internet site of contractors and subcontractors who have 28 violated the bill twice within a three-year period and notify 29 public bodies by restricted certified mail. 30 A contractor or subcontractor who has been notified of 31 the second violation has 10 days to request a hearing before 32 an administrative law judge. A hearing must be held within 33 45 days of the request. If no hearing is requested, the 34 contractor is barred from receiving public improvement work and 35 -30- LSB 1904YH (2) 91 je/js 30/ 31 H.F. 478 its name and information is posted on the departmentâs internet 1 site. 2 Apprentices employed on a public improvement project must 3 be registered with the federal office of apprenticeship or the 4 Iowa office of apprenticeship. Apprentices must receive the 5 wages set out in the standards of apprenticeship and do only 6 the work specified in the trade to which they are apprenticed. 7 An apprentice not registered with the federal program shall be 8 paid the wage rate the same as any other worker. 9 The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code 10 section 25B.3. The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2, 11 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from 12 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of 13 the state mandate is not provided or specified. Therefore, 14 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state 15 mandate included in the bill. 16 The bill takes effect January 1, 2026. 17 -31- LSB 1904YH (2) 91 je/js 31/ 31

NEW SECTION . 91F.12 Violations ââ remedies and 22 penalties. 23 1. If the director determines that a public body has 24 divided a public improvement into more than one contract for 25 the purpose of avoiding compliance with this chapter, the 26 director shall issue an order compelling compliance. In making 27 a determination whether a public body has divided a public 28 improvement into more than one contract for the purpose of 29 avoiding compliance with this chapter, the director shall 30 consider all of the following: 31 a. The physical separation of the public improvement 32 structures or work. 33 b. The timing of the work on the public improvement phases 34 or structures. 35 -21- LSB 1904YH (2) 91 je/js 21/ 31 H.F. 478 c. The continuity of public improvement contractors and 1 subcontractors working on public improvement parts or phases. 2 d. The manner in which the public body and the contractor 3 and subcontractors administer and implement work on the public 4 improvement. 5 2. A worker employed by the contractor or subcontractor who 6 is paid less than the specified prevailing wage rate under this 7 chapter shall have a private right of action for the difference 8 between the amount so paid and the specified prevailing wage 9 rate, together with costs and reasonable attorney fees as shall 10 be allowed by the court. 11 3.

If a second or subsequent action to recover underpayments 20 is brought against a contractor or subcontractor within a 21 three-year period and the contractor or subcontractor is 22 found liable for underpayments to a worker, the contractor 23 or subcontractor shall be liable to the department for 24 seventy-five percent of the amount of underpayments payable 25 as a result of the second or subsequent action, additionally 26 liable to the worker for ten percent of the amount of the 27 liability to the department for underpayments for each month 28 following the date of payment during which the underpayments 29 remain unpaid, and further liable to the worker for triple 30 the difference between the amount so paid to the worker and 31 the specified prevailing wage rate required, together with 32 costs and reasonable attorney fees as shall be allowed by the 33 court.

The director and any interested party shall also have 2 a right of action on behalf of a worker who has a right of 3 action under this chapter. An action brought to recover the 4 same shall be deemed to be a suit for wages, and all judgments 5 entered in the action shall have the same force and effect as 6 other judgments for wages. At the request of a worker employed 7 by a contractor or subcontractor who is paid less than the 8 prevailing wage rate required by this chapter, the director may 9 take an assignment of the wage claim in trust for the assigning 10 worker and may bring any legal action necessary to collect the 11 claim, and the contractor or subcontractor shall be required 12 to pay the expenses of the department incurred in collecting 13 the claim. 14 6. In circumstances where a worker may not be available to 15 receive a payment or judgment, the payment due the worker shall 16 revert to the department after one year elapses from the time 17 payment was attempted to be made or judgment was rendered. 18 7. a. It is a violation of this chapter to do any of the 19 following: 20 (1) To request or demand, either before or after the worker 21 is engaged in a public improvement, that a worker pay back, 22 return, donate, contribute, or give any part or all of the 23 workerâs wages, salary, or thing of value, to any person, upon 24 the statement, representation, or understanding that failure to 25 comply with the request or demand will prevent the worker from 26 procuring or retaining employment. 27 (2) To directly or indirectly pay, request, or authorize any 28 other person to violate this chapter. 29 b. This subsection does not apply to an agent or 30 representative of a duly constituted labor organization acting 31 in the collection of dues or assessments of the organization. 32 8. In addition to other penalties provided under this 33 chapter, whoever induces a worker working on a public 34 improvement subject to this chapter to give up or forego 35 -23- LSB 1904YH (2) 91 je/js 23/ 31 H.F. 478 any part of the prevailing wage rates to which the worker 1 is entitled under this chapter by threat not to employ 2 or by threat of dismissal from employment is guilty of a 3 serious misdemeanor. An agreement between the worker and the 4 contractor or subcontractor to work for less than the specified 5 prevailing wage rate shall not be a defense to criminal 6 prosecution. 7 9. a. A contract shall not be awarded by a public 8 body to a contractor or subcontractor who, on two separate 9 occasions within a three-year period, has been determined 10 to have violated this chapter, or to any firm, corporation, 11 partnership, or association in which the contractor or 12 subcontractor has any interest until five years have elapsed 13 from the date on which a final determination is rendered 14 finding the contractor or subcontractor in violation of this 15 chapter. 16 b. For the purposes of this subsection, âany interestâ means 17 an interest in the entity bidding or performing work on the 18 public improvement, whether as an owner, partner, officer, 19 manager, employee, agent, consultant, or representative. âAny 20 interestâ includes but is not limited to all instances where the 21 barred contractor or subcontractor receives payments, whether 22 cash or any other form of compensation, from any entity bidding 23 or performing work on the public improvement, or enters into 24 a contract with the entity bidding or performing work on the 25 public improvement for services performed or to be performed 26 under contract that have been or will be assigned or sublet, 27 or for vehicles, tools, equipment, or supplies that have been 28 or will be sold, rented, or leased during the period from the 29 initiation of the barring proceedings until the end of the term 30 of the barring period. âAny interestâ does not include shares 31 held in a publicly traded corporation if the shares were not 32 received as compensation after the barring of an entity bidding 33 or performing work on a public improvement. 34 10. If the department determines that a contractor or 35 -24- LSB 1904YH (2) 91 je/js 24/ 31 H.F. 478 subcontractor has violated this chapter on two separate 1 occasions within a three-year period, the department shall 2 list on the departmentâs internet site and keep on record 3 the name of the contractor or subcontractor and give notice 4 by restricted certified mail of the list to any public body 5 requesting the list. 6 11. Upon a determination that a contractor or subcontractor 7 has violated this chapter on two separate occasions within a 8 three-year period, the department shall notify the violating 9 contractor or subcontractor by restricted certified mail. The 10 contractor or subcontractor has ten working days to request of 11 the department a hearing before an administrative law judge on 12 the alleged violation. Failure to respond within ten working 13 days shall result in automatic and immediate barring of the 14 violator from work as provided in subsection 9 and placement 15 and publication of the violatorâs name on the departmentâs 16 internet site as provided in subsection 10. If the contractor 17 or subcontractor requests a hearing within ten working days by 18 restricted certified mail, the department shall set a hearing 19 before an administrative law judge on the alleged violation. 20 The hearing shall take place no later than forty-five calendar 21 days after the receipt by the department of the request for a 22 hearing. An action by an administrative law judge constitutes 23 final agency action and is subject to judicial review under 24 section 17A.19. 25 12. The attorney general shall prosecute the cases 26 identified in this section upon complaint by the director or by 27 any interested person. In any proceeding brought pursuant to 28 this section, the director shall be represented by the attorney 29 general. 30 13. This section does not give reason or provide cause for 31 an injunction to halt or delay any public improvement. 32 Sec. 15. NEW SECTION . 91F.13 Apprentices. 33 This chapter shall not prevent the employment of apprentices 34 upon public improvements. However, an apprentice employed 35 -25- LSB 1904YH (2) 91 je/js 25/ 31 H.F. 478 on a public improvement must be registered with the United 1 States department of laborâs office of apprenticeship under 2 an apprenticeship program registered with that office or with 3 the Iowa office of apprenticeship under an apprenticeship 4 registered with that office, paid the proper wages specified 5 in the standards of apprenticeship, and engaged only in the 6 trade to which the apprentice is registered. If the apprentice 7 is employed on a public improvement in a trade to which the 8 apprentice is not registered with the United States department 9 of laborâs office of apprenticeship, the apprentice shall be 10 treated as any other worker under this chapter. 11 Sec. 16. IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT. Section 25B.2, subsection 12 3, shall not apply to this Act. 13 Sec. 17. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act takes effect January 1, 14 2026. 15 EXPLANATION 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 17 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 18 This bill requires a contractor to pay workers the same 19 hourly wage plus fringe benefits for a public improvement 20 costing more than $25,000 as prevails in the locality of the 21 public improvement. The bill allows the per-hour wage rate to 22 be based on what is normally paid in the area by contractors 23 for similar projects, and to be adjusted on a yearly basis 24 by the department of inspections, appeals, and licensing 25 (department). 26 The wage rates that the workers must be paid shall also 27 include benefits such as medical care, life insurance, overtime 28 pay, and vacation and holiday pay. The bill applies to any 29 public improvement that receives money from a public body and 30 includes most types of public improvements from construction to 31 road maintenance to painting to hauling. 32 The director of the department (director) determines 33 the wage rates for specific geographical areas and for 34 specific crafts, classifications, and types of workers. 35 -26- LSB 1904YH (2) 91 je/js 26/ 31 H.F. 478 This information must be posted on the departmentâs internet 1 site. In determining what the wage rate for a worker is, the 2 director may consult collective bargaining agreements, wage 3 rate determinations for federal projects in the same area, and 4 other information the department may receive from contractors 5 who participate in an apprenticeship program approved by the 6 federal office of apprenticeship. 7 Any person affected by the wage rates has 15 days after 8 the department has posted the wage rates on its internet site 9 to object in writing, stating the specific reason for the 10 objection, to the director. The director must reconsider the 11 determination being objected to, and either affirm or modify it 12 within 15 days of receiving the objection. 13 If the director declines to modify the determination, 14 within 10 days, the person affected may submit an objection 15 in writing to the department, stating the specific reasons 16 for the objection. A hearing must be set by the department 17 before an administrative law judge within 45 days after the 18 objection is filed. The person who filed the objection must 19 show the administrative law judge that the wage rate was 20 somehow made in error. The department is required to show how 21 it determined the wage rate. The administrative law judge must 22 make a decision about the wage rate within 30 days and it is 23 considered a final determination. 24 The bill requires that contractors and subcontractors not 25 pay the workers less than the established wage rate but does 26 not prohibit them from paying the workers more than the wage 27 rate. The wage rate must be paid without any deductions 28 such as for food, sleeping quarters, use of tools, or safety 29 equipment. 30 The bill also requires the public body to monitor the 31 contractors and subcontractors to ensure that the wage rate 32 is paid. A call for bids must state that the wage rate must 33 be included in the bids for the public improvement. All 34 bids shall list the specific wage rates for each craft, 35 -27- LSB 1904YH (2) 91 je/js 27/ 31 H.F. 478 classification, and type of worker needed for the public 1 improvement. All contractors and subcontractors are required 2 to sign a contract that states they will pay workers the wage 3 rate determined by the department. If the contractors and 4 subcontractors are found to not be paying the wage rate, the 5 contract states that the contractorâs or subcontractorâs right 6 to work on the public improvement and get paid for work already 7 done may be terminated. 8 Before the contractor or subcontractor receives the final 9 payment for the public improvement, the public body overseeing 10 the public improvement must certify the payments include proper 11 amounts due the workers, and the contractor or subcontractor 12 must swear under oath that the records are accurate. 13 The bill does not apply to public improvement projects 14 funded by the federal government that require federal 15 prevailing wage rates. However, unless a federal provision 16 applies, if a public improvement project is financed by both a 17 state public body and the federal government, then the higher 18 of the applicable wage rates shall be paid to the workers. 19 The bill also requires that contractors and subcontractors 20 keep detailed records for at least three years about the 21 workers, the rates paid, and the hours worked for each 22 public improvement. The records are public records and must 23 be available for inspection. However, workersâ personal 24 information is not available to the public for inspection. 25 During the public improvement, a contractor or subcontractor 26 must present a certified weekly payroll to demonstrate that 27 the correct and full wage rate is being paid to workers. The 28 contractors and subcontractors must make all workers available 29 on-site to officials for interviews so that the recordsâ 30 accuracy can be checked. Contractors and subcontractors must 31 also post the wage rates for each craft, classification, and 32 type of worker in a public place where workers can see the 33 posting or at the place where they receive their wages. 34 The director is given specific powers for investigation, 35 -28- LSB 1904YH (2) 91 je/js 28/ 31 H.F. 478 enforcement, and penalization. The director may sue to prevent 1 a contractor or subcontractor from being awarded a contract for 2 a public improvement when the wage rate requirements have not 3 been met. The director is given the power to withhold payments 4 if a contractor or subcontractor does not produce records upon 5 request and to pay the workers directly if the contractor or 6 subcontractor continues to refuse to provide records. 7 After receiving a complaint, the director shall investigate 8 whether there has been a violation. If the director determines 9 there has been a violation, the contractor or subcontractor 10 must be given notice of that violation. The notice is a formal 11 written statement from the department that states the specific 12 violation and the amount of money due as a penalty. 13 If a public body has divided up a public improvement to 14 avoid having to pay the wage rate, the director shall order 15 compliance. A worker who is paid less than the wage rate set by 16 this law can sue for the difference in payment and collect the 17 difference along with costs and attorney fees in court. 18 The contractor or subcontractor shall also have to pay the 19 department 50 percent of the amount of underpayment and is 20 liable to the worker for punitive damages of up to 5 percent 21 of the underpayments for each month the underpayment remains 22 unpaid plus costs and attorney fees. 23 If a second or subsequent action for underpaying a worker 24 is brought against a contractor or subcontractor within 25 a three-year period and the contractor or subcontractor 26 is liable, the contractor or subcontractor shall pay the 27 department 75 percent of the amount of underpayment, is liable 28 to the worker for 10 percent of the penalty for underpayments 29 for each month following it that the underpayment remains 30 unpaid, and is liable to the worker for triple the difference 31 between the amount paid to the worker and the amount due under 32 the wage rate set by the director plus costs and attorney fees. 33 The director or any interested party has a right of action 34 on behalf of any individual who has a right of action under the 35 -29- LSB 1904YH (2) 91 je/js 29/ 31 H.F. 478 bill. The director may file a lawsuit in trust for a worker who 1 assigns the claim and then bring legal action to collect the 2 claim. The contractor shall be required to pay the expenses 3 for collection of the claim. 4 The bill prohibits a person from requesting or demanding 5 that a worker pay back, return, donate, contribute, or give 6 any part or all of the workerâs wages, salary, or thing of 7 value, to any person who asserts that failure to comply with 8 the request or demand will prevent the worker from procuring 9 or retaining employment. The bill prohibits a person from 10 paying, requesting, or authorizing any other person to violate 11 the requirements of the bill. However, these provisions do 12 not apply to authorized labor organization representatives 13 collecting dues or assessments. 14 In addition to other penalties under the bill, anyone who 15 attempts to get a worker to give up any part of compensation 16 on a public improvement by threat not to hire or by threat of 17 firing is guilty of a serious misdemeanor. Any agreement to 18 work for less than the determined wage rate is not a defense to 19 criminal prosecution. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by 20 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least 21 $430 but not more than $2,560. 22 If a contractor or subcontractor has violated the bill twice 23 within a three-year period, the contractor or subcontractor 24 or any company or group associated with the contractor or 25 subcontractor shall not be given any public improvement work 26 for five years. The department shall keep a list on its 27 internet site of contractors and subcontractors who have 28 violated the bill twice within a three-year period and notify 29 public bodies by restricted certified mail. 30 A contractor or subcontractor who has been notified of 31 the second violation has 10 days to request a hearing before 32 an administrative law judge. A hearing must be held within 33 45 days of the request. If no hearing is requested, the 34 contractor is barred from receiving public improvement work and 35 -30- LSB 1904YH (2) 91 je/js 30/ 31 H.F. 478 its name and information is posted on the departmentâs internet 1 site. 2 Apprentices employed on a public improvement project must 3 be registered with the federal office of apprenticeship or the 4 Iowa office of apprenticeship. Apprentices must receive the 5 wages set out in the standards of apprenticeship and do only 6 the work specified in the trade to which they are apprenticed. 7 An apprentice not registered with the federal program shall be 8 paid the wage rate the same as any other worker. 9 The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code 10 section 25B.3. The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2, 11 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from 12 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of 13 the state mandate is not provided or specified. Therefore, 14 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state 15 mandate included in the bill. 16 The bill takes effect January 1, 2026. 17 -31- LSB 1904YH (2) 91 je/js 31/ 31
