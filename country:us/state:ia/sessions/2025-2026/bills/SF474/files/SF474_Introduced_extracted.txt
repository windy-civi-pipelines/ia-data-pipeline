Under current law, a 16 psychiatric medical institution for children (PMIC) is an 17 institution providing more than 24 hours of continuous care 18 involving long-term psychiatric services to 3 or more children 19 in residence for expected periods of 14 days or more for 20 diagnosis and evaluation, or for expected periods of 90 days 21 or more for treatment. 22 The bill exempts PMICs from licensing requirements for 23 maintaining or conducting programs with the primary purpose 24 of treating and rehabilitating persons with a substance use 25 disorder. 26 The bill defines âapproved qualifying organizationâ as 27 the joint commission, the commission on the accreditation of 28 rehabilitation facilities, the council on accreditation, or a 29 nationally recognized accrediting organization with standards 30 comparable to the joint commission and commission on the 31 accreditation of rehabilitation facilities that are acceptable 32 under federal regulations. 33 The bill defines âmental health disorderâ as a mental 34 disorder as defined in the most recent version of the 35 -34- LSB 1457SV (6) 91 dg/ko 34/ 39 S.F. 474 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published 1 by the American psychiatric association, or a mental disorder 2 as defined in the most recent version of the international 3 classification of diseases published by the world health 4 organization. 5 The bill defines âprotective locked environmentâ as a 6 setting that prevents egress from a building or grounds as a 7 protective measure to ensure safety and security. 8 The bill defines ârecord check evaluation systemâ as the 9 record check evaluation system of HHS used to perform child and 10 dependent adult abuse record checks and to evaluate criminal 11 history and abuse records. 12 The bill defines âserious emotional disturbanceâ as a 13 diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder of 14 sufficient duration to meet diagnostic criteria specified 15 within the most current diagnostic and statistical manual 16 of mental disorders published by the American psychiatric 17 association that results in a functional impairment. âSerious 18 emotional disturbanceâ does not include a substance use 19 disorder or developmental disorder unless such disorder 20 co-occurs with such diagnosable mental, behavioral, or 21 emotional disorder. 22 The bill defines âsubstance use disorderâ as a diagnosable 23 substance use disorder of sufficient duration to meet 24 diagnostic criteria specified within the most current 25 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published 26 by the American psychiatric association that results in a 27 functional impairment. 28 The bill defines âyouthâ as a person who is less than 21 29 years of age. 30 The bill describes the nature of care a PMIC must offer youth 31 with a serious emotional disturbance (SED), a substance use 32 disorder (SUD), or both. 33 Under current law, a person who establishes a PMIC must 34 also hold a license under Code chapter 237 (child foster 35 -35- LSB 1457SV (6) 91 dg/ko 35/ 39 S.F. 474 care facilities) as a comprehensive residential facility for 1 children, or hold a license under Code chapter 125 (substance 2 use disorders) if the facility provides SUD treatment. The 3 bill eliminates the requirement that a PMIC holds either 4 of these additional licenses, and instead requires that an 5 applicant for a PMIC license specify whether the applicant will 6 provide SED services, SUD services, or both. A PMIC may only 7 provide services for which it is licensed. 8 The bill eliminates the requirement that a proposed PMIC be 9 under the direction of an agency which has previously operated 10 a facility for children or adolescents and meets or exceeds 11 requirements for licensure as a comprehensive residential 12 facility for children. 13 The bill requires the department of inspections, appeals 14 and licensing (DIAL), in cooperation with the department of 15 health and human services (HHS), to adopt rules relating to the 16 application of a protective locked environment in a PMIC. 17 Under current law, following the hospitalization hearing 18 on an involuntary commitment petition, if the court finds 19 by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent has a 20 serious mental impairment, the court shall order the respondent 21 committed for a complete psychiatric evaluation and appropriate 22 treatment. The chief medical officer (CMO) of the hospital or 23 facility at which a respondent is committed must report to the 24 court no more than 15 days after the date the respondent is 25 placed, making a recommendation for disposition of the matter. 26 The bill allows a court to place a minor respondent in a public 27 hospital and allows a CMO of the hospital no more than 30 28 days after the date the minor respondent is placed to make a 29 recommendation for disposition of the matter. 30 The bill defines âbehavioral health evaluationâ as a 31 comprehensive evaluation of a personâs mental and behavioral 32 health by a person licensed under Code chapter 154B 33 (psychology), 154C (social work), or 154D (behavioral science) 34 for purposes including but not limited to identifying a 35 -36- LSB 1457SV (6) 91 dg/ko 36/ 39 S.F. 474 possible behavioral health condition. 1 The bill defines âphysical assessmentâ as direct physical 2 touching, viewing, and medically necessary manipulation of any 3 area of a childâs body by a licensed physician. 4 The bill replaces several references to a physical or mental 5 examination with references to a physical assessment (PA) or 6 behavioral health evaluation (BHE) and replaces references to a 7 personâs abuse of alcohol or other controlled substances with 8 references to the person having a behavioral health condition. 9 Under current law, one of several specific circumstances 10 must exist before a juvenile court has the authority to enter 11 an ex parte order to direct a peace officer or a juvenile court 12 officer to take custody of a child before or after the filing 13 of a petition under Code chapter 232 (juvenile justice). The 14 bill adds the circumstance when the childâs parent, guardian, 15 or legal custodian consents to the removal as a condition that 16 would permit a juvenile court to enter such an ex parte order. 17 The bill creates similar provisions for when a juvenile court 18 may enter an ex parte order for a child to undergo an inpatient 19 PA or an inpatient BHE and when a person authorized to conduct 20 a preliminary investigation in response to a complaint 21 may motion to ask the court to order a child to undergo an 22 inpatient PA or an inpatient BHE. 23 The bill authorizes a court, after a dispositional hearing, 24 to order a male child in a child in need of assistance (CINA) 25 proceeding or a family in need of assistance (FINA) proceeding 26 to receive an inpatient PA, an inpatient BHE, or both, at the 27 state training school (STS). A request for the use of the STS 28 for purposes of a PA or BHE must be approved by the director of 29 HHS. A child ordered to the STS pursuant to a CINA proceeding 30 or a FINA proceeding must be separated at all times from 31 children placed in the STS pursuant to a juvenile delinquency 32 proceeding. Under current law, the court in a CINA or FINA 33 proceeding is prohibited from placing a child in the STS for 34 any reason. 35 -37- LSB 1457SV (6) 91 dg/ko 37/ 39 S.F. 474 The bill exempts a PMIC from licensing requirements for 1 child foster care. 2 The bill defines âprotective locked environmentâ as a 3 setting that prevents egress from a building or grounds as a 4 protective measure to ensure safety and security. The bill 5 directs HHS and DIAL to adopt rules relating to the application 6 of a protective locked environment to child foster care 7 licensees. 8 The bill directs HHS and DIAL to coordinate in developing 9 rules related to this division of the bill. The bill outlines 10 goals and considerations each department must take into account 11 while adopting such rules. 12 The bill requires HHS to convene a committee made of 13 representatives of several different organizations and persons 14 detailed in the bill to review the systems and related services 15 and supports available for youth, including but not limited to 16 systems, services, and supports related to civil commitment and 17 treatment, juvenile delinquency, and CINA. The bill details 18 the goal of the review and requires HHS to report the reviewâs 19 findings and recommendations to the governor and the general 20 assembly by October 1, 2025. 21 The bill makes conforming changes to Code chapters 135H 22 (psychiatric medical institutions for children) and 232 23 (juvenile justice). The bill repeals 2024 Iowa Acts, chapter 24 1161, sections 97 and 98. 25 DIVISION II ââ HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES ââ 26 HABILITATION SERVICES PROVIDED BY A RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM ââ 27 EXCLUSION FROM CHILDRENâS RESIDENTIAL FACILITY DEFINITION. The 28 bill excludes care furnished to persons 16 years of age or 29 older by certain residential programs detailed in the bill from 30 the definition of a childrenâs residential facility. The bill 31 requires care furnished at a residential program to persons 32 under 18 years of age to be provided in settings separate from 33 individuals over the age of 21. 34 DIVISION III ââ DIRECTOR OF JUVENILE COURT SERVICES ââ 35 -38- LSB 1457SV (6) 91 dg/ko 38/ 39 S.F. 474 CHIEF JUVENILE COURT OFFICERS. Under current law, the chief 1 juvenile court officers are appointed, terminated for cause, 2 and otherwise act under the direction and supervision of the 3 chief judge for the judicial district in which the chief 4 juvenile court officer was appointed. The bill transfers the 5 chief judgesâ authority over chief juvenile court officers to 6 the director of juvenile court services. 7 DIVISION IV ââ HAWKI ELIGIBILITY ââ PUBLIC INSTITUTION 8 INMATES. Current law does not permit a child who is an inmate 9 in a public institution to be eligible for the Hawki program. 10 The bill requires HHS to suspend, but not terminate, Hawki 11 program eligibility for a child in a public institution if the 12 child is otherwise eligible for the Hawki program except for 13 the childâs status as an inmate, the child was enrolled in the 14 Hawki program at the time the child was committed to the public 15 institution, and 30 calendar days have elapsed since the date 16 the child was committed to the public institution. A childâs 17 suspension of Hawki benefits must continue during the entire 18 period of the childâs commitment to a public institution. 19 The bill requires the public institution to which a child 20 is committed and HHS to provide monthly reports and expedite 21 the restoration of the childâs Hawki benefits upon the childâs 22 discharge from the public institution. The bill requires HHS 23 to adopt rules to administer the billâs provisions related to 24 Hawki benefits for children committed to a public institution. 25 DIVISION V ââ CORRECTIVE CHANGES. The bill updates 26 references to certain accrediting organizations through the 27 Code, corrects a reference throughout the Code related to 28 the citation for the definition of âreasonable effortsâ, 29 and changes the term âlegal custodianâ to the defined term 30 âcustodianâ. 31 -39- LSB 1457SV (6) 91 dg/ko 39/ 39

Under current law, a 16 psychiatric medical institution for children (PMIC) is an 17 institution providing more than 24 hours of continuous care 18 involving long-term psychiatric services to 3 or more children 19 in residence for expected periods of 14 days or more for 20 diagnosis and evaluation, or for expected periods of 90 days 21 or more for treatment. 22 The bill exempts PMICs from licensing requirements for 23 maintaining or conducting programs with the primary purpose 24 of treating and rehabilitating persons with a substance use 25 disorder. 26 The bill defines âapproved qualifying organizationâ as 27 the joint commission, the commission on the accreditation of 28 rehabilitation facilities, the council on accreditation, or a 29 nationally recognized accrediting organization with standards 30 comparable to the joint commission and commission on the 31 accreditation of rehabilitation facilities that are acceptable 32 under federal regulations. 33 The bill defines âmental health disorderâ as a mental 34 disorder as defined in the most recent version of the 35 -34- LSB 1457SV (6) 91 dg/ko 34/ 39 S.F. 474 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published 1 by the American psychiatric association, or a mental disorder 2 as defined in the most recent version of the international 3 classification of diseases published by the world health 4 organization. 5 The bill defines âprotective locked environmentâ as a 6 setting that prevents egress from a building or grounds as a 7 protective measure to ensure safety and security. 8 The bill defines ârecord check evaluation systemâ as the 9 record check evaluation system of HHS used to perform child and 10 dependent adult abuse record checks and to evaluate criminal 11 history and abuse records. 12 The bill defines âserious emotional disturbanceâ as a 13 diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder of 14 sufficient duration to meet diagnostic criteria specified 15 within the most current diagnostic and statistical manual 16 of mental disorders published by the American psychiatric 17 association that results in a functional impairment. âSerious 18 emotional disturbanceâ does not include a substance use 19 disorder or developmental disorder unless such disorder 20 co-occurs with such diagnosable mental, behavioral, or 21 emotional disorder. 22 The bill defines âsubstance use disorderâ as a diagnosable 23 substance use disorder of sufficient duration to meet 24 diagnostic criteria specified within the most current 25 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published 26 by the American psychiatric association that results in a 27 functional impairment. 28 The bill defines âyouthâ as a person who is less than 21 29 years of age. 30 The bill describes the nature of care a PMIC must offer youth 31 with a serious emotional disturbance (SED), a substance use 32 disorder (SUD), or both. 33 Under current law, a person who establishes a PMIC must 34 also hold a license under Code chapter 237 (child foster 35 -35- LSB 1457SV (6) 91 dg/ko 35/ 39 S.F. 474 care facilities) as a comprehensive residential facility for 1 children, or hold a license under Code chapter 125 (substance 2 use disorders) if the facility provides SUD treatment. The 3 bill eliminates the requirement that a PMIC holds either 4 of these additional licenses, and instead requires that an 5 applicant for a PMIC license specify whether the applicant will 6 provide SED services, SUD services, or both. A PMIC may only 7 provide services for which it is licensed. 8 The bill eliminates the requirement that a proposed PMIC be 9 under the direction of an agency which has previously operated 10 a facility for children or adolescents and meets or exceeds 11 requirements for licensure as a comprehensive residential 12 facility for children. 13 The bill requires the department of inspections, appeals 14 and licensing (DIAL), in cooperation with the department of 15 health and human services (HHS), to adopt rules relating to the 16 application of a protective locked environment in a PMIC. 17 Under current law, following the hospitalization hearing 18 on an involuntary commitment petition, if the court finds 19 by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent has a 20 serious mental impairment, the court shall order the respondent 21 committed for a complete psychiatric evaluation and appropriate 22 treatment. The chief medical officer (CMO) of the hospital or 23 facility at which a respondent is committed must report to the 24 court no more than 15 days after the date the respondent is 25 placed, making a recommendation for disposition of the matter. 26 The bill allows a court to place a minor respondent in a public 27 hospital and allows a CMO of the hospital no more than 30 28 days after the date the minor respondent is placed to make a 29 recommendation for disposition of the matter. 30 The bill defines âbehavioral health evaluationâ as a 31 comprehensive evaluation of a personâs mental and behavioral 32 health by a person licensed under Code chapter 154B 33 (psychology), 154C (social work), or 154D (behavioral science) 34 for purposes including but not limited to identifying a 35 -36- LSB 1457SV (6) 91 dg/ko 36/ 39 S.F. 474 possible behavioral health condition. 1 The bill defines âphysical assessmentâ as direct physical 2 touching, viewing, and medically necessary manipulation of any 3 area of a childâs body by a licensed physician. 4 The bill replaces several references to a physical or mental 5 examination with references to a physical assessment (PA) or 6 behavioral health evaluation (BHE) and replaces references to a 7 personâs abuse of alcohol or other controlled substances with 8 references to the person having a behavioral health condition. 9 Under current law, one of several specific circumstances 10 must exist before a juvenile court has the authority to enter 11 an ex parte order to direct a peace officer or a juvenile court 12 officer to take custody of a child before or after the filing 13 of a petition under Code chapter 232 (juvenile justice). The 14 bill adds the circumstance when the childâs parent, guardian, 15 or legal custodian consents to the removal as a condition that 16 would permit a juvenile court to enter such an ex parte order. 17 The bill creates similar provisions for when a juvenile court 18 may enter an ex parte order for a child to undergo an inpatient 19 PA or an inpatient BHE and when a person authorized to conduct 20 a preliminary investigation in response to a complaint 21 may motion to ask the court to order a child to undergo an 22 inpatient PA or an inpatient BHE. 23 The bill authorizes a court, after a dispositional hearing, 24 to order a male child in a child in need of assistance (CINA) 25 proceeding or a family in need of assistance (FINA) proceeding 26 to receive an inpatient PA, an inpatient BHE, or both, at the 27 state training school (STS). A request for the use of the STS 28 for purposes of a PA or BHE must be approved by the director of 29 HHS. A child ordered to the STS pursuant to a CINA proceeding 30 or a FINA proceeding must be separated at all times from 31 children placed in the STS pursuant to a juvenile delinquency 32 proceeding. Under current law, the court in a CINA or FINA 33 proceeding is prohibited from placing a child in the STS for 34 any reason. 35 -37- LSB 1457SV (6) 91 dg/ko 37/ 39 S.F. 474 The bill exempts a PMIC from licensing requirements for 1 child foster care. 2 The bill defines âprotective locked environmentâ as a 3 setting that prevents egress from a building or grounds as a 4 protective measure to ensure safety and security. The bill 5 directs HHS and DIAL to adopt rules relating to the application 6 of a protective locked environment to child foster care 7 licensees. 8 The bill directs HHS and DIAL to coordinate in developing 9 rules related to this division of the bill. The bill outlines 10 goals and considerations each department must take into account 11 while adopting such rules. 12 The bill requires HHS to convene a committee made of 13 representatives of several different organizations and persons 14 detailed in the bill to review the systems and related services 15 and supports available for youth, including but not limited to 16 systems, services, and supports related to civil commitment and 17 treatment, juvenile delinquency, and CINA. The bill details 18 the goal of the review and requires HHS to report the reviewâs 19 findings and recommendations to the governor and the general 20 assembly by October 1, 2025. 21 The bill makes conforming changes to Code chapters 135H 22 (psychiatric medical institutions for children) and 232 23 (juvenile justice). The bill repeals 2024 Iowa Acts, chapter 24 1161, sections 97 and 98. 25 DIVISION II ââ HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES ââ 26 HABILITATION SERVICES PROVIDED BY A RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM ââ 27 EXCLUSION FROM CHILDRENâS RESIDENTIAL FACILITY DEFINITION. The 28 bill excludes care furnished to persons 16 years of age or 29 older by certain residential programs detailed in the bill from 30 the definition of a childrenâs residential facility. The bill 31 requires care furnished at a residential program to persons 32 under 18 years of age to be provided in settings separate from 33 individuals over the age of 21. 34 DIVISION III ââ DIRECTOR OF JUVENILE COURT SERVICES ââ 35 -38- LSB 1457SV (6) 91 dg/ko 38/ 39 S.F. 474 CHIEF JUVENILE COURT OFFICERS. Under current law, the chief 1 juvenile court officers are appointed, terminated for cause, 2 and otherwise act under the direction and supervision of the 3 chief judge for the judicial district in which the chief 4 juvenile court officer was appointed. The bill transfers the 5 chief judgesâ authority over chief juvenile court officers to 6 the director of juvenile court services. 7 DIVISION IV ââ HAWKI ELIGIBILITY ââ PUBLIC INSTITUTION 8 INMATES. Current law does not permit a child who is an inmate 9 in a public institution to be eligible for the Hawki program. 10 The bill requires HHS to suspend, but not terminate, Hawki 11 program eligibility for a child in a public institution if the 12 child is otherwise eligible for the Hawki program except for 13 the childâs status as an inmate, the child was enrolled in the 14 Hawki program at the time the child was committed to the public 15 institution, and 30 calendar days have elapsed since the date 16 the child was committed to the public institution. A childâs 17 suspension of Hawki benefits must continue during the entire 18 period of the childâs commitment to a public institution. 19 The bill requires the public institution to which a child 20 is committed and HHS to provide monthly reports and expedite 21 the restoration of the childâs Hawki benefits upon the childâs 22 discharge from the public institution. The bill requires HHS 23 to adopt rules to administer the billâs provisions related to 24 Hawki benefits for children committed to a public institution. 25 DIVISION V ââ CORRECTIVE CHANGES. The bill updates 26 references to certain accrediting organizations through the 27 Code, corrects a reference throughout the Code related to 28 the citation for the definition of âreasonable effortsâ, 29 and changes the term âlegal custodianâ to the defined term 30 âcustodianâ. 31 -39- LSB 1457SV (6) 91 dg/ko 39/ 39
