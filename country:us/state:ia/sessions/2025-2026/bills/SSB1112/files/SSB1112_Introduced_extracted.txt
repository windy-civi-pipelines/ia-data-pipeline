A public utility that elects to 7 propose a tariff or tariff amendment under this subsection 8 shall file an application for approval with the commission. 9 The application shall include an identification of costs and 10 benefits related to the program for the commissionâs review of 11 the conditions specified in paragraph âbâ , subparagraph (1). 12 (2) Within thirty days, the commission shall approve, deny, 13 or docket for further review an application for a tariff or 14 amended tariff submitted pursuant to this subsection. If the 15 application is docketed for further review, the commission 16 shall render a decision within ninety days from the date of 17 application filing unless an objection has been filed with the 18 commission. If the application proposes to amend a tariff 19 previously approved under this subsection, the commission shall 20 not reconsider existing programs previously approved under the 21 tariff unless proposed as part of the amendment. All further 22 review shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to 23 chapter 17A. 24 (3) If the application proposes to amend a tariff previously 25 approved under this subsection as described in paragraph âbâ , 26 subparagraph (2), the commission shall act on the application 27 as described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, but shall 28 not reconsider existing programs previously approved under the 29 tariff unless proposed as part of the amendment. 30 (4) In the exercise of its authority under this subsection, 31 the commission shall not: 32 (a) Limit the number of applications a public utility may 33 file pursuant to this subsection. 34 (b) Deny a tariff because a public utility is subject to an 35 -10- LSB 1121XL (9) 91 sb/js 10/ 53 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ alternative regulatory mechanism, nor require a public utility 1 subject to an alternative regulatory mechanism to record the 2 revenues and costs associated with the program inconsistent 3 with the federal energy regulatory commissionâs uniform system 4 of accounts; provided, however, that this provision shall not 5 prohibit the utilities commission from denying a tariff if the 6 proposed tariff would result in detrimental treatment of other 7 customers, or require adjustment to the calculation of the 8 alternative regulatory mechanism to reflect the impact of an 9 approved tariff. 10 (c) Condition its approval on the public utility changing 11 its proposal if the public utility has not agreed to such 12 changes. This subparagraph division shall not be interpreted 13 to prevent the commission from identifying changes to the 14 proposal that might result in approval. 15 (5) Tariffs and programs approved pursuant to this 16 subsection shall be rebuttably presumed just and reasonable in 17 any subsequent general rate case proceeding. 18 d. The commission shall not condition approval or denial of 19 a tariff on final adoption of rules by the commission. 20 e. The commission shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A 21 to implement this subsection. 22 Sec. 8. APPLICABILITY. This division of this Act applies 23 to a public utility filing an application with the utilities 24 commission for review of a tariff on or after the effective 25 date of this division of this Act. 26 DIVISION III 27 LAND RESTORATION ââ ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION LINES APPROVED BY 28 FEDERALLY REGISTERED PLANNING AUTHORITY TRANSMISSION PLANS 29 Sec. 9.

Negative impacts include additional costs incurred 11 by nonparticipating customers due to costs arising from the 12 tariff, tariff participants no longer sharing in customer 13 class costs, or decreased customer benefit from existing 14 infrastructure. 15 Division II of the bill explains that a tariff may include 16 provisions relating to recovery of costs, rate of return, 17 application of the program to other specified patterns, program 18 benefits, and refunds, credits, or waivers when the program 19 replaces an existing service, or recovery of costs associated 20 with existing facilities. A participating program customer 21 shall pay the costs of the services received from the public 22 utility unless the costs are refunded, credited, or waived 23 under the program. Division II of the bill provides that 24 if the program or eligible customer group cease to exist and 25 the public utility seeks recovery of the program-specific 26 facilities through a general rate case proceeding, the public 27 utility shall demonstrate the reasonableness and prudence 28 without any presumption regarding approval of such request. A 29 public utility shall be allowed to recover program-specific 30 facilities through general rate case proceedings. If the 31 utility can demonstrate to the commission that the proposed 32 tariff generates excess revenue for the utility as compared to 33 total revenue without the tariff, the excess revenue may be 34 retained by the utility. 35 -40- LSB 1121XL (9) 91 sb/js 40/ 53 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ Division II of the bill provides for tariff application 1 and approval. A public utilityâs authority is not mandatory 2 regarding tariffs. Division II of the bill provides that an 3 application for a tariff or amendment to a tariff shall be 4 filed with the commission. The commission shall approve, deny, 5 or docket for further review an application within 30 days. 6 If the commission dockets the application for further review, 7 the commission shall render a decision within 90 days from the 8 date of application filing, unless an objection is filed. The 9 commission shall not reconsider existing programs previously 10 approved under the tariff during a review of an application 11 for an amendment to a tariff unless the review of a program is 12 proposed as part of the amendment. 13 Division II of the bill prohibits the commission from 14 certain actions. Division II of the bill provides that 15 the commission shall not limit the number of applications a 16 public utility may file, deny, or condition the approval of a 17 tariff because a public utility is subject to an alternative 18 regulatory mechanism, or require a public utility subject to an 19 alternative regulatory mechanism to record revenues and costs 20 in an inconsistent manner with specified federal standards, 21 provided that the proposed tariff would not result in 22 detrimental treatment of other customers or require adjustment 23 to the calculation of the alternative regulatory mechanism to 24 reflect the impact of an approved tariff. Division II of the 25 bill prohibits the commission from conditioning approval of a 26 tariff on the requirement that the public utility change the 27 proposal to unagreed-upon terms, but this prohibition does not 28 prevent the commission from identifying changes to the proposal 29 that might result in approval. 30 Division II of the bill provides that tariffs and programs 31 approved pursuant to division II of the bill shall be 32 rebuttably presumed to be just and reasonable in general rate 33 case proceedings. Division II of the bill prohibits the 34 commission from conditioning approval or denial of a tariff 35 -41- LSB 1121XL (9) 91 sb/js 41/ 53 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ on the final adoption of rules and requires the commission to 1 adopt rules related to division II of the bill. 2 Division II of the bill applies to a public utility filing an 3 application with the commission for review of a tariff on or 4 after the effective date of division II of the bill. 5 Division III of the bill relates to electric transmission 6 lines and electric transmission owners.

Participants in a tariff 17 approved pursuant to this section shall participate in future 18 indirect costs allocated to customers of that utility without 19 regard for the existence of a tariff approved pursuant to this 20 section. 21 (e) A tariff shall not alter the existing base rates or 22 charges of the public utility. Refund, credit, or waiver of 23 existing base rates or charges offered as part of the program 24 shall not be considered an alteration of existing base rates 25 or charges. 26 (f) The program created under the tariff shall not 27 negatively impact nonparticipating customers. Additional 28 costs incurred by nonparticipating customers due to costs 29 arising from the tariff, tariff participants no longer sharing 30 in customer class costs, or decreased customer benefit from 31 existing infrastructure shall be considered negative impacts. 32 (2) A tariff authorized under this subsection may include 33 any of the following: 34 (a) Recovery of costs associated with program-specific 35 -8- LSB 1121XL (9) 91 sb/js 8/ 53 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ services or facilities, including but not limited to energy 1 storage, renewable hydrogen, transmission, electric generating 2 facilities, electric distribution facilities, renewable natural 3 gas generation facilities, renewable natural gas distribution 4 facilities, utility-assisted hourly prices, or liquefied 5 natural gas facilities, or administrative and other overhead 6 costs relating to the same. 7 (b) A negotiated rate of return, for new or existing 8 facilities or services provided by the electric utility that 9 are serving the program created under the tariff, applicable to 10 the program for its duration. The use of existing facilities 11 would require reconciliation of impact to existing customers 12 and would no longer be subject to previously approved advance 13 ratemaking principles. In the event that the tariff or its 14 eligible customer class cease to exist, no charges shall be 15 imposed on or costs recovered from existing customers unless 16 approved in a general rate case. A utility may seek to 17 demonstrate the prudence, necessity, and use and usefulness 18 of program-specific facilities or services as defined in 19 subparagraph division (a) and recovery of costs for the same in 20 a general rate proceeding, without any presumption regarding 21 approval of such request. 22 (c) Application of the program to readily identifiable 23 customer usage patterns, customer characteristics, or output 24 of specified facilities. 25 (d) Assignment of program benefits, including nonmonetary 26 benefits that may derive from dynamically balancing supply and 27 demand, providing ancillary services, or the production of 28 renewable energy attributes. 29 (e) Refund, credit, or waive the base rate or charge for 30 the replaced service when the program created under the tariff 31 replaces a service for which the public utility collects an 32 existing base rate or charge. A participating customer shall 33 pay the costs of remaining services received from the public 34 utility unless those costs are refunded, credited, or waived 35 -9- LSB 1121XL (9) 91 sb/js 9/ 53 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ under the program created by the tariff. 1 (3) If a utility can demonstrate to the commission that 2 a proposed tariff generates excess revenue for the utility 3 as compared to total revenue without the tariff, such excess 4 revenue may be retained by the utility. 5 c. (1) A public utilityâs participation under this 6 subsection is not mandatory. A public utility that elects to 7 propose a tariff or tariff amendment under this subsection 8 shall file an application for approval with the commission. 9 The application shall include an identification of costs and 10 benefits related to the program for the commissionâs review of 11 the conditions specified in paragraph âbâ , subparagraph (1). 12 (2) Within thirty days, the commission shall approve, deny, 13 or docket for further review an application for a tariff or 14 amended tariff submitted pursuant to this subsection. If the 15 application is docketed for further review, the commission 16 shall render a decision within ninety days from the date of 17 application filing unless an objection has been filed with the 18 commission. If the application proposes to amend a tariff 19 previously approved under this subsection, the commission shall 20 not reconsider existing programs previously approved under the 21 tariff unless proposed as part of the amendment.

Negative impacts include additional costs incurred 11 by nonparticipating customers due to costs arising from the 12 tariff, tariff participants no longer sharing in customer 13 class costs, or decreased customer benefit from existing 14 infrastructure. 15 Division II of the bill explains that a tariff may include 16 provisions relating to recovery of costs, rate of return, 17 application of the program to other specified patterns, program 18 benefits, and refunds, credits, or waivers when the program 19 replaces an existing service, or recovery of costs associated 20 with existing facilities. A participating program customer 21 shall pay the costs of the services received from the public 22 utility unless the costs are refunded, credited, or waived 23 under the program. Division II of the bill provides that 24 if the program or eligible customer group cease to exist and 25 the public utility seeks recovery of the program-specific 26 facilities through a general rate case proceeding, the public 27 utility shall demonstrate the reasonableness and prudence 28 without any presumption regarding approval of such request. A 29 public utility shall be allowed to recover program-specific 30 facilities through general rate case proceedings. If the 31 utility can demonstrate to the commission that the proposed 32 tariff generates excess revenue for the utility as compared to 33 total revenue without the tariff, the excess revenue may be 34 retained by the utility. 35 -40- LSB 1121XL (9) 91 sb/js 40/ 53 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ Division II of the bill provides for tariff application 1 and approval.
