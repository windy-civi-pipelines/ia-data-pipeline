Code 4 section 331.423 establishes a levy rate limitation for the 5 general county services levy and a limitation for the rural 6 county services levy. The bill modifies the general county 7 services levy rate limitation for fiscal years beginning on or 8 after July 1, 2026, but before July 1, 2031, to be a levy rate 9 not to exceed a levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value equal to 10 1,000 multiplied by the quotient of 102 percent of the current 11 fiscal yearâs actual property tax dollars certified for levy 12 for general county services divided by the remainder of the 13 total assessed value used to calculate taxes for the budget 14 year minus value attributable to new valuation as defined in 15 the bill. 16 For each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2031, the 17 maximum levy rate is the levy rate imposed by the county for 18 the current fiscal year (immediately preceding fiscal year), 19 unless the total assessed value, excluding new valuation, 20 as defined in the bill, used to calculate taxes for general 21 county services for the budget year is equal to or exceeds 102 22 percent of the total assessed value used to calculate taxes for 23 general county services for the current fiscal year; then the 24 countyâs maximum levy rate for general county services shall 25 not exceed a levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value equal to 26 1,000 multiplied by the quotient of 102 percent of the current 27 fiscal yearâs actual property tax dollars certified for levy 28 for general county services divided by the remainder of the 29 total assessed value used to calculate taxes for the budget 30 year minus value attributable to new valuation as defined in 31 the bill. 32 The bill similarly modifies the maximum levy rate for rural 33 county services for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 34 2026. 35 -43- LSB 1550YC (1) 91 jm/md 43/ 52 H.F. _____ The division takes effect January 1, 2026, and applies to 1 county taxes and budgets for fiscal years beginning on or after 2 July 1, 2026. 3 DIVISION II ââ CITY PROPERTY TAXES AND BUDGETS. Code section 4 384.1 establishes the city general fund levy and limits on the 5 levy rate. The bill modifies the levy rate limit for fiscal 6 years beginning on or after July 1, 2026, but before July 1, 7 2031, not to exceed a levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value 8 equal to 1,000 multiplied by the quotient of 102 percent of the 9 current fiscal yearâs actual property tax dollars certified for 10 levy for city general services divided by the remainder of the 11 total assessed value used to calculate taxes for the budget 12 year minus value attributable to new valuation as defined in 13 the bill. For each fiscal year beginning on or after July 14 1, 2031, the maximum levy rate is the levy rate imposed by 15 the city for the current fiscal year (immediately preceding 16 fiscal year), unless the total assessed value, excluding new 17 valuation, as defined in the bill, used to calculate taxes for 18 the budget year is equal to or exceeds 102 percent of the total 19 assessed value used to calculate taxes for the current fiscal 20 year; then the cityâs maximum levy rate for general services 21 shall not exceed a levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value equal 22 to 1,000 multiplied by the quotient of 102 percent of the 23 current fiscal yearâs actual property tax dollars certified 24 for levy for general services divided by the remainder of the 25 total assessed value used to calculate taxes for the budget 26 year minus value attributable to new valuation as defined in 27 the bill. The bill also establishes a methodology to determine 28 a maximum levy rate for a city that is not imposing a general 29 fund levy in the current fiscal year. 30 The division takes effect January 1, 2026, and applies to 31 property taxes and budgets for fiscal years beginning on or 32 after July 1, 2026. 33 DIVISION III ââ SCHOOL TAXES AND BUDGETS. As part of 34 the state school foundation program, for school budget 35 -44- LSB 1550YC (1) 91 jm/md 44/ 52 H.F. _____ years beginning on or after July 1, 2022, Code section 257.1 1 establishes the regular program foundation base to be 88.4 2 percent of the regular program state cost per pupil. Beginning 3 with the budget year beginning July 1, 2026, the bill increases 4 that percentage each budget year until the percentage is 100 5 percent for budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2030. 6 Similarly, the bill increases the special education support 7 services foundation base percentage from 79 percent to 100 8 percent over the same period of budget years. 9 Code section 257.3 requires school districts to levy a 10 foundation property tax of $5.40 per $1,000 of assessed value 11 on all taxable property in the school district. The bill 12 reduces the foundation property tax levy rate over a period of 13 budget years starting with the budget year beginning July 1, 14 2026, until the levy rate is $2.97 per $1,000 of assessed value 15 for budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2030. 16 Code section 257.3 provides an exception to the foundation 17 property tax levy rate of $5.40 for those school districts that 18 have recently been reorganized. Such districts are provided 19 reduced foundation property tax levy rates for three years 20 following the reorganization. The bill adjusts those reduced 21 rates for reorganizations that take effect on or after July 22 1, 2026, to reflect the reductions made in the bill to the 23 foundation property tax levy imposed by school districts that 24 are not subject to a reorganization and eliminates certain 25 supplemental aid related to such reorganized school district 26 rates for budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2030. 27 The bill eliminates certain property tax adjustment aid 28 under Code section 257.15(2) and (3) for fiscal years beginning 29 on or after July 1, 2030. 30 The bill eliminates the $24 million general fund 31 appropriation for adjusted additional property tax levy aid 32 under Code section 257.15(4) for fiscal years beginning on 33 or after July 1, 2030. The bill also eliminates the annual 34 appropriation of the balance of the property tax equity and 35 -45- LSB 1550YC (1) 91 jm/md 45/ 52 H.F. _____ relief fund under Code section 257.16A for purposes designated 1 under Code section 257.15(4) and requires remaining moneys at 2 the end of a specified fiscal year to be transferred back to 3 the funds from which they were received. 4 The bill eliminates the payment of school district property 5 tax replacement payments for fiscal years beginning on or after 6 July 1, 2030. 7 The bill eliminates the annual appropriation of moneys in 8 the foundation base supplement fund for fiscal years beginning 9 on or after July 1, 2030, and requires the remaining moneys 10 at the end of a specified fiscal year to be transferred for 11 deposit in the secure an advanced vision for education fund. 12 The bill eliminates transfers from the secure an advanced 13 vision for education fund to the property tax equity and relief 14 fund and the foundation base supplement fund for fiscal years 15 beginning on or after July 1, 2030. 16 In Code chapters 425A (family farm tax credit) and 426 17 (agricultural land tax credit), the bill replaces references 18 to the school foundation property tax levy rate ($5.40) with 19 citations to the appropriate provision of the Code section 20 establishing the foundation property tax rate. 21 The bill requires each school district with an unexpended 22 fund balance in the districtâs management levy fund under 23 Code section 298A.3 at the conclusion of the fiscal year 24 beginning July 1, 2024, that exceeds an amount equal to the 25 total expenditures from the districtâs management fund for the 26 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024, to certify such unexpended 27 fund balance and expenditure amounts, including any reserved 28 or designated amounts in the fund and the purposes therefor, 29 to the school budget review committee by November 15, 2025. 30 The committee is then required to conduct a review of the 31 unexpended fund balances and expenditures of school district 32 management levy funds certified under the bill. By February 1, 33 2026, the committee shall make recommendations to the general 34 assembly for the establishing district management levy fund 35 -46- LSB 1550YC (1) 91 jm/md 46/ 52 H.F. _____ unexpended fund balance limitations for fiscal years beginning 1 on or after July 1, 2027, including recommendations for 2 limitations based on a percentage of the districtâs management 3 levy fund expenditures and recommendations for management levy 4 limitations and expenditure requirements for excess funds. 5 The bill also amends Code section 298.4 by providing that for 6 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2027, if a school 7 districtâs unexpended fund balance of the districtâs management 8 levy fund is equal to or exceeds a specified percentage of the 9 average annual expenditures from the districtâs management 10 levy fund for the three consecutive fiscal years immediately 11 preceding the base year, the board of directors may not certify 12 a district management levy for the fiscal year. Additionally, 13 if a school district is not prohibited from certifying a levy 14 under the bill, the maximum amount that the board of directors 15 may certify for levy under this Code section shall be an 16 amount equal to the remainder of a specified percentage of the 17 average annual expenditures from the districtâs management 18 levy fund for the three consecutive fiscal years immediately 19 preceding the base year minus the districtâs management levy 20 fund unexpended fund balance for the fiscal year preceding the 21 base year. 22 Except for the section of the division amending Code section 23 257.31, this division of the bill takes effect July 1, 2026. 24 DIVISION IV ââ PROPERTY VALUATIONS AND ASSESSMENT 25 LIMITATIONS. Code section 441.21 provides that the actual 26 value of agricultural property shall be determined on the 27 basis of productivity and net earning capacity and that any 28 formula or method employed to determine productivity and net 29 earning capacity of property shall be adopted in full by rule 30 of the department of revenue. The bill amends that provision 31 by specifying that for assessment years beginning on or after 32 January 1, 2026, structures on agricultural land constructed on 33 or after January 1, 2026, that are not agricultural dwellings 34 shall not be included in determination of productivity and net 35 -47- LSB 1550YC (1) 91 jm/md 47/ 52 H.F. _____ earning capacity of agricultural property and shall not be 1 allocated any portion of the total county productivity value 2 so determined. Such agricultural structures shall instead 3 be valued under Code section 441.21(2) and the structureâs 4 assessed value subject to taxation shall be equal to the 5 product of the structureâs value multiplied by the agricultural 6 factor, as determined in 701 IAC 102.3(2) or succeeding rule 7 of the department. 8 Code section 441.21(4) establishes the calculation for 9 assessment limitations (rollback) for residential property and 10 agricultural property. The bill strikes the calculation of 11 the residential property assessment limitation for assessment 12 years beginning on or after January 1, 2025, and strikes 13 the provision within the agricultural property assessment 14 limitation calculation that limits growth of residential or 15 agricultural property to the growth in the other classification 16 (ag-residential tie). The bill establishes a schedule of 17 assessment limitations for residential property that increases 18 year assessment year from the assessment year beginning January 19 1, 2025, until the assessment limitation reaches 100 percent 20 for assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2029. 21 By operation of the scheduled increases to the residential 22 property assessment limitation, the assessment limitation 23 applicable to that portion of commercial, industrial, and 24 railway property that is equal to or less than $150,000 is 25 also increased. During that period of scheduled increase, the 26 bill also increases the 90 percent assessment limitation on 27 the portion of commercial, industrial, and railway property 28 that exceeds $150,000 until that percentage is 100 percent. 29 The bill makes similar changes to other assessment limitations 30 applicable to other classifications of property, including 31 utility property. 32 The bill modifies provisions governing the calculation 33 of payments made to local governments under Code section 34 441.21(5)(e) that are made to replace property taxes due to the 35 -48- LSB 1550YC (1) 91 jm/md 48/ 52 H.F. _____ application of the residential property assessment limitation 1 to certain portions of commercial and industrial property 2 valuations and eliminates the appropriation for such payments 3 for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2030, due to 4 elimination of the assessment limitations. 5 DIVISION V ââ DISABLED VETERAN AND HOMESTEAD CREDITS AND 6 EXEMPTIONS. 7 HOMESTEAD CREDIT. Over a period of years, the bill replaces 8 the homestead property tax credit, other than the portion 9 of the credit provided to certain disabled veterans, with a 10 homestead property tax exemption. Currently, the homestead 11 credit is an amount equal to the levy on the first $4,850 12 of actual value for each homestead. For the assessment year 13 beginning January 1, 2026, the homestead credit equals the levy 14 on the first $3,640 of actual value. For the assessment year 15 beginning January 1, 2027, the homestead credit equals the levy 16 on the first $2,430 of actual value. For the assessment year 17 beginning January 1, 2028, the homestead credit equals the 18 levy on the first $1,220 of actual value. The bill eliminates 19 the homestead credit, other than the homestead credit reserved 20 for disabled veterans, commencing with the assessment year 21 beginning July 1, 2029. 22 HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION. The bill modifies the homestead 23 exemption by increasing the current $6,500 taxable value 24 exemption amount and eliminating the requirement that an owner 25 be 65 years of age or older. 26 For the assessment year beginning January 1, 2026, the 27 exemption amount increases to $4,680, except for owners 65 28 and older, who remain at $6,500. For the assessment year 29 beginning January 1, 2027, the exemption amount increases to 30 $10,500. For the assessment year beginning January 1, 2028, 31 the exemption amount increases to $18,500, and for assessment 32 years beginning on or after January 1, 2029, the exemption 33 amount is $25,000. 34 DISABLED VETERAN. The bill moves the disabled homestead 35 -49- LSB 1550YC (1) 91 jm/md 49/ 52 H.F. _____ credit from Code section 425.15 to Code section 425.1, and 1 makes changes to the scope of the disabled veteran homestead 2 credit for new applicants. Currently, a disabled veteran with 3 a 100 percent permanent and total disability rating receives 4 a homestead credit on the entire amount of tax levied on the 5 homestead. The bill specifies that a separate application 6 form is required to claim the disabled homestead credit. The 7 bill does not change the homestead credit for an eligible 8 disabled veteran who makes an application for the homestead 9 credit before July 1, 2025. For a disabled veteran who makes 10 an application for the homestead credit on or after July 1, 11 2025, the bill changes the definition to âhomesteadâ to exclude 12 appurtenances and limits the size of the homestead credit to 13 property on one-half acre. 14 REIMBURSEMENT. The state continues to reimburse local 15 governments for the homestead credit, as determined under the 16 bill, including the disabled veterans homestead credit under 17 the bill, but does not reimburse local governments for the 18 homestead exemption under current law and in the bill. 19 This division of the bill applies to assessment years 20 beginning on or after January 1, 2026. 21 DIVISION VI ââ MILITARY SERVICE PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION. 22 Under current law, a veteran receives a property tax exemption 23 of $4,000 in taxable value on property owned by the veteran. 24 The bill increases the veterans property tax exemption from 25 $4,000 to the following exemption amounts: for the assessment 26 year beginning January 1, 2025, $5,000; for the assessment 27 year beginning January 1, 2026, $6,000; for assessment years 28 beginning on or after January 1, 2027, $7,000. 29 The division applies retroactively to assessment years 30 beginning on or after January 1, 2025. 31 DIVISION VII ââ PROPERTY TAX LEVY RATES. The bill 32 establishes a reduction for rate-limited property tax levies. 33 The bill defines ârate-limited property tax levyâ to be any ad 34 valorem property tax levy limited by law to a specific property 35 -50- LSB 1550YC (1) 91 jm/md 50/ 52 H.F. _____ tax levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value used to calculate 1 taxes, but does not include the school district foundation levy 2 under Code section 257.3, the county general services levy 3 under Code section 331.423(1), the county rural services levy 4 under Code section 331.423(2), or the city general fund levy 5 under Code section 384.1(3). 6 For each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2026, 7 each rate-limited property tax levy may only be imposed if 8 the governmental entity imposed such levy for the fiscal year 9 beginning July 1, 2025, and shall, by operation of the bill, 10 be limited to a levy rate that is equal to 1,000 multiplied 11 by the quotient of 102 percent of the current fiscal yearâs 12 actual property tax dollars certified for such levy divided by 13 the total assessed value used to calculate such taxes for the 14 budget year. 15 The bill also provides that, on or after July 1, 2025, a city 16 or county shall not issue bonds or other indebtedness payable 17 from an ad valorem property tax levy for the purpose of funding 18 the general operations of the city or general operations of 19 the county, as applicable, or otherwise use proceeds from the 20 sale of bonds or issuance of other indebtedness to fund general 21 operations. The bill defines âgeneral operationsâ to mean 22 services or activities generally funded from the governmental 23 entityâs general fund, which are necessary for the operation 24 of the governmental entity, including salaries and benefits, 25 or which are for the health and welfare of the governmental 26 entityâs citizens or primarily intended to benefit all 27 residents of the governmental entity, but excluding services 28 financed by statutory funds other than a debt service fund. 29 The city finance committee is required to adopt rules under 30 Code chapter 17A for cities to implement the new Code section 31 governing funding of general operations. The county finance 32 committee is required to adopt rules under chapter 17A for 33 counties to implement the new Code section governing funding 34 of general operations. 35 -51- LSB 1550YC (1) 91 jm/md 51/ 52 H.F. _____ DIVISION VIII ââ ELDERLY PROPERTY TAXES ââ LOW INCOME. The 1 bill modifies the eligibility for the property tax credit for 2 persons ages 70 and older under Code chapter 425, subchapter 3 II. Currently, a person filing a claim for the property tax 4 credit who is at least 70 years of age and who has a household 5 income of less than 250 percent of the federal poverty level is 6 eligible to receive a specified credit amount against property 7 taxes due on the claimantâs homestead. The bill increases the 8 household income threshold for eligibility from less than 250 9 percent of the federal poverty level to less than 350 percent 10 of the federal poverty level. 11 The division applies to assessment years beginning on or 12 after January 1, 2026. 13 DIVISION IX ââ BRUCELLOSIS AND TUBERCULOSIS ERADICATION 14 FUND ââ LEVY. Code section 165.18 authorizes the secretary of 15 agriculture to direct the board of supervisors of each county 16 to levy an amount sufficient to pay the expenses estimated to 17 be incurred from the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication 18 fund for the following fiscal year, subject to a maximum levy 19 of 33.75 cents per $1,000. The bill strikes the authority to 20 levy such a tax beginning with property taxes due and payable 21 in fiscal years beginning July 1, 2025. 22 -52- LSB 1550YC (1) 91 jm/md 52/ 52

Code 4 section 331.423 establishes a levy rate limitation for the 5 general county services levy and a limitation for the rural 6 county services levy. The bill modifies the general county 7 services levy rate limitation for fiscal years beginning on or 8 after July 1, 2026, but before July 1, 2031, to be a levy rate 9 not to exceed a levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value equal to 10 1,000 multiplied by the quotient of 102 percent of the current 11 fiscal yearâs actual property tax dollars certified for levy 12 for general county services divided by the remainder of the 13 total assessed value used to calculate taxes for the budget 14 year minus value attributable to new valuation as defined in 15 the bill. 16 For each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2031, the 17 maximum levy rate is the levy rate imposed by the county for 18 the current fiscal year (immediately preceding fiscal year), 19 unless the total assessed value, excluding new valuation, 20 as defined in the bill, used to calculate taxes for general 21 county services for the budget year is equal to or exceeds 102 22 percent of the total assessed value used to calculate taxes for 23 general county services for the current fiscal year; then the 24 countyâs maximum levy rate for general county services shall 25 not exceed a levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value equal to 26 1,000 multiplied by the quotient of 102 percent of the current 27 fiscal yearâs actual property tax dollars certified for levy 28 for general county services divided by the remainder of the 29 total assessed value used to calculate taxes for the budget 30 year minus value attributable to new valuation as defined in 31 the bill. 32 The bill similarly modifies the maximum levy rate for rural 33 county services for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 34 2026. 35 -43- LSB 1550YC (1) 91 jm/md 43/ 52 H.F. _____ The division takes effect January 1, 2026, and applies to 1 county taxes and budgets for fiscal years beginning on or after 2 July 1, 2026. 3 DIVISION II ââ CITY PROPERTY TAXES AND BUDGETS. Code section 4 384.1 establishes the city general fund levy and limits on the 5 levy rate. The bill modifies the levy rate limit for fiscal 6 years beginning on or after July 1, 2026, but before July 1, 7 2031, not to exceed a levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value 8 equal to 1,000 multiplied by the quotient of 102 percent of the 9 current fiscal yearâs actual property tax dollars certified for 10 levy for city general services divided by the remainder of the 11 total assessed value used to calculate taxes for the budget 12 year minus value attributable to new valuation as defined in 13 the bill. For each fiscal year beginning on or after July 14 1, 2031, the maximum levy rate is the levy rate imposed by 15 the city for the current fiscal year (immediately preceding 16 fiscal year), unless the total assessed value, excluding new 17 valuation, as defined in the bill, used to calculate taxes for 18 the budget year is equal to or exceeds 102 percent of the total 19 assessed value used to calculate taxes for the current fiscal 20 year; then the cityâs maximum levy rate for general services 21 shall not exceed a levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value equal 22 to 1,000 multiplied by the quotient of 102 percent of the 23 current fiscal yearâs actual property tax dollars certified 24 for levy for general services divided by the remainder of the 25 total assessed value used to calculate taxes for the budget 26 year minus value attributable to new valuation as defined in 27 the bill. The bill also establishes a methodology to determine 28 a maximum levy rate for a city that is not imposing a general 29 fund levy in the current fiscal year. 30 The division takes effect January 1, 2026, and applies to 31 property taxes and budgets for fiscal years beginning on or 32 after July 1, 2026. 33 DIVISION III ââ SCHOOL TAXES AND BUDGETS. As part of 34 the state school foundation program, for school budget 35 -44- LSB 1550YC (1) 91 jm/md 44/ 52 H.F. _____ years beginning on or after July 1, 2022, Code section 257.1 1 establishes the regular program foundation base to be 88.4 2 percent of the regular program state cost per pupil. Beginning 3 with the budget year beginning July 1, 2026, the bill increases 4 that percentage each budget year until the percentage is 100 5 percent for budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2030. 6 Similarly, the bill increases the special education support 7 services foundation base percentage from 79 percent to 100 8 percent over the same period of budget years. 9 Code section 257.3 requires school districts to levy a 10 foundation property tax of $5.40 per $1,000 of assessed value 11 on all taxable property in the school district. The bill 12 reduces the foundation property tax levy rate over a period of 13 budget years starting with the budget year beginning July 1, 14 2026, until the levy rate is $2.97 per $1,000 of assessed value 15 for budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2030. 16 Code section 257.3 provides an exception to the foundation 17 property tax levy rate of $5.40 for those school districts that 18 have recently been reorganized. Such districts are provided 19 reduced foundation property tax levy rates for three years 20 following the reorganization. The bill adjusts those reduced 21 rates for reorganizations that take effect on or after July 22 1, 2026, to reflect the reductions made in the bill to the 23 foundation property tax levy imposed by school districts that 24 are not subject to a reorganization and eliminates certain 25 supplemental aid related to such reorganized school district 26 rates for budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2030. 27 The bill eliminates certain property tax adjustment aid 28 under Code section 257.15(2) and (3) for fiscal years beginning 29 on or after July 1, 2030. 30 The bill eliminates the $24 million general fund 31 appropriation for adjusted additional property tax levy aid 32 under Code section 257.15(4) for fiscal years beginning on 33 or after July 1, 2030. The bill also eliminates the annual 34 appropriation of the balance of the property tax equity and 35 -45- LSB 1550YC (1) 91 jm/md 45/ 52 H.F. _____ relief fund under Code section 257.16A for purposes designated 1 under Code section 257.15(4) and requires remaining moneys at 2 the end of a specified fiscal year to be transferred back to 3 the funds from which they were received. 4 The bill eliminates the payment of school district property 5 tax replacement payments for fiscal years beginning on or after 6 July 1, 2030. 7 The bill eliminates the annual appropriation of moneys in 8 the foundation base supplement fund for fiscal years beginning 9 on or after July 1, 2030, and requires the remaining moneys 10 at the end of a specified fiscal year to be transferred for 11 deposit in the secure an advanced vision for education fund. 12 The bill eliminates transfers from the secure an advanced 13 vision for education fund to the property tax equity and relief 14 fund and the foundation base supplement fund for fiscal years 15 beginning on or after July 1, 2030. 16 In Code chapters 425A (family farm tax credit) and 426 17 (agricultural land tax credit), the bill replaces references 18 to the school foundation property tax levy rate ($5.40) with 19 citations to the appropriate provision of the Code section 20 establishing the foundation property tax rate. 21 The bill requires each school district with an unexpended 22 fund balance in the districtâs management levy fund under 23 Code section 298A.3 at the conclusion of the fiscal year 24 beginning July 1, 2024, that exceeds an amount equal to the 25 total expenditures from the districtâs management fund for the 26 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024, to certify such unexpended 27 fund balance and expenditure amounts, including any reserved 28 or designated amounts in the fund and the purposes therefor, 29 to the school budget review committee by November 15, 2025. 30 The committee is then required to conduct a review of the 31 unexpended fund balances and expenditures of school district 32 management levy funds certified under the bill. By February 1, 33 2026, the committee shall make recommendations to the general 34 assembly for the establishing district management levy fund 35 -46- LSB 1550YC (1) 91 jm/md 46/ 52 H.F. _____ unexpended fund balance limitations for fiscal years beginning 1 on or after July 1, 2027, including recommendations for 2 limitations based on a percentage of the districtâs management 3 levy fund expenditures and recommendations for management levy 4 limitations and expenditure requirements for excess funds. 5 The bill also amends Code section 298.4 by providing that for 6 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2027, if a school 7 districtâs unexpended fund balance of the districtâs management 8 levy fund is equal to or exceeds a specified percentage of the 9 average annual expenditures from the districtâs management 10 levy fund for the three consecutive fiscal years immediately 11 preceding the base year, the board of directors may not certify 12 a district management levy for the fiscal year. Additionally, 13 if a school district is not prohibited from certifying a levy 14 under the bill, the maximum amount that the board of directors 15 may certify for levy under this Code section shall be an 16 amount equal to the remainder of a specified percentage of the 17 average annual expenditures from the districtâs management 18 levy fund for the three consecutive fiscal years immediately 19 preceding the base year minus the districtâs management levy 20 fund unexpended fund balance for the fiscal year preceding the 21 base year. 22 Except for the section of the division amending Code section 23 257.31, this division of the bill takes effect July 1, 2026. 24 DIVISION IV ââ PROPERTY VALUATIONS AND ASSESSMENT 25 LIMITATIONS. Code section 441.21 provides that the actual 26 value of agricultural property shall be determined on the 27 basis of productivity and net earning capacity and that any 28 formula or method employed to determine productivity and net 29 earning capacity of property shall be adopted in full by rule 30 of the department of revenue. The bill amends that provision 31 by specifying that for assessment years beginning on or after 32 January 1, 2026, structures on agricultural land constructed on 33 or after January 1, 2026, that are not agricultural dwellings 34 shall not be included in determination of productivity and net 35 -47- LSB 1550YC (1) 91 jm/md 47/ 52 H.F. _____ earning capacity of agricultural property and shall not be 1 allocated any portion of the total county productivity value 2 so determined. Such agricultural structures shall instead 3 be valued under Code section 441.21(2) and the structureâs 4 assessed value subject to taxation shall be equal to the 5 product of the structureâs value multiplied by the agricultural 6 factor, as determined in 701 IAC 102.3(2) or succeeding rule 7 of the department. 8 Code section 441.21(4) establishes the calculation for 9 assessment limitations (rollback) for residential property and 10 agricultural property. The bill strikes the calculation of 11 the residential property assessment limitation for assessment 12 years beginning on or after January 1, 2025, and strikes 13 the provision within the agricultural property assessment 14 limitation calculation that limits growth of residential or 15 agricultural property to the growth in the other classification 16 (ag-residential tie). The bill establishes a schedule of 17 assessment limitations for residential property that increases 18 year assessment year from the assessment year beginning January 19 1, 2025, until the assessment limitation reaches 100 percent 20 for assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2029. 21 By operation of the scheduled increases to the residential 22 property assessment limitation, the assessment limitation 23 applicable to that portion of commercial, industrial, and 24 railway property that is equal to or less than $150,000 is 25 also increased. During that period of scheduled increase, the 26 bill also increases the 90 percent assessment limitation on 27 the portion of commercial, industrial, and railway property 28 that exceeds $150,000 until that percentage is 100 percent. 29 The bill makes similar changes to other assessment limitations 30 applicable to other classifications of property, including 31 utility property. 32 The bill modifies provisions governing the calculation 33 of payments made to local governments under Code section 34 441.21(5)(e) that are made to replace property taxes due to the 35 -48- LSB 1550YC (1) 91 jm/md 48/ 52 H.F. _____ application of the residential property assessment limitation 1 to certain portions of commercial and industrial property 2 valuations and eliminates the appropriation for such payments 3 for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2030, due to 4 elimination of the assessment limitations. 5 DIVISION V ââ DISABLED VETERAN AND HOMESTEAD CREDITS AND 6 EXEMPTIONS. 7 HOMESTEAD CREDIT. Over a period of years, the bill replaces 8 the homestead property tax credit, other than the portion 9 of the credit provided to certain disabled veterans, with a 10 homestead property tax exemption. Currently, the homestead 11 credit is an amount equal to the levy on the first $4,850 12 of actual value for each homestead. For the assessment year 13 beginning January 1, 2026, the homestead credit equals the levy 14 on the first $3,640 of actual value. For the assessment year 15 beginning January 1, 2027, the homestead credit equals the levy 16 on the first $2,430 of actual value. For the assessment year 17 beginning January 1, 2028, the homestead credit equals the 18 levy on the first $1,220 of actual value. The bill eliminates 19 the homestead credit, other than the homestead credit reserved 20 for disabled veterans, commencing with the assessment year 21 beginning July 1, 2029. 22 HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION. The bill modifies the homestead 23 exemption by increasing the current $6,500 taxable value 24 exemption amount and eliminating the requirement that an owner 25 be 65 years of age or older. 26 For the assessment year beginning January 1, 2026, the 27 exemption amount increases to $4,680, except for owners 65 28 and older, who remain at $6,500. For the assessment year 29 beginning January 1, 2027, the exemption amount increases to 30 $10,500. For the assessment year beginning January 1, 2028, 31 the exemption amount increases to $18,500, and for assessment 32 years beginning on or after January 1, 2029, the exemption 33 amount is $25,000. 34 DISABLED VETERAN. The bill moves the disabled homestead 35 -49- LSB 1550YC (1) 91 jm/md 49/ 52 H.F. _____ credit from Code section 425.15 to Code section 425.1, and 1 makes changes to the scope of the disabled veteran homestead 2 credit for new applicants. Currently, a disabled veteran with 3 a 100 percent permanent and total disability rating receives 4 a homestead credit on the entire amount of tax levied on the 5 homestead. The bill specifies that a separate application 6 form is required to claim the disabled homestead credit. The 7 bill does not change the homestead credit for an eligible 8 disabled veteran who makes an application for the homestead 9 credit before July 1, 2025. For a disabled veteran who makes 10 an application for the homestead credit on or after July 1, 11 2025, the bill changes the definition to âhomesteadâ to exclude 12 appurtenances and limits the size of the homestead credit to 13 property on one-half acre. 14 REIMBURSEMENT. The state continues to reimburse local 15 governments for the homestead credit, as determined under the 16 bill, including the disabled veterans homestead credit under 17 the bill, but does not reimburse local governments for the 18 homestead exemption under current law and in the bill. 19 This division of the bill applies to assessment years 20 beginning on or after January 1, 2026. 21 DIVISION VI ââ MILITARY SERVICE PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION. 22 Under current law, a veteran receives a property tax exemption 23 of $4,000 in taxable value on property owned by the veteran. 24 The bill increases the veterans property tax exemption from 25 $4,000 to the following exemption amounts: for the assessment 26 year beginning January 1, 2025, $5,000; for the assessment 27 year beginning January 1, 2026, $6,000; for assessment years 28 beginning on or after January 1, 2027, $7,000. 29 The division applies retroactively to assessment years 30 beginning on or after January 1, 2025. 31 DIVISION VII ââ PROPERTY TAX LEVY RATES. The bill 32 establishes a reduction for rate-limited property tax levies. 33 The bill defines ârate-limited property tax levyâ to be any ad 34 valorem property tax levy limited by law to a specific property 35 -50- LSB 1550YC (1) 91 jm/md 50/ 52 H.F. _____ tax levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value used to calculate 1 taxes, but does not include the school district foundation levy 2 under Code section 257.3, the county general services levy 3 under Code section 331.423(1), the county rural services levy 4 under Code section 331.423(2), or the city general fund levy 5 under Code section 384.1(3). 6 For each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2026, 7 each rate-limited property tax levy may only be imposed if 8 the governmental entity imposed such levy for the fiscal year 9 beginning July 1, 2025, and shall, by operation of the bill, 10 be limited to a levy rate that is equal to 1,000 multiplied 11 by the quotient of 102 percent of the current fiscal yearâs 12 actual property tax dollars certified for such levy divided by 13 the total assessed value used to calculate such taxes for the 14 budget year. 15 The bill also provides that, on or after July 1, 2025, a city 16 or county shall not issue bonds or other indebtedness payable 17 from an ad valorem property tax levy for the purpose of funding 18 the general operations of the city or general operations of 19 the county, as applicable, or otherwise use proceeds from the 20 sale of bonds or issuance of other indebtedness to fund general 21 operations. The bill defines âgeneral operationsâ to mean 22 services or activities generally funded from the governmental 23 entityâs general fund, which are necessary for the operation 24 of the governmental entity, including salaries and benefits, 25 or which are for the health and welfare of the governmental 26 entityâs citizens or primarily intended to benefit all 27 residents of the governmental entity, but excluding services 28 financed by statutory funds other than a debt service fund. 29 The city finance committee is required to adopt rules under 30 Code chapter 17A for cities to implement the new Code section 31 governing funding of general operations. The county finance 32 committee is required to adopt rules under chapter 17A for 33 counties to implement the new Code section governing funding 34 of general operations. 35 -51- LSB 1550YC (1) 91 jm/md 51/ 52 H.F. _____ DIVISION VIII ââ ELDERLY PROPERTY TAXES ââ LOW INCOME. The 1 bill modifies the eligibility for the property tax credit for 2 persons ages 70 and older under Code chapter 425, subchapter 3 II. Currently, a person filing a claim for the property tax 4 credit who is at least 70 years of age and who has a household 5 income of less than 250 percent of the federal poverty level is 6 eligible to receive a specified credit amount against property 7 taxes due on the claimantâs homestead. The bill increases the 8 household income threshold for eligibility from less than 250 9 percent of the federal poverty level to less than 350 percent 10 of the federal poverty level. 11 The division applies to assessment years beginning on or 12 after January 1, 2026. 13 DIVISION IX ââ BRUCELLOSIS AND TUBERCULOSIS ERADICATION 14 FUND ââ LEVY. Code section 165.18 authorizes the secretary of 15 agriculture to direct the board of supervisors of each county 16 to levy an amount sufficient to pay the expenses estimated to 17 be incurred from the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication 18 fund for the following fiscal year, subject to a maximum levy 19 of 33.75 cents per $1,000. The bill strikes the authority to 20 levy such a tax beginning with property taxes due and payable 21 in fiscal years beginning July 1, 2025. 22 -52- LSB 1550YC (1) 91 jm/md 52/ 52
