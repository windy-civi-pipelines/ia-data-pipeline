Therefore, 22 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state 23 mandate included in the bill. 24 -10- LSB 1997YH (5) 91 je/jh 10/ 10

The bill defines a âpublic 22 institution of higher educationâ as an institution of higher 23 education governed by the state board of regents or a community 24 college. 25 The bill requires public institutions of higher education 26 (institutions) to carry out various specified functions to 27 raise mental health awareness on their campuses. Specified 28 functions include developing and implementing an annual 29 student orientation session aimed at raising awareness about 30 mental health conditions, assessing courses and seminars 31 available to students through their regular academic coursework 32 and implementing mental health awareness curricula where 33 opportunities for integration with such coursework exist, and 34 distributing certain information about mental health resources 35 -8- LSB 1997YH (5) 91 je/jh 8/ 10 H.F. 665 to students. 1 The bill requires the state board of regents and the 2 board of directors of each community college to designate an 3 expert panel to develop and implement specified policies and 4 procedures relating to mental health. Specified policies and 5 procedures include advising students, faculty, and staff on 6 the proper procedures for identifying and addressing the needs 7 of students exhibiting symptoms of mental health conditions 8 and promoting understanding of the requirements of section 9 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the federal 10 Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The bill also 11 requires all resident assistants in a student housing facility, 12 advisors, and campus security officers of an institution to 13 participate in a national mental health first aid training 14 course. 15 The bill requires each institution to develop and implement 16 a peer support program utilizing student peers to support 17 students living with mental health conditions on campus. The 18 bill requires peer support programs to utilize best practices 19 for peer support. Such best practices include use of the 20 tenets of the recovery model, as defined in the bill, for 21 mental health, adequate planning and preparation, and clearly 22 articulated policies. 23 The bill requires each institution to establish strategic 24 partnerships with local mental health service providers to 25 improve overall campus mental wellness and augment on-campus 26 capacity. The strategic partnerships shall include linkage 27 agreements, as defined in the bill, with off-campus mental 28 health service providers that establish a process for referrals 29 for students when needs cannot be met on campus due to the 30 limits of on-campus capacity or preference of the student. 31 The bill provides additional functions of such strategic 32 partnerships, including meeting a benchmark ratio of clinical, 33 nonstudent staff members to students and reporting on the ratio 34 to the general assembly and the governor. 35 -9- LSB 1997YH (5) 91 je/jh 9/ 10 H.F. 665 The bill requires the department of health and human 1 services, in consultation with the state board of regents and 2 the Iowa association for community colleges, to establish 3 a mental health technical assistance center. The bill 4 specifies responsibilities of the center, including developing 5 standardized policies for medical leave related to mental 6 health conditions for students, providing tailored support 7 to institutions in reviewing policies related to students 8 living with mental health conditions and their academic 9 standing, and developing statewide standards and best practices 10 for partnerships between local mental health agencies and 11 institutions. The center also assists institutions with 12 implementation of various provisions of the bill. 13 The bill requires each institution to evaluate the specified 14 programs or functions provided in the bill for effectiveness 15 and quality. The bill specifies monitoring measures to be used 16 for evaluation of each program or function. 17 The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code 18 section 25B.3. The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2, 19 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from 20 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of 21 the state mandate is not provided or specified. Therefore, 22 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state 23 mandate included in the bill. 24 -10- LSB 1997YH (5) 91 je/jh 10/ 10
