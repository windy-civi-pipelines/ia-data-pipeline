Section 25B.2, subsection 24 3, shall not apply to this Act. 25 Sec. 15. EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT. This Act, being deemed 26 of immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment. 27 EXPLANATION 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 29 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 30 This bill provides for the registration of eligible electors 31 upon review of electronic records received from state agencies. 32 The bill allows for registration of eligible electors 33 to vote following review of electronic records received 34 from driverâs license and nonoperatorâs identification card 35 -8- LSB 2034YH (4) 91 ss/ns 8/ 11 H.F. 290 applications by county commissioners of registration (county 1 auditors). 2 The bill requires that the office of driver services of the 3 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of 4 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing 5 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information 6 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting 7 an application for a driverâs license or nonoperatorâs 8 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code 9 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license 10 or card include an applicantâs full name, signature, current 11 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth, 12 social security number, and other information. Under current 13 administrative rules of the state department of transportation, 14 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof 15 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current 16 administrative rules, a personâs signature for a driverâs 17 license or nonoperatorâs identification card application is 18 required to be captured electronically. Under current law, 19 a county treasurerâs office participating in county issuance 20 of driverâs licenses is required to participate in voter 21 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the 22 state department of transportation. 23 The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit 24 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county 25 commissioner of registration of the county where the person 26 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review 27 the electronic record and any other relevant information to 28 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county 29 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector 30 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the 31 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the 32 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare 33 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to 34 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county 35 -9- LSB 2034YH (4) 91 ss/ns 9/ 11 H.F. 290 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that 1 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute 2 a completed voter registration form for that person and the 3 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to 4 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as 5 required by current law. 6 The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a 7 personâs name to a voter registration list until at least 21 8 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the 9 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an 10 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of 11 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides 12 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person 13 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute 14 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a 15 person submitting an application for a license or card will not 16 be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under Code 17 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application. 18 The bill also grants the state voter registration commission 19 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the 20 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor 21 vehicle driverâs license stations. If interpretive rulemaking 22 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by 23 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether 24 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly 25 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section 26 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not 27 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable 28 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an 29 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)). 30 The bill makes changes to current law related to address 31 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter 32 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for 33 administration of registration for those participants. The 34 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper 35 -10- LSB 2034YH (4) 91 ss/ns 10/ 11 H.F. 290 voter registration form through driverâs license offices. The 1 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration 2 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to 3 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driverâs license 4 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms 5 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all 6 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state 7 registrar of voters. 8 Under current law, the state registrar of voters is 9 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter 10 registration forms from driverâs license stations and voter 11 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required 12 to be established by the state commission. 13 The bill also allows for automatic voter registration 14 to be completed based upon information received from 15 voter registration agencies, including, under the bill, 16 the department of education and other state offices that 17 collect personal information sufficient to complete a voter 18 registration application. 19 The bill provides that the state voter registration 20 commission, in consultation with the department of 21 transportation and voter registration agencies, may adopt 22 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill. 23 The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code 24 section 25B.3. The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25 25B.2(3), which would relieve a political subdivision from 26 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of 27 the state mandate is not provided or specified. Therefore, 28 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state 29 mandate included in the bill. 30 The bill takes effect upon enactment. 31 -11- LSB 2034YH (4) 91 ss/ns 11/ 11

This Act, being deemed 26 of immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment. 27 EXPLANATION 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 29 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 30 This bill provides for the registration of eligible electors 31 upon review of electronic records received from state agencies. 32 The bill allows for registration of eligible electors 33 to vote following review of electronic records received 34 from driverâs license and nonoperatorâs identification card 35 -8- LSB 2034YH (4) 91 ss/ns 8/ 11 H.F. 290 applications by county commissioners of registration (county 1 auditors). 2 The bill requires that the office of driver services of the 3 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of 4 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing 5 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information 6 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting 7 an application for a driverâs license or nonoperatorâs 8 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code 9 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license 10 or card include an applicantâs full name, signature, current 11 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth, 12 social security number, and other information. Under current 13 administrative rules of the state department of transportation, 14 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof 15 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current 16 administrative rules, a personâs signature for a driverâs 17 license or nonoperatorâs identification card application is 18 required to be captured electronically. Under current law, 19 a county treasurerâs office participating in county issuance 20 of driverâs licenses is required to participate in voter 21 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the 22 state department of transportation. 23 The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit 24 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county 25 commissioner of registration of the county where the person 26 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review 27 the electronic record and any other relevant information to 28 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county 29 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector 30 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the 31 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the 32 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare 33 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to 34 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county 35 -9- LSB 2034YH (4) 91 ss/ns 9/ 11 H.F. 290 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that 1 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute 2 a completed voter registration form for that person and the 3 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to 4 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as 5 required by current law. 6 The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a 7 personâs name to a voter registration list until at least 21 8 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the 9 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an 10 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of 11 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides 12 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person 13 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute 14 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a 15 person submitting an application for a license or card will not 16 be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under Code 17 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application. 18 The bill also grants the state voter registration commission 19 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the 20 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor 21 vehicle driverâs license stations. If interpretive rulemaking 22 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by 23 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether 24 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly 25 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section 26 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not 27 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable 28 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an 29 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)). 30 The bill makes changes to current law related to address 31 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter 32 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for 33 administration of registration for those participants. The 34 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper 35 -10- LSB 2034YH (4) 91 ss/ns 10/ 11 H.F. 290 voter registration form through driverâs license offices. The 1 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration 2 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to 3 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driverâs license 4 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms 5 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all 6 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state 7 registrar of voters. 8 Under current law, the state registrar of voters is 9 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter 10 registration forms from driverâs license stations and voter 11 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required 12 to be established by the state commission. 13 The bill also allows for automatic voter registration 14 to be completed based upon information received from 15 voter registration agencies, including, under the bill, 16 the department of education and other state offices that 17 collect personal information sufficient to complete a voter 18 registration application. 19 The bill provides that the state voter registration 20 commission, in consultation with the department of 21 transportation and voter registration agencies, may adopt 22 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill. 23 The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code 24 section 25B.3. The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25 25B.2(3), which would relieve a political subdivision from 26 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of 27 the state mandate is not provided or specified. Therefore, 28 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state 29 mandate included in the bill. 30 The bill takes effect upon enactment. 31 -11- LSB 2034YH (4) 91 ss/ns 11/ 11
