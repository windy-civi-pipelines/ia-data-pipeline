EFFECTIVE DATE. The following takes effect January 9 1, 2026: 10 The portion of the section of this Act amending section 11 331.606, subsection 1. 12 EXPLANATION 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 14 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 15 This bill relates to certain required document criteria to 16 file documents and instruments with county recorders, fees 17 paid for recording documents, funds created for recorders and 18 the electronic services system and associated authorization 19 for spending moneys in those funds for certain purposes, the 20 creation of the electronic services system, organized by 21 an agreement pursuant to Code chapter 28E (28E agreement), 22 and the electronic filing system used to accept, manage, 23 and make available county recorder filings electronically. 24 Under current law, county recorders are required to execute 25 a 28E agreement with other counties to implement a county 26 land record information system in accordance with 2005 Iowa 27 Acts, chapter 179, section 101, subsection 1, as amended by 28 2021 Iowa Acts, chapter 126, section 2. The bill amends this 29 provision to require county recorders to enter into a 28E 30 agreement to create and implement the electronic services 31 system, a statewide electronic county land record information 32 system. The bill defines âelectronic services systemâ as the 33 organization formed under the 28E agreement. The electronic 34 services system is also the name of the actual electronic 35 -16- LSB 1517XS (3) 91 ll/js 16/ 20 S.F. 371 system implemented to accept, manage, and make available 1 records filed with a county recorder. 2 Several sections of Code chapter 331, subchapter V, 3 part 3, pertaining to the county recorder are amended to 4 specify certain requirements for documents or instruments 5 submitted to a county recorder for filing either in person 6 or electronically. Many of these requirements pertain to 7 required recording references, indexing, formatting, text, 8 margin sizes, and document size limitations with an emphasis on 9 legibility. References to the county land record information 10 system are removed throughout Code chapter 331 and replaced 11 with âelectronic services systemâ. 12 Under current law, in addition to the $5 county recorders 13 collect for each page of a document or instrument filed in 14 the county recorderâs office, $1 is collected for the county 15 recorderâs records management fund, and $1 is collected for 16 the county recorderâs electronic transaction fund. The bill 17 changes the fees to a flat fee of $10 for each page filed or 18 recorded in the recorderâs office, with a maximum recording fee 19 of $500 for 50 or more pages filed. From the total fee of $10 20 per page of a document or instrument filed with a recorder, $2 21 is transferred to the recorderâs technology advancement fund 22 and $3 is transferred to the recorderâs electronic services 23 system fund. 24 The bill eliminates the county recorderâs records management 25 funds and creates recorderâs technology advancement funds to 26 be used for the following purposes: maintaining and improving 27 equipment, software, and systems; preserving and maintaining 28 archived physical and electronic documents or instruments; 29 converting physical documents to electronic documents; and 30 education and training for advancing technology. The bill 31 eliminates the county recorderâs electronic transaction funds 32 and creates recorderâs electronic services funds. By the first 33 day of each month, the treasurer shall transfer the moneys 34 deposited into the recorderâs electronic services system fund 35 -17- LSB 1517XS (3) 91 ll/js 17/ 20 S.F. 371 to an account in a financial institution designated by the 1 governing board of the electronic services system to be used 2 as outlined in new Code section 331.605B for the following 3 purposes: to enable electronic filing for recording documents; 4 to provide electronic access to recorded public documents; to 5 receive electronic payments to process electronic documents 6 for recording; to implement security and redaction systems to 7 protect personally identifiable information; to integrate with 8 other appropriate real property filing or management systems; 9 to establish standards for processing, recording, indexing, 10 accessing, and archiving documents for electronic county land 11 record management systems; and to develop a notification system 12 for users when electronic filings or records are associated 13 with the userâs name, property, or other recorded filing 14 information. The recorder or the electronic services system 15 shall make available any information required by the county 16 auditor or auditor of state concerning the moneys collected 17 from fees and the uses for which such fees are expended. 18 The county treasurer must transfer moneys remaining in the 19 county recorderâs records management fund to the recorderâs 20 technology advancement fund and moneys remaining in the county 21 recorderâs electronic transaction fund to the recorderâs 22 electronic services fund on the effective date of the bill. 23 The bill provides that any moneys remaining in the local 24 government electronic transaction fund after the effective date 25 of the bill are appropriated to the treasurer of state to be 26 used by the treasurer of state to assist the governing board of 27 the electronic services system in accomplishing the purposes 28 stated in Code section 331.605B(1). 29 The electronic services system may collect a fee of not more 30 than $3 per recorded document, along with any service charges 31 associated with a credit or debit card payment, to receive and 32 process a document or instrument. Moneys collected from these 33 fees by the electronic services system must be used for the 34 same purposes as the recorderâs electronic services fund. The 35 -18- LSB 1517XS (3) 91 ll/js 18/ 20 S.F. 371 electronic services system cannot charge a fee for viewing, 1 accessing, or printing records and cannot provide access to 2 records on a batch basis. 3 The bill limits tort liability of government subdivisions 4 by excluding contractors hired by the governing board of the 5 electronic services systems from government employees. 6 The bill creates a process for a county recorder to decline 7 acceptance of a physical or electronic document and to provide 8 information to the filer to correct the defect. A recorderâs 9 ability to collect an additional recording fee of $10 per 10 document to accept nonconforming documents is eliminated. 11 The information required to be included by a recorder 12 who is filing and indexing documents or instruments into the 13 electronic county land record management system is outlined 14 and includes how reference numbers must be determined and 15 applied to filings each calendar year, the use of only numeric 16 references containing no more than six digits preceded by 17 a county two-digit code and four-digit year, and indexing 18 requirements for certain recorded documents associated with 19 the recording. Additionally, the following shall be indexed 20 if known: a parcel identification number; a legal description 21 and parsed location information including platted and 22 unplatted information; and any additional parcel identifiers 23 used by a county auditor. The indexing and recording 24 requirements outlined in the bill take effect January 1, 2026. 25 Additionally, a recorder must note in the index the exact hour, 26 minute, and second a document or instrument is recorded. 27 The bill provides for the recording of surveys in new Code 28 section 331.612. Specific text sizing and formatting along 29 with page sizing, index legend requirements, and other required 30 information for surveys, plats, subdivision plats, and monument 31 preservation certificates, with an emphasis on legibility, 32 are provided. The recorder must accept a plat or subdivision 33 plat that meets the requirements outlined in Code section 34 355.7, 355.7A, or 355.8 submitted electronically through the 35 -19- LSB 1517XS (3) 91 ll/js 19/ 20 S.F. 371 electronic services system. The bill also provides for the use 1 of cover pages when submitting the information required in Code 2 section 331.606B(2) and outlines the location on the first page 3 where the information must be provided when filing a document 4 with the county recorder along with providing guidelines for 5 including designated space for a county recorderâs use. 6 -20- LSB 1517XS (3) 91 ll/js 20/ 20

EFFECTIVE DATE. The following takes effect January 9 1, 2026: 10 The portion of the section of this Act amending section 11 331.606, subsection 1. 12 EXPLANATION 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 14 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 15 This bill relates to certain required document criteria to 16 file documents and instruments with county recorders, fees 17 paid for recording documents, funds created for recorders and 18 the electronic services system and associated authorization 19 for spending moneys in those funds for certain purposes, the 20 creation of the electronic services system, organized by 21 an agreement pursuant to Code chapter 28E (28E agreement), 22 and the electronic filing system used to accept, manage, 23 and make available county recorder filings electronically. 24 Under current law, county recorders are required to execute 25 a 28E agreement with other counties to implement a county 26 land record information system in accordance with 2005 Iowa 27 Acts, chapter 179, section 101, subsection 1, as amended by 28 2021 Iowa Acts, chapter 126, section 2. The bill amends this 29 provision to require county recorders to enter into a 28E 30 agreement to create and implement the electronic services 31 system, a statewide electronic county land record information 32 system. The bill defines âelectronic services systemâ as the 33 organization formed under the 28E agreement. The electronic 34 services system is also the name of the actual electronic 35 -16- LSB 1517XS (3) 91 ll/js 16/ 20 S.F. 371 system implemented to accept, manage, and make available 1 records filed with a county recorder. 2 Several sections of Code chapter 331, subchapter V, 3 part 3, pertaining to the county recorder are amended to 4 specify certain requirements for documents or instruments 5 submitted to a county recorder for filing either in person 6 or electronically. Many of these requirements pertain to 7 required recording references, indexing, formatting, text, 8 margin sizes, and document size limitations with an emphasis on 9 legibility. References to the county land record information 10 system are removed throughout Code chapter 331 and replaced 11 with âelectronic services systemâ. 12 Under current law, in addition to the $5 county recorders 13 collect for each page of a document or instrument filed in 14 the county recorderâs office, $1 is collected for the county 15 recorderâs records management fund, and $1 is collected for 16 the county recorderâs electronic transaction fund. The bill 17 changes the fees to a flat fee of $10 for each page filed or 18 recorded in the recorderâs office, with a maximum recording fee 19 of $500 for 50 or more pages filed. From the total fee of $10 20 per page of a document or instrument filed with a recorder, $2 21 is transferred to the recorderâs technology advancement fund 22 and $3 is transferred to the recorderâs electronic services 23 system fund. 24 The bill eliminates the county recorderâs records management 25 funds and creates recorderâs technology advancement funds to 26 be used for the following purposes: maintaining and improving 27 equipment, software, and systems; preserving and maintaining 28 archived physical and electronic documents or instruments; 29 converting physical documents to electronic documents; and 30 education and training for advancing technology.

By the first 33 day of each month, the treasurer shall transfer the moneys 34 deposited into the recorderâs electronic services system fund 35 -17- LSB 1517XS (3) 91 ll/js 17/ 20 S.F. 371 to an account in a financial institution designated by the 1 governing board of the electronic services system to be used 2 as outlined in new Code section 331.605B for the following 3 purposes: to enable electronic filing for recording documents; 4 to provide electronic access to recorded public documents; to 5 receive electronic payments to process electronic documents 6 for recording; to implement security and redaction systems to 7 protect personally identifiable information; to integrate with 8 other appropriate real property filing or management systems; 9 to establish standards for processing, recording, indexing, 10 accessing, and archiving documents for electronic county land 11 record management systems; and to develop a notification system 12 for users when electronic filings or records are associated 13 with the userâs name, property, or other recorded filing 14 information. The recorder or the electronic services system 15 shall make available any information required by the county 16 auditor or auditor of state concerning the moneys collected 17 from fees and the uses for which such fees are expended. 18 The county treasurer must transfer moneys remaining in the 19 county recorderâs records management fund to the recorderâs 20 technology advancement fund and moneys remaining in the county 21 recorderâs electronic transaction fund to the recorderâs 22 electronic services fund on the effective date of the bill. 23 The bill provides that any moneys remaining in the local 24 government electronic transaction fund after the effective date 25 of the bill are appropriated to the treasurer of state to be 26 used by the treasurer of state to assist the governing board of 27 the electronic services system in accomplishing the purposes 28 stated in Code section 331.605B(1). 29 The electronic services system may collect a fee of not more 30 than $3 per recorded document, along with any service charges 31 associated with a credit or debit card payment, to receive and 32 process a document or instrument. Moneys collected from these 33 fees by the electronic services system must be used for the 34 same purposes as the recorderâs electronic services fund. The 35 -18- LSB 1517XS (3) 91 ll/js 18/ 20 S.F. 371 electronic services system cannot charge a fee for viewing, 1 accessing, or printing records and cannot provide access to 2 records on a batch basis. 3 The bill limits tort liability of government subdivisions 4 by excluding contractors hired by the governing board of the 5 electronic services systems from government employees. 6 The bill creates a process for a county recorder to decline 7 acceptance of a physical or electronic document and to provide 8 information to the filer to correct the defect. A recorderâs 9 ability to collect an additional recording fee of $10 per 10 document to accept nonconforming documents is eliminated. 11 The information required to be included by a recorder 12 who is filing and indexing documents or instruments into the 13 electronic county land record management system is outlined 14 and includes how reference numbers must be determined and 15 applied to filings each calendar year, the use of only numeric 16 references containing no more than six digits preceded by 17 a county two-digit code and four-digit year, and indexing 18 requirements for certain recorded documents associated with 19 the recording. Additionally, the following shall be indexed 20 if known: a parcel identification number; a legal description 21 and parsed location information including platted and 22 unplatted information; and any additional parcel identifiers 23 used by a county auditor. The indexing and recording 24 requirements outlined in the bill take effect January 1, 2026. 25 Additionally, a recorder must note in the index the exact hour, 26 minute, and second a document or instrument is recorded. 27 The bill provides for the recording of surveys in new Code 28 section 331.612.

The bill also provides for the use 1 of cover pages when submitting the information required in Code 2 section 331.606B(2) and outlines the location on the first page 3 where the information must be provided when filing a document 4 with the county recorder along with providing guidelines for 5 including designated space for a county recorderâs use. 6 -20- LSB 1517XS (3) 91 ll/js 20/ 20
