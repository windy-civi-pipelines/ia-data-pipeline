29 This bill relates to matters under the purview of the

34 that is readily accessible on the internet at no cost by
35 including the internet site in the rule adopting the standard

1 rather than posting the publication itself to the entity’s
2 internet site. The bill applies this generally to DIAL and
3 entities under DIAL’s purview.
4 The bill authorizes DIAL to administratively close
5 complaints that do not allege a violation of Code chapter 10A,
6 a board’s enabling statute, or a rule of a board. The bill also
7 specifies DIAL’s authority over fees established by rule by
8 boards under DIAL’s purview, provided that establishment of a
9 given fee by rule is otherwise authorized by law.
10 Under current law, DIAL is authorized to perform inspections
11 and investigations of health-related professions (Code section
12 147.88). The bill amends the responsibilities of DIAL’s
13 director to reflect that authorization.
14 The bill also requires DIAL’s director to coordinate
15 investigations relating to compliance with state or federal law
16 if an executive branch entity has entered into an agreement
17 with DIAL to conduct an investigation. The bill grants DIAL’s
18 investigators the powers and authority of a peace officer when
19 conducting such investigations.
20 The bill requires DIAL to keep private information that
21 DIAL receives for purposes of licensure confidential unless
22 authorized to release the information by a court, the lawful
23 custodian, or a person authorized to release the information.
24 The bill eliminates the fee for fire and accident
25 inspections conducted by DIAL and requires DIAL, rather than
26 the department of public safety, to adopt administrative rules
27 governing how parking spaces for persons with disabilities are
28 provided.
