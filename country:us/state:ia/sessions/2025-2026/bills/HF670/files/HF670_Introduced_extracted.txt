Current law 14 defines âchildâ as a person under 18 years of age. 15 The bill defines âjuvenile pre-charge diversion programâ 16 as a program certified by the department of health and human 17 services (HHS) to coordinate services for a child who is 18 alleged to have committed an offense that, if committed by an 19 adult, would constitute a simple misdemeanor for the purpose of 20 diverting the child from juvenile court proceedings. 21 The bill provides that the juvenile court shall retain 22 jurisdiction in proceedings concerning a child if the alleged 23 offense would constitute a misdemeanor if committed by an 24 adult, if the childâs case was transferred to the jurisdiction 25 of the juvenile court from a district court because the child 26 allegedly committed the offense prior to reaching 18 years of 27 age, or if the proceeding concerns an offense of animal torture 28 alleged to have been committed by a child under 17 years of 29 age. Juvenile court jurisdiction of a child who allegedly 30 commits an offense that, if committed by an adult, would 31 constitute a felony may be waived upon a juvenile court making 32 certain findings under Code section 232.45. 33 JUVENILE PRE-CHARGE DIVERSION PROGRAMS. The bill provides 34 that HHS shall certify juvenile pre-charge diversion programs 35 -5- LSB 1239YH (3) 91 dg/ko 5/ 7 H.F. 670 that offer rehabilitative services to a child who could be 1 subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court for the 2 purpose of diverting the child from a formal adjudication in 3 juvenile court. To be eligible for participation, the child 4 must have allegedly committed an offense that, if committed by 5 an adult, would constitute a simple misdemeanor and must not 6 have been referred to a juvenile pre-charge diversion program 7 within the 12 months prior to the date of the alleged offense. 8 The bill requires HHS to determine by rule minimum standards 9 for juvenile pre-charge diversion programs. Minimum standards 10 must require that a juvenile pre-charge diversion program 11 be a short-term, community-based program that focuses on 12 skill building and restorative justice principles.
