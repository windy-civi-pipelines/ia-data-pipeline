S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
2 the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
3 This bill relates to duties of the department of natural
4 resources (DNR) related to air quality.
5 Under current law, DNR is required to submit a report to the
6 governor and general assembly yearly by December 31 regarding
7 greenhouse gas emissions in the state during the previous
8 calendar year. Pursuant to the Consolidated Appropriations
9 Act of 2008, the United States environmental protection agency
10 (EPA) has started conducting annual statewide greenhouse gas
11 inventories. These inventories cover the year prior to the
12 previous year. The bill changes the time frame covered by the
13 report emissions that occurred two calendar years prior to the
14 current calendar year to align with EPA’s schedule and allows
15 the EPA inventory, if completed, to fulfill the reporting
16 requirement.
17 As a result of administrative code realignment, rules
18 relating to emission fees and operating permits previously in
19 567 IAC ch. 22 were moved to 567 IAC ch. 24. The bill removes
20 specified rule references to conform to the Iowa administrative
21 code change.
22 The bill removes a provision requiring the environmental
23 protection commission to adopt rules for the certification of
24 solid waste incinerator operators.
25 Under current law, DNR is required to create a greenhouse
26 gas inventory by gathering data and reporting information from
27 producers of greenhouse gases regarding their emissions and
28 coordinate this data collection with EPA. Additionally, DNR is
29 required to establish a voluntary greenhouse gas registry. The
30 bill repeals these requirements. Federal regulations provide
31 requirements for greenhouse gas reporting and a voluntary
32 greenhouse gas registry.
