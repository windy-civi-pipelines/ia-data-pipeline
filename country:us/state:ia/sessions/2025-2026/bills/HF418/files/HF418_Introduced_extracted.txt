The 9 director shall utilize information reported on abstracts of 10 assessment submitted pursuant to section 441.45 in determining 11 such percentage. For valuations established as of January 12 1, 2026, and each assessment year thereafter, the percentage 13 of actual value as equalized by the department of revenue as 14 provided in section 441.49 at which agricultural property shall 15 be assessed shall be calculated in accordance with the methods 16 provided in this paragraph. 17 (2) For valuations established for assessment years 18 beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the calculation of the 19 divisor for residential property under this subsection shall 20 exclude the value of all property described in subsection 14 , 21 paragraph âaâ , subparagraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6), 22 and the property described in subsection 14 , paragraph âaâ , 23 subparagraph (7), that contains three or more separate dwelling 24 units. 25 c.

NEW SECTION . 444.25 Maximum property tax levy rates 1 ââ adjustments. 2 1. For purposes of this section: 3 a. âBase year total taxable valueâ is the statewide total 4 assessed value for all property tax classifications used to 5 calculate taxes for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025. 6 b. âBudget year total taxable valueâ is the statewide 7 total assessed value for all property classifications used to 8 calculate taxes due and payable in the fiscal year beginning 9 during the calendar year in which a budget is certified, 10 excluding value attributable to new construction. 11 c. âRate-limited property tax levyâ includes any ad valorem 12 property tax levy limited by law to a specific maximum property 13 tax levy rate per one thousand dollars of assessed value used 14 to calculate taxes. 15 2. For each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2026, 16 each rate-limited property tax levy shall, by operation of 17 this section, be limited to a levy rate that is equal to a 18 percentage of the maximum specified levy rate or the actual 19 maximum levy approved at election, whichever is less and if 20 applicable, as follows: 21 a. For the property taxes due and payable in the fiscal 22 year beginning July 1, 2026, and each fiscal year thereafter 23 beginning before July 1, 2036, a percentage equal to the 24 quotient, expressed as a percentage, of the base year total 25 taxable value divided by the budget year total taxable value. 26 b. For the property taxes due and payable in fiscal years 27 beginning on or after July 1, 2036, a percentage equal to the 28 percentage applicable for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 29 2035. 30 EXPLANATION 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 32 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 33 This bill relates to property taxation by modifying the 34 methodology for determining actual value of residential 35 -9- LSB 2284YH (6) 91 jm/md 9/ 12 H.F. 418 property, assessment limitations of certain classes of 1 property, and certain levy rate limitations. 2 DIVISION I ââ RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY ACTUAL VALUE LIMITATION. 3 Under Code section 441.21, all property subject to taxation 4 shall be valued at its actual value and, except as otherwise 5 provided by law, shall be assessed at 100 percent of its actual 6 value, and the value so assessed shall be taken and considered 7 as the assessed value and taxable value of the property upon 8 which the levy shall be made. Actual value is generally 9 required to be the fair and reasonable market value. âMarket 10 valueâ is defined as the fair and reasonable exchange in the 11 year in which the property is listed and valued between a 12 willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any 13 compulsion to buy or sell and each being familiar with all 14 the facts relating to the particular property, but excluding 15 certain abnormal sales. 16 The bill provides that for assessment years beginning 17 on or after January 1, 2026, the actual value of each 18 individual property, including after adjustments to actual 19 values made as the result of equalization, shall not exceed 20 100 percent of the actual value of the property for the 21 immediately preceding assessment year unless the property was 22 not assessed in the immediately preceding assessment year, 23 the propertyâs boundaries change, there is a change to the 24 propertyâs classification, or new construction, additions, 25 or improvements have been made to the property other than 26 normal and necessary maintenance or repairs, not amounting to 27 structural replacements or modification. 28 The bill also makes conforming changes to other provisions 29 of law relating to the valuation of property. 30 DIVISION II ââ MODIFICATION OF ASSESSMENT LIMITATIONS. 31 Code section 441.21(4) establishes the calculation for 32 assessment limitations (rollback) for residential property and 33 agricultural property. The bill strikes the calculation of 34 the residential property assessment limitation for assessment 35 -10- LSB 2284YH (6) 91 jm/md 10/ 12 H.F. 418 years beginning on or after January 1, 2025, and strikes 1 the provision within the agricultural property assessment 2 limitation calculation that limits growth of residential or 3 agricultural property to the growth in the other classification 4 (ag-residential tie). The bill establishes a schedule of 5 assessment limitations for residential property that increases 6 each assessment year from the assessment year beginning January 7 1, 2025, until the assessment limitation reaches one hundred 8 percent for assessment years beginning on or after January 9 1, 2034. By operation of the scheduled increases to the 10 residential property assessment limitation, the assessment 11 limitation applicable to that portion of commercial, and 12 industrial property that is equal to or less than $150,000 is 13 also increased. 14 This division of the bill applies retroactively to 15 assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. 16 DIVISION III ââ PROPERTY TAX LEVY RATES. The bill 17 establishes a reduction for rate-limited property tax levies 18 that corresponds with the increase of assessment limitations 19 under the bill. The bill defines ârate-limited property tax 20 levyâ to be any ad valorem property tax levy limited by law to 21 a specific property tax levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value 22 used to calculate taxes. 23 For each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2026, 24 each rate-limited property tax levy shall, by operation of the 25 bill, be limited to a levy rate that is equal to a percentage 26 of the maximum specified levy rate or the actual maximum levy 27 approved at election, whichever is less and if applicable, 28 as follows: (1) for the property taxes due and payable in 29 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2026, and each fiscal year 30 thereafter beginning before July 1, 2036, a percentage equal 31 to the quotient, expressed as a percentage, of the base year 32 total taxable value divided by the budget year total taxable 33 value; and (2) for the property taxes due and payable in fiscal 34 years beginning on or after July 1, 2036, a percentage equal to 35 -11- LSB 2284YH (6) 91 jm/md 11/ 12 H.F. 418 the percentage applicable for the fiscal year beginning July 1 1, 2035. 2 The bill defines âbase year total taxable valueâ as 3 the statewide total assessed value for all property tax 4 classifications used to calculate taxes for the fiscal 5 year beginning July 1, 2025, and âbudget year total taxable 6 valueâ as the statewide total assessed value for all property 7 classifications used to calculate taxes due and payable in 8 the fiscal year beginning during the calendar year in which 9 a budget is certified, excluding value attributable to new 10 construction. 11 -12- LSB 2284YH (6) 91 jm/md 12/ 12

Section 441.21, subsection 4, Code 2025, is amended 20 to read as follows: 21 4. For valuations established as of January 1, 1979 2025 , 22 the percentage of actual value at which agricultural and 23 residential property shall be assessed shall be the quotient of 24 the dividend and divisor as defined in this section determined 25 under this subsection . 26 a.

The 29 dividend for each class of property shall be the dividend 30 as determined for each class of agricultural property for 31 valuations established as of January 1, 1978 2024 , adjusted by 32 the product obtained by multiplying the percentage determined 33 for that year by the amount of any additions or deletions to 34 actual value, excluding those resulting from the revaluation 35 -4- LSB 2284YH (6) 91 jm/md 4/ 12 H.F. 418 of existing properties, as reported by the assessors on the 1 abstracts of assessment for 1978 2024 , plus six three percent 2 of the amount so determined. 3 (2) However, if the difference between the dividend so 4 determined for either class of property and the dividend for 5 that class of property for valuations established as of January 6 1, 1978, adjusted by the product obtained by multiplying 7 the percentage determined for that year by the amount of 8 any additions or deletions to actual value, excluding those 9 resulting from the revaluation of existing properties, as 10 reported by the assessors on the abstracts of assessment for 11 1978, is less than six percent, the 1979 dividend for the other 12 class of property shall be the dividend as determined for that 13 class of property for valuations established as of January 14 1, 1978, adjusted by the product obtained by multiplying 15 the percentage determined for that year by the amount of 16 any additions or deletions to actual value, excluding those 17 resulting from the revaluation of existing properties, as 18 reported by the assessors on the abstracts of assessment for 19 1978, plus a percentage of the amount so determined which is 20 equal to the percentage by which the dividend as determined 21 for the other class of property for valuations established 22 as of January 1, 1978, adjusted by the product obtained by 23 multiplying the percentage determined for that year by the 24 amount of any additions or deletions to actual value, excluding 25 those resulting from the revaluation of existing properties, as 26 reported by the assessors on the abstracts of assessment for 27 1978, is increased in arriving at the 1979 dividend for the 28 other class of property. 29 (3) For valuations established for assessment years 30 beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the calculation of the 31 dividend for residential property under this subsection shall 32 exclude the value of all property described in subsection 14 , 33 paragraph âaâ , subparagraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6), 34 and the property described in subsection 14 , paragraph âaâ , 35 -5- LSB 2284YH (6) 91 jm/md 5/ 12 H.F. 418 subparagraph (7), that contains three or more separate dwelling 1 units. 2 b. (1) The divisor for each class of property shall be 3 the total actual value of all such agricultural property in 4 the state in the preceding year, as reported by the assessors 5 on the abstracts of assessment submitted for 1978 2024 , plus 6 the amount of value added to said total actual value by the 7 revaluation of existing properties in 1979 2025 as equalized 8 by the director of revenue pursuant to section 441.49 . The 9 director shall utilize information reported on abstracts of 10 assessment submitted pursuant to section 441.45 in determining 11 such percentage. For valuations established as of January 12 1, 2026, and each assessment year thereafter, the percentage 13 of actual value as equalized by the department of revenue as 14 provided in section 441.49 at which agricultural property shall 15 be assessed shall be calculated in accordance with the methods 16 provided in this paragraph. 17 (2) For valuations established for assessment years 18 beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the calculation of the 19 divisor for residential property under this subsection shall 20 exclude the value of all property described in subsection 14 , 21 paragraph âaâ , subparagraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6), 22 and the property described in subsection 14 , paragraph âaâ , 23 subparagraph (7), that contains three or more separate dwelling 24 units. 25 c.

NEW SECTION . 444.25 Maximum property tax levy rates 1 ââ adjustments. 2 1. For purposes of this section: 3 a. âBase year total taxable valueâ is the statewide total 4 assessed value for all property tax classifications used to 5 calculate taxes for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025. 6 b. âBudget year total taxable valueâ is the statewide 7 total assessed value for all property classifications used to 8 calculate taxes due and payable in the fiscal year beginning 9 during the calendar year in which a budget is certified, 10 excluding value attributable to new construction. 11 c. âRate-limited property tax levyâ includes any ad valorem 12 property tax levy limited by law to a specific maximum property 13 tax levy rate per one thousand dollars of assessed value used 14 to calculate taxes. 15 2. For each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2026, 16 each rate-limited property tax levy shall, by operation of 17 this section, be limited to a levy rate that is equal to a 18 percentage of the maximum specified levy rate or the actual 19 maximum levy approved at election, whichever is less and if 20 applicable, as follows: 21 a. For the property taxes due and payable in the fiscal 22 year beginning July 1, 2026, and each fiscal year thereafter 23 beginning before July 1, 2036, a percentage equal to the 24 quotient, expressed as a percentage, of the base year total 25 taxable value divided by the budget year total taxable value. 26 b. For the property taxes due and payable in fiscal years 27 beginning on or after July 1, 2036, a percentage equal to the 28 percentage applicable for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 29 2035. 30 EXPLANATION 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 32 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 33 This bill relates to property taxation by modifying the 34 methodology for determining actual value of residential 35 -9- LSB 2284YH (6) 91 jm/md 9/ 12 H.F. 418 property, assessment limitations of certain classes of 1 property, and certain levy rate limitations. 2 DIVISION I ââ RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY ACTUAL VALUE LIMITATION. 3 Under Code section 441.21, all property subject to taxation 4 shall be valued at its actual value and, except as otherwise 5 provided by law, shall be assessed at 100 percent of its actual 6 value, and the value so assessed shall be taken and considered 7 as the assessed value and taxable value of the property upon 8 which the levy shall be made. Actual value is generally 9 required to be the fair and reasonable market value. âMarket 10 valueâ is defined as the fair and reasonable exchange in the 11 year in which the property is listed and valued between a 12 willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any 13 compulsion to buy or sell and each being familiar with all 14 the facts relating to the particular property, but excluding 15 certain abnormal sales. 16 The bill provides that for assessment years beginning 17 on or after January 1, 2026, the actual value of each 18 individual property, including after adjustments to actual 19 values made as the result of equalization, shall not exceed 20 100 percent of the actual value of the property for the 21 immediately preceding assessment year unless the property was 22 not assessed in the immediately preceding assessment year, 23 the propertyâs boundaries change, there is a change to the 24 propertyâs classification, or new construction, additions, 25 or improvements have been made to the property other than 26 normal and necessary maintenance or repairs, not amounting to 27 structural replacements or modification. 28 The bill also makes conforming changes to other provisions 29 of law relating to the valuation of property. 30 DIVISION II ââ MODIFICATION OF ASSESSMENT LIMITATIONS. 31 Code section 441.21(4) establishes the calculation for 32 assessment limitations (rollback) for residential property and 33 agricultural property. The bill strikes the calculation of 34 the residential property assessment limitation for assessment 35 -10- LSB 2284YH (6) 91 jm/md 10/ 12 H.F. 418 years beginning on or after January 1, 2025, and strikes 1 the provision within the agricultural property assessment 2 limitation calculation that limits growth of residential or 3 agricultural property to the growth in the other classification 4 (ag-residential tie). The bill establishes a schedule of 5 assessment limitations for residential property that increases 6 each assessment year from the assessment year beginning January 7 1, 2025, until the assessment limitation reaches one hundred 8 percent for assessment years beginning on or after January 9 1, 2034. By operation of the scheduled increases to the 10 residential property assessment limitation, the assessment 11 limitation applicable to that portion of commercial, and 12 industrial property that is equal to or less than $150,000 is 13 also increased. 14 This division of the bill applies retroactively to 15 assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. 16 DIVISION III ââ PROPERTY TAX LEVY RATES. The bill 17 establishes a reduction for rate-limited property tax levies 18 that corresponds with the increase of assessment limitations 19 under the bill. The bill defines ârate-limited property tax 20 levyâ to be any ad valorem property tax levy limited by law to 21 a specific property tax levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value 22 used to calculate taxes. 23 For each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2026, 24 each rate-limited property tax levy shall, by operation of the 25 bill, be limited to a levy rate that is equal to a percentage 26 of the maximum specified levy rate or the actual maximum levy 27 approved at election, whichever is less and if applicable, 28 as follows: (1) for the property taxes due and payable in 29 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2026, and each fiscal year 30 thereafter beginning before July 1, 2036, a percentage equal 31 to the quotient, expressed as a percentage, of the base year 32 total taxable value divided by the budget year total taxable 33 value; and (2) for the property taxes due and payable in fiscal 34 years beginning on or after July 1, 2036, a percentage equal to 35 -11- LSB 2284YH (6) 91 jm/md 11/ 12 H.F. 418 the percentage applicable for the fiscal year beginning July 1 1, 2035. 2 The bill defines âbase year total taxable valueâ as 3 the statewide total assessed value for all property tax 4 classifications used to calculate taxes for the fiscal 5 year beginning July 1, 2025, and âbudget year total taxable 6 valueâ as the statewide total assessed value for all property 7 classifications used to calculate taxes due and payable in 8 the fiscal year beginning during the calendar year in which 9 a budget is certified, excluding value attributable to new 10 construction. 11 -12- LSB 2284YH (6) 91 jm/md 12/ 12
