(1) A course of instruction for school bus drivers approved
by the department of education.
(2) Entry-level driver training completed in accordance
with section 321.188, subsection 1, paragraph C -, if such

(a) The department of education, in collaboration with
the department of transportation, shall adopt rules pursuant
