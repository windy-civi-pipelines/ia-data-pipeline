1 Section 1. Section 452A.53, subsection 5, Code 2025, is
2 amended to read as follows:
3 5. Each vehicle operated into or through Iowa in interstate
4 operations using motor fuel, special fuel, or electric fuel
5 acquired in any other state shall carry in or on the vehicle a
6 duplicate or evidence of the permit or license required in this
7 section. A fee not to exceed fifty cents shall be charged The
8 state department of transportation shall adopt rules pursuant
9 to chapter 17A to set the fee for each duplicate or other
10 evidence of a permit or license issued.
11 EXPLANATION
12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
13 the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
14 Under current law, Code section 452A.52 prohibits a motor
15 vehicle, other than a private passenger automobile, from
16 bringing into Iowa any motor fuel or special fuel (including
17 electric fuel stored in batteries) to be used in the operation
18 of the vehicle in Iowa unless that person has paid, or made
19 arrangements in advance with the department of transportation
20 (DOT) for payment of, Iowa fuel taxes on the gallonage consumed
21 while operating the vehicle in Iowa.
22 Additionally, each vehicle operated into or through Iowa
23 in interstate operations using motor fuel, special fuel, or
24 electric fuel acquired in any other state must carry in or on
25 the vehicle a duplicate or evidence of the associated permit
26 or license. The fee for a duplicate or other evidence of such
27 a permit or license is 50 cents. This bill strikes the fee
28 amount and instead requires the DOT to adopt administrative
29 rules to set the fee.
30 Persons choosing not to make advance arrangements with
31 the DOT by procuring a permit or license are not relieved of
32 their responsibility to purchase motor fuel, special fuel, and
33 electric fuel commensurate with their use of Iowa’s highway
34 system. A person who violates Code section 452A.52 commits a
35 simple misdemeanor punishable by a $260 scheduled fine.
