HHS may disclose the information 16 as necessary to complete an audit or examination, or to the 17 extent HHSâs auditor is required by law to report the same or 18 to testify in court. The bill also prevents the state auditor 19 from accessing the information except as required to comply 20 with the standards for engagement described in Code section 21 11.3 (when audits and examinations begin), to comply with state 22 or federal regulations, or in case of alleged or suspected 23 embezzlement or theft. 24 DIVISION V ââ REGION INCENTIVE FUND ââ DISTRIBUTIONS AND 25 TRANSFERS. The bill appropriates from the region incentive 26 fund of the mental health and disability services regional 27 service fund to HHS for FY 2024-2025, an amount as necessary to 28 ensure the continuity of care for persons transferring services 29 from the mental health and disability services system to the 30 behavioral health services system (BHSS) and for distribution 31 to ASOs to be used for expenses related to the duties of the ASO 32 under the BHSS. The moneys used by an ASO do not count toward 33 any limit on the ASOâs administrative costs. 34 The bill requires any unobligated and unencumbered moneys 35 -15- LSB 1459SV (2) 91 dg/ko 15/ 16 S.F. 582 remaining in the mental health and disability services regional 1 service fund on June 30, 2025, to be transferred to the 2 behavioral health fund. 3 This division of the bill is effective upon enactment and 4 applies retroactively to July 1, 2024. 5 DIVISION VI ââ HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION ââ APPLICABLE 6 PERCENTAGE FOR PREMIUM TAX. Under current law, a health 7 maintenance organization contracting with HHS to administer the 8 medical assistance program must pay taxes to the director of 9 the department of revenue for deposit in the Medicaid managed 10 care organization premiums fund, an amount equal to 2.5 percent 11 of the premiums received and taxable. The bill changes such 12 amount to the applicable percent of the premiums received and 13 taxable. The âapplicable percentâ is defined in Code section 14 432.1(2) (tax on gross premiums ââ exclusions), and is .95 15 percent for the 2025 calendar year, .925 percent for the 2026 16 calendar year, and .9 percent for the 2027 calendar year and 17 all subsequent calendar years. 18 This division of the bill is effective upon enactment and 19 applies retroactively to January 1, 2024. 20 -16- LSB 1459SV (2) 91 dg/ko 16/ 16

This division of this 10 Act applies retroactively to January 1, 2024. 11 EXPLANATION 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 13 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 14 This bill relates to matters under the purview of the 15 department of health and human services (HHS). 16 DIVISION I ââ ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS. The 17 bill excludes persons employed by an administrative services 18 organization (ASO) from the definition of an employee for the 19 purposes of the Iowa public employeesâ retirement system. 20 The bill prohibits an ASO, or an officer or an employee 21 of an ASO, from acting as a countyâs advocate to represent 22 the interests of patients involuntarily hospitalized by the 23 court in matters relating to a patientâs hospitalization or 24 treatment. 25 DIVISION II ââ CHILD FOSTER CARE. Under current law, a 26 personâs periodic support payments pursuant to an order or 27 judgment are deemed assigned to HHS if the person is or has 28 a child receiving foster care services. The assignment does 29 not apply when a child is placed with a relative or fictive 30 kin of the child who is not licensed to provide child foster 31 care. The bill permits the assignment unless the relative or 32 fictive kin is not licensed to provide child foster care and 33 not approved by HHS to provide services as specified by HHS. 34 The bill defines âfictive kinâ as an adult person who is 35 -13- LSB 1459SV (2) 91 dg/ko 13/ 16 S.F. 582 not a relative of a child but who has an emotionally positive 1 significant relationship with the child or the childâs family. 2 The bill defines âfoster family homeâ as a licensed 3 single-family home environment in which an individual provides 4 child foster care. 5 The bill includes within the Code chapter 237 (child foster 6 care facilities) definition of âlicenseeâ, an individual who 7 has been approved by HHS to provide child foster care. 8 The bill makes several changes to Code chapter 237 and to 9 Code sections 232.78 (temporary custody of a child pursuant to 10 ex parte court order), 232.98 (hearing concerning temporary 11 removal), 232.102 (transfer of legal custody of child and 12 placement), 234.1 (child and family services ââ definitions), 13 234.39 (child and family services ââ responsibility for costs 14 of services), 237A.3A (child development homes), and 423.3 15 (streamlined sales and use tax Act ââ exemptions). 16 DIVISION III ââ CHILD AND DEPENDENT ADULT ABUSE. The bill 17 allows a community-based entity to apply for and receive 18 funds appropriated to HHS by the general assembly for child 19 abuse prevention.

HHS may disclose the information 16 as necessary to complete an audit or examination, or to the 17 extent HHSâs auditor is required by law to report the same or 18 to testify in court. The bill also prevents the state auditor 19 from accessing the information except as required to comply 20 with the standards for engagement described in Code section 21 11.3 (when audits and examinations begin), to comply with state 22 or federal regulations, or in case of alleged or suspected 23 embezzlement or theft. 24 DIVISION V ââ REGION INCENTIVE FUND ââ DISTRIBUTIONS AND 25 TRANSFERS.

The moneys used by an ASO do not count toward 33 any limit on the ASOâs administrative costs. 34 The bill requires any unobligated and unencumbered moneys 35 -15- LSB 1459SV (2) 91 dg/ko 15/ 16 S.F. 582 remaining in the mental health and disability services regional 1 service fund on June 30, 2025, to be transferred to the 2 behavioral health fund. 3 This division of the bill is effective upon enactment and 4 applies retroactively to July 1, 2024. 5 DIVISION VI ââ HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION ââ APPLICABLE 6 PERCENTAGE FOR PREMIUM TAX.
