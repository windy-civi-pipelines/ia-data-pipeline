This section is repealed December 31, 2028. 6 DIVISION VII 7 COUNTY HOSPITAL BOARD OF TRUSTEES 8 Sec. 43. Section 347.9, subsection 3, Code 2025, is amended 9 by striking the subsection. 10 Sec. 44. TRANSITION. This division of this Act does not 11 alter the term of office of a trustee elected to a county 12 public hospital board of trustees prior to the effective date 13 of this division of this Act. 14 Sec. 45. EFFECTIVE DATE. This division of this Act takes 15 effect January 1, 2026. 16 EXPLANATION 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 18 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 19 This bill relates to duties of the secretary of state, 20 including the address confidentiality program and the conduct 21 of elections. The bill is organized in divisions. 22 DIVISION I ââ ADDRESS CONFIDENTIALITY PROGRAM. This 23 division relates to the address confidentiality program, which 24 provides mail forwarding services to persons who are victims of 25 domestic abuse, domestic abuse assault, sexual abuse, assault, 26 stalking, or human trafficking, or who fear for their own 27 safety or the safety of a household member. The bill allows 28 the secretary of state to accept as a program participantâs 29 mailing address the name and other contact information of 30 a shelter in lieu of the shelterâs physical address, to 31 cancel a deceased participantâs certification, and to hold a 32 participantâs mail for up to 30 days at the request of the 33 participant. 34 This division takes effect upon enactment. 35 -16- LSB 1755YH (2) 91 ss/ns 16/ 20 H.F. 91 DIVISION II ââ CANDIDATE ELIGIBILITY OBJECTIONS. This 1 division relates to the nomination of candidates for federal 2 office. The bill exempts candidates for federal office from 3 the requirement that a candidate sign a statement that the 4 candidate is aware that the candidate is disqualified from 5 holding office if the candidate has been convicted of a felony 6 or other infamous crime and the candidateâs rights have not 7 been restored by the governor or by the president of the United 8 States. The bill limits objections to the eligibility of a 9 candidate for a federal office that may be filed with the 10 state commissioner of elections to objections to the legal 11 sufficiency of the nomination petition or certificate of 12 election, or to the residency, age, or citizenship requirements 13 as described in the United States Constitution. With 14 respect to nominations for president or vice president of the 15 United States, the bill allows objections only to the legal 16 sufficiency of the certificate of nomination. The certificate 17 of nomination shall be presumed valid. 18 This division takes effect upon enactment. 19 DIVISION III ââ RANKED CHOICE VOTING. This division relates 20 to the use of ranked choice and instant runoff voting for 21 elections in this state. The bill prohibits ranked choice and 22 instant runoff voting, defined in the bill as a system in which 23 voters rank multiple candidates for a single office in order of 24 preference and candidates are eliminated and votes transferred 25 between candidates in a series of rounds, from being used to 26 cast or tabulate ballots in any election in this state. 27 This division takes effect January 1, 2026. 28 DIVISION IV ââ ABSENT VOTERS. This division relates to 29 the casting of ballots by absent voters. The bill strikes 30 provisions allowing a county commissioner of elections to 31 establish drop boxes to which a person can return an absentee 32 ballot. 33 The bill requires an absentee ballot that is mailed to a 34 voter to be enclosed in an unsealed affidavit envelope and with 35 -17- LSB 1755YH (2) 91 ss/ns 17/ 20 H.F. 91 or in an unsealed return envelope, which shall then be enclosed 1 in the delivery envelope. If the ballot cannot be folded so 2 that all the votes on the ballot will be hidden, the bill 3 requires the commissioner to also send a secrecy envelope. The 4 bill requires a registered voter to subscribe to an affidavit 5 on an affidavit envelope by signing the envelope and writing 6 the voterâs voter verification number. The bill also requires 7 return envelopes to have printed on them the deadline to return 8 the ballot and the manner to track the status of the ballot. 9 The bill strikes a requirement that an affidavit envelope 10 be considered to contain a defect if it appears to the county 11 commissioner of elections that it was signed by a person other 12 than the voter. The bill adds a requirement that an affidavit 13 envelope be considered to contain a defect if the voter 14 verification number on the envelope does not match the voter 15 verification number on file for the voter. 16 The bill strikes certain requirements regarding what 17 materials a commissioner shall include with an absentee ballot 18 and instead requires a commissioner to put the same serial 19 number on the affidavit, return, and delivery envelopes. 20 The bill requires all mailed absentee ballots to include an 21 affidavit envelope. The bill also requires the absentee and 22 special voters precinct board to reject an absentee ballot 23 if the affidavit envelope does not include the voterâs voter 24 verification number. 25 The bill changes the timeline for the mailing and return 26 of absentee ballots. The bill allows a county commissioner 27 of elections to mail absentee ballots to voters beginning 22 28 days before an election and requires absentee ballots to be 29 delivered to the office of the county commissioner of elections 30 by 5:00 p.m. on the day before election day. The bill also 31 requires the county commissioner of elections to record 32 the ballot as received by 11:59 p.m. on the day before the 33 election. Under current law, county commissioners of elections 34 may mail absentee ballots beginning 20 days before an election 35 -18- LSB 1755YH (2) 91 ss/ns 18/ 20 H.F. 91 and absentee ballots must be delivered to the office of the 1 county commissioner of elections not later than the time polls 2 close on election day. 3 This division takes effect January 1, 2026. 4 DIVISION V ââ PERSONS PERMITTED IN VOTING BOOTHS. This 5 division amends the subsection of Code section 49.88 6 (limitation on persons in booth and time for voting) 7 prohibiting a person standing for election on the ballot before 8 a voter from occupying the voting booth with the voter and 9 Code section 49.90 (assisting voter) to say that the candidate 10 violates Code section 49.88 by occupying the voting booth with 11 the voter. 12 This division takes effect January 1, 2026. 13 DIVISION VI ââ VOTER REGISTRATION DATABASE PILOT PROGRAM. 14 This division requires the state registrar of voters to 15 contract with a third-party vendor to develop or provide a 16 program to allow the state registrar to verify the status of 17 records in the statewide voter registration file and identify 18 ineligible voters on an ongoing basis. During the first 19 quarter of 2026, the bill requires the state registrar of 20 voters to utilize the program developed or provided by the 21 third-party vendor to verify the status of records in the 22 statewide voter registration file. The state registrar shall 23 forward the results of the analysis to each county commissioner 24 of registration prior to the date that county commissioners 25 of registration are required to submit voter list maintenance 26 reports. The bill requires the state registrar of voters to 27 evaluate the efficacy and cost of the pilot program as compared 28 to the current method of maintaining the statewide voter 29 registration database. The pilot program is repealed effective 30 December 31, 2028. 31 DIVISION VII ââ COUNTY HOSPITAL BOARD OF TRUSTEES. This 32 division strikes a provision setting the term length for 33 persons elected to a county hospital board of trustees in a 34 county with a population of at least 400,000 to six years, 35 -19- LSB 1755YH (2) 91 ss/ns 19/ 20 H.F. 91 returning the term length to four years. The bill does not 1 affect the term of office of a trustee elected to a county 2 public hospital board of trustees prior to January 1, 2026. 3 This division takes effect January 1, 2026. 4 -20- LSB 1755YH (2) 91 ss/ns 20/ 20
