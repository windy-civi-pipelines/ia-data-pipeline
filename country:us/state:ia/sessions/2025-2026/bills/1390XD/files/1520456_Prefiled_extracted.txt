14 sum distribution. A nonresident is liable for this tax only
15 on that portion of the lump sum distribution allocable to
16 Iowa. The total amount of the lump sum distribution subject

7 1. The section of this Act amending section 2.48, subsection
8 3, paragraph “h”.
9 EXPLANATION
10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
11 the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
12 This bill relates to the administration of the tax by
13 the department of revenue by modifying provisions related
14 to personal income, property, sales and use, motor fuel,
15 inheritance tax, and changing tax expenditure reviews.
16 DIVISION I —— DISCLOSURE OF TAX INFORMATION. The bill
17 specifies and updates the circumstances the department of
18 revenue (department) may disclose state tax return and audit
19 information to law enforcement. The bill also makes conforming
20 changes related to disclosure of state tax return information
21 to the treasurer of state for purposes of determining ownership
22 of abandoned property.
23 The division takes effect upon enactment.
24 DIVISION II —— ANNUAL REPORTING. The bill strikes the
25 requirement that the department annually report to the general
26 assembly the areas of recurrent taxpayer noncompliance with the
27 rules of the department including any recommendations relating
28 to the noncompliance.
29 DIVISION III —— PROPERTY TAX —— EXTENSIONS. Under current
30 law, a claimant may ask the director of the department, the
31 county treasurer, or the director of the department of health
32 and human services for an extension to claim a reimbursement
33 for rent constituting property taxes in case of sickness,
34 absence, or disability. The bill strikes the director of the
35 department from involvement in the extension request by the
LSB 1390XD (7) 91
-22- jm/jh 22/26
S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 claimant.
2 Under current law, when issuing a refund for an erroneous
3 property tax paid by a taxpayer, the taxpayer must have
4 presented a claim of refund to the board of supervisors, or if
5 appealed, a claim to the property assessment appeal or district
6 court within two years of the final decision on the property
7 taxes owed. Under the bill, a taxpayer is eligible to claim
8 a refund for an erroneous tax if the taxpayer had previously
9 appealed the claim for a refund of an erroneous tax to the
10 director of revenue within two years of the director’s final
11 decision. This provision takes effect upon enactment.
12 DIVISION IV —— FARM TENANCY INCOME TAX EXCLUSION.
13 Currently, an eligible individual may exclude income received
14 by the individual pursuant to a farm tenancy covering real
15 property held by the individual for 10 or more years, if the
16 individual materially participated in a farming business for
17 10 or more years. The bill allows the eligible individual to
18 exclude such income under such circumstances, if the individual
19 materially participated in a farming business for 10 or more
20 years in the aggregate. The bill further specifies the term
21 “held” is to be determined by the holding period provisions of
22 section 1223 of the Internal Revenue Code and other federal
23 regulations which is identical to the use of the term “held”
24 under the farming business exclusion in Code section 422.7(13).
25 DIVISION V —— PASS-THROUGH ENTITIES. Under current law,
26 the department may issue a notice of adjustment (adjustment of
27 tax) to a partnership or pass-through entity pursuant to Code
28 section 422.25C, and specifies that the notice of adjustment
29 is appealable pursuant to Code sections 422.28 and 422.29.
30 The bill specifies the notice of adjustment is not always
31 appealable under the circumstances provided in Code section
32 422.25.
33 The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
34 retroactively to January 1, 2024.
35 DIVISION VI —— SALES TAX CHANGES. The bill makes changes to
LSB 1390XD (7) 91
-23- jm/jh 23/26
S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 the collection of sales taxes on building materials, supplies,
2 and equipment where an owner, contractor, subcontractor, or
3 builder is also a retailer holding a sales and use tax permit.
4 Under such circumstances, if a customer of the retailer
5 purchases tangible personal property from the retailer, the
6 bill provides that such property will not be subject to sales
7 tax if the property will be subject to sales tax at resale at a
8 later date or if the property will be subject to use tax at the
9 time the retailer withdraws the property from inventory for use
10 by the retailer in construction. The bill makes other related
11 changes to enhance the readability of the provision.
12 Under current law, a purchaser, user, and consumer of
13 taxable property or services may be authorized to remit tax
14 owed directly to the department instead of the tax being
15 collected and paid by the seller. The bill specifies that in
16 order to qualify for the direct pay tax permit such a taxpayer
17 must accrue a tax liability of more than $8,000 on a monthly
18 basis. Currently, such a taxpayer must accrue a tax liability
19 of $4,000 on a semimonthly basis in order to qualify for the
20 direct pay tax permit.
21 DIVISION VII —— MOTOR FUEL TAXES. Under current law and
22 before July 1, 2026, the department determines the rate of
23 excise tax imposed on each gallon of ethanol blended gasoline
24 based upon the distribution percentage calculated in Code
25 section 452A.3(1)(b), and the excise tax rate imposed on each
26 gallon of biodiesel blended fuel based on the distribution
27 percentage calculated in Code section 453A.3(3)(a)(2). The
28 department determines the distribution percentage based upon
29 data from reports filed pursuant to Code section 452A.33. The
30 bill allows the department to amend the initial distribution
31 percentage due to a mistake, or if there is a late report filed
32 by a retail dealer to the department, or the distribution
33 percentage is not accurate.
34 The bill changes the due date of a biannual tax return
35 relating to electric fuel tax due in January by one day, and
LSB 1390XD (7) 91
-24- jm/jh 24/26
S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 modifies the biannual tax period by one day.
2 The bill allows a person who uses electric fuel for a
3 nontaxable purpose to provide an exemption certificate to
4 the license holder selling or dispensing the fuel, if the
5 certificate is produced by the department.
6 DIVISION VIII —— INHERITANCE TAX —— FUTURE CODE CHANGES DUE
7 TO REPEAL. The bill changes numerous Code sections to reflect
8 the repeal of the inheritance tax beginning for the estates of
9 decedents dying on or after January 1, 2025. However, other
10 provisions of Code chapter 450 relating to the inheritance
11 tax have not been repealed. The division takes effect upon
12 enactment and applies retroactively to the estates of decedents
13 dying on or after January 1, 2025.
14 DIVISION IX —— LUMP SUM DISTRIBUTION OF RETIREMENT INCOME.
15 Under current law, commencing with tax years beginning on or
16 after January 1, 2023, retirement income is not subject to
17 Iowa individual income tax. However, under current law a lump
18 sum distribution from a retirement account is subject to Iowa
19 income tax under Code section 422.5(8) at a rate of 25 percent
20 of the federal tax rate imposed on the amount of the lump sum
21 distribution.
22 The bill provides that the taxation of a lump sum
23 distribution from a retirement account is also exempt from
24 state taxation by exempting the lump sum distribution for a
25 person who is disabled, or 55 years of age or older, or who is
26 the surviving spouse of an individual or is a survivor having
27 an insurable interest in an individual who would have qualified
28 for the exemption for the tax year.
29 The bill excludes the lump sum distribution exempt from
30 state taxation from being included in calculating the

1 DIVISION X —— ESTIMATED TAX THRESHOLD. Under the bill,
2 a taxpayer filing a return is required to make estimated
3 tax payments if Iowa income tax liability can reasonably be
4 expected to exceed $1,000 or more. Under current law, such
5 a taxpayer filing a return is required to make estimated
6 tax payments if Iowa income tax liability can reasonably be
7 expected to exceed $200 or more.
8 The division takes effect January 1, 2026, and applies to tax
9 years beginning on or after that date.
10 DIVISION XI —— TAX EXPENDITURE REVIEW. The bill specifies
11 that the department administering a tax expenditure (tax
12 credit) is not required to review the tax expenditure if the
13 tax expenditure has been repealed or if a zero amount of the
14 tax expenditure remains available to be awarded or claimed.
15 The bill removes four tax expenditures from tax expenditure
16 review: the Iowa fund of funds program in Code chapter 15E,
17 the wind energy production tax credits under Code chapter 476B,
18 the ethanol promotion tax credit in Code section 422.11N (Code
19 2006), and the minimum tax credit under Code section 422.11B
20 (Code 2018). The bill amends the Acts to align the review of
21 the renewable chemical production tax credit in Code section
22 2.48 with the future repeal of the renewable chemical tax
23 credit program.

8 3, paragraph “h”.
9 EXPLANATION
10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
11 the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
12 This bill relates to the administration of the tax by
13 the department of revenue by modifying provisions related
14 to personal income, property, sales and use, motor fuel,
15 inheritance tax, and changing tax expenditure reviews.
16 DIVISION I —— DISCLOSURE OF TAX INFORMATION. The bill
17 specifies and updates the circumstances the department of
18 revenue (department) may disclose state tax return and audit
19 information to law enforcement. The bill also makes conforming
20 changes related to disclosure of state tax return information
21 to the treasurer of state for purposes of determining ownership
22 of abandoned property.
23 The division takes effect upon enactment.
24 DIVISION II —— ANNUAL REPORTING. The bill strikes the
25 requirement that the department annually report to the general
26 assembly the areas of recurrent taxpayer noncompliance with the
27 rules of the department including any recommendations relating
28 to the noncompliance.
29 DIVISION III —— PROPERTY TAX —— EXTENSIONS. Under current
30 law, a claimant may ask the director of the department, the
31 county treasurer, or the director of the department of health
32 and human services for an extension to claim a reimbursement
33 for rent constituting property taxes in case of sickness,
34 absence, or disability. The bill strikes the director of the
35 department from involvement in the extension request by the

1 claimant.
2 Under current law, when issuing a refund for an erroneous
3 property tax paid by a taxpayer, the taxpayer must have
4 presented a claim of refund to the board of supervisors, or if
5 appealed, a claim to the property assessment appeal or district
6 court within two years of the final decision on the property
7 taxes owed. Under the bill, a taxpayer is eligible to claim
8 a refund for an erroneous tax if the taxpayer had previously
9 appealed the claim for a refund of an erroneous tax to the
10 director of revenue within two years of the director’s final
11 decision. This provision takes effect upon enactment.
12 DIVISION IV —— FARM TENANCY INCOME TAX EXCLUSION.
13 Currently, an eligible individual may exclude income received
14 by the individual pursuant to a farm tenancy covering real
15 property held by the individual for 10 or more years, if the
16 individual materially participated in a farming business for
17 10 or more years. The bill allows the eligible individual to
18 exclude such income under such circumstances, if the individual
19 materially participated in a farming business for 10 or more
20 years in the aggregate. The bill further specifies the term
21 “held” is to be determined by the holding period provisions of
22 section 1223 of the Internal Revenue Code and other federal
23 regulations which is identical to the use of the term “held”
24 under the farming business exclusion in Code section 422.7(13).
25 DIVISION V —— PASS-THROUGH ENTITIES. Under current law,
26 the department may issue a notice of adjustment (adjustment of
27 tax) to a partnership or pass-through entity pursuant to Code
28 section 422.25C, and specifies that the notice of adjustment
29 is appealable pursuant to Code sections 422.28 and 422.29.
30 The bill specifies the notice of adjustment is not always
31 appealable under the circumstances provided in Code section
32 422.25.
33 The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
34 retroactively to January 1, 2024.
35 DIVISION VI —— SALES TAX CHANGES. The bill makes changes to
LSB 1390XD (7) 91
-23- jm/jh 23/26

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 the collection of sales taxes on building materials, supplies,
2 and equipment where an owner, contractor, subcontractor, or
3 builder is also a retailer holding a sales and use tax permit.
4 Under such circumstances, if a customer of the retailer
5 purchases tangible personal property from the retailer, the
6 bill provides that such property will not be subject to sales
7 tax if the property will be subject to sales tax at resale at a
8 later date or if the property will be subject to use tax at the
9 time the retailer withdraws the property from inventory for use
10 by the retailer in construction. The bill makes other related
11 changes to enhance the readability of the provision.
12 Under current law, a purchaser, user, and consumer of
13 taxable property or services may be authorized to remit tax
14 owed directly to the department instead of the tax being
15 collected and paid by the seller. The bill specifies that in
16 order to qualify for the direct pay tax permit such a taxpayer
17 must accrue a tax liability of more than $8,000 on a monthly
18 basis. Currently, such a taxpayer must accrue a tax liability
19 of $4,000 on a semimonthly basis in order to qualify for the
20 direct pay tax permit.
21 DIVISION VII —— MOTOR FUEL TAXES. Under current law and
22 before July 1, 2026, the department determines the rate of
23 excise tax imposed on each gallon of ethanol blended gasoline
24 based upon the distribution percentage calculated in Code
25 section 452A.3(1)(b), and the excise tax rate imposed on each
26 gallon of biodiesel blended fuel based on the distribution
27 percentage calculated in Code section 453A.3(3)(a)(2). The
28 department determines the distribution percentage based upon
29 data from reports filed pursuant to Code section 452A.33. The
30 bill allows the department to amend the initial distribution
31 percentage due to a mistake, or if there is a late report filed
32 by a retail dealer to the department, or the distribution
33 percentage is not accurate.
34 The bill changes the due date of a biannual tax return
35 relating to electric fuel tax due in January by one day, and
LSB 1390XD (7) 91
-24- jm/jh 24/26

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 modifies the biannual tax period by one day.
2 The bill allows a person who uses electric fuel for a
3 nontaxable purpose to provide an exemption certificate to
4 the license holder selling or dispensing the fuel, if the
5 certificate is produced by the department.
6 DIVISION VIII —— INHERITANCE TAX —— FUTURE CODE CHANGES DUE
7 TO REPEAL. The bill changes numerous Code sections to reflect
8 the repeal of the inheritance tax beginning for the estates of
9 decedents dying on or after January 1, 2025. However, other
10 provisions of Code chapter 450 relating to the inheritance
11 tax have not been repealed. The division takes effect upon
12 enactment and applies retroactively to the estates of decedents
13 dying on or after January 1, 2025.
14 DIVISION IX —— LUMP SUM DISTRIBUTION OF RETIREMENT INCOME.
15 Under current law, commencing with tax years beginning on or
16 after January 1, 2023, retirement income is not subject to
17 Iowa individual income tax. However, under current law a lump
18 sum distribution from a retirement account is subject to Iowa
19 income tax under Code section 422.5(8) at a rate of 25 percent
20 of the federal tax rate imposed on the amount of the lump sum
21 distribution.
22 The bill provides that the taxation of a lump sum
23 distribution from a retirement account is also exempt from
24 state taxation by exempting the lump sum distribution for a
25 person who is disabled, or 55 years of age or older, or who is
26 the surviving spouse of an individual or is a survivor having
27 an insurable interest in an individual who would have qualified
28 for the exemption for the tax year.
29 The bill excludes the lump sum distribution exempt from
30 state taxation from being included in calculating the
31 individual income tax filing thresholds in Code section
32 422.5(2) and (3).
33 The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
34 retroactively to tax years beginning on or after January 1,
35 2025.
LSB 1390XD (7) 91
-25- jm/jh 25/26

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 DIVISION X —— ESTIMATED TAX THRESHOLD. Under the bill,
2 a taxpayer filing a return is required to make estimated
3 tax payments if Iowa income tax liability can reasonably be
4 expected to exceed $1,000 or more. Under current law, such
5 a taxpayer filing a return is required to make estimated
6 tax payments if Iowa income tax liability can reasonably be
7 expected to exceed $200 or more.
8 The division takes effect January 1, 2026, and applies to tax
9 years beginning on or after that date.
10 DIVISION XI —— TAX EXPENDITURE REVIEW. The bill specifies
11 that the department administering a tax expenditure (tax
12 credit) is not required to review the tax expenditure if the
13 tax expenditure has been repealed or if a zero amount of the
14 tax expenditure remains available to be awarded or claimed.
15 The bill removes four tax expenditures from tax expenditure
16 review: the Iowa fund of funds program in Code chapter 15E,
17 the wind energy production tax credits under Code chapter 476B,
18 the ethanol promotion tax credit in Code section 422.11N (Code
19 2006), and the minimum tax credit under Code section 422.11B
20 (Code 2018). The bill amends the Acts to align the review of
21 the renewable chemical production tax credit in Code section
22 2.48 with the future repeal of the renewable chemical tax
23 credit program.
