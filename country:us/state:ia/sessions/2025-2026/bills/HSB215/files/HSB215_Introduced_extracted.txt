The bill permits the assignment unless the relative or 30 fictive kin is not licensed to provide child foster care and 31 not approved by HHS to provide services as specified by HHS. 32 The bill includes within the Code chapter 237 (child foster 33 care facilities) definition of âlicenseeâ, an individual who 34 has been approved by HHS to provide child foster care. 35 -14- LSB 1459XD (3) 91 dg/ko 14/ 17 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ The bill makes several changes to Code chapter 237 and to 1 Code sections 232.78 (temporary custody of a child pursuant to 2 ex parte court order), 232.98 (hearing concerning temporary 3 removal), 232.102 (transfer of legal custody of child and 4 placement), 234.1 (child and family services ââ definitions), 5 234.39 (child and family services ââ responsibility for costs 6 of services), 237A.3A (child development homes), and 423.3 7 (streamlined sales and use tax Act ââ exemptions). 8 DIVISION III ââ CHILD AND DEPENDENT ADULT ABUSE. The bill 9 makes child abuse information and information obtained in the 10 course of an assessment or evaluation of a report of dependent 11 adult abuse confidential records. 12 The bill allows a community-based entity to apply for and 13 receive funds appropriated to HHS by the general assembly 14 for child abuse prevention. Under current law, only a 15 community-based volunteer coalition or council can apply for 16 and receive such funds. 17 The bill defines âexploitation of a dependent adultâ as a 18 fraudulent, illegal, unauthorized, or otherwise improper act or 19 process of an individual, including a caregiver or a fiduciary, 20 that results in the use of a dependent adultâs resources 21 for the financial or personal benefit, profit, or gain of a 22 person other than the dependent adult, or the deprivation of a 23 dependent adultâs rightful access to or use of the dependent 24 adultâs benefits, resources, belongings, or assets. 25 Under current law, upon a showing of probable cause that 26 a dependent adult has been financially exploited a court may 27 authorize a person, who is also authorized by HHS, to gain 28 access to the financial records of the dependent adult. The 29 bill amends the statute so the person authorized by the court 30 and HHS can gain access to financial records that HHS has a 31 reasonable belief are related to the financial resources of the 32 dependent adult. 33 The bill authorizes an instrumentality of the state to 34 access dependent adult abuse records if the instrumentality 35 -15- LSB 1459XD (3) 91 dg/ko 15/ 17 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ is under contract with HHS to carry out official duties and 1 functions of the dependent adult abuse registry. 2 The bill requires the director of HHS to require providers 3 under the medical assistance program to share information with 4 HHS as necessary to identify, prevent, or respond to child or 5 dependent adult abuse. 6 The bill makes conforming changes to Code section 235B.6 7 (dependent adult abuse services ââ authorized access). 8 DIVISION IV ââ DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ââ 9 CONFIDENTIALITY OF INTERNAL AUDIT AND EXAMINATION INFORMATION. 10 The bill makes information, including workpapers, created 11 or received by HHS during an internal audit or examination 12 (information) confidential. HHS may disclose the information 13 as necessary to complete an audit or examination, to comply 14 with a state or federal law, or to allow an HHS representative 15 to testify in court. The information becomes public record 16 upon completion of the internal audit or examination to which 17 the information pertains. The bill also prevents the state 18 auditor from accessing the information except as required to 19 comply with the standards for engagement described in Code 20 section 11.3 (when audits and examinations begin), to comply 21 with state or federal regulations, or in case of alleged or 22 suspected embezzlement or theft. 23 DIVISION V ââ REGION INCENTIVE FUND ââ DISTRIBUTIONS AND 24 TRANSFERS. The bill appropriates from the region incentive 25 fund of the mental health and disability services regional 26 service fund to HHS for FY 2024-2025, an amount as necessary to 27 ensure the continuity of care for persons transferring services 28 from the mental health and disability services system to the 29 behavioral health services system (BHSS) and establish the 30 BHSS. The moneys may be distributed to and used by an ASO for 31 expenses related to the purposes described in the bill. The 32 moneys used by an ASO do not count toward the ASOâs 7 percent 33 limit on administrative costs. 34 The bill requires any unobligated and unencumbered moneys 35 -16- LSB 1459XD (3) 91 dg/ko 16/ 17 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ remaining in the mental health and disability services regional 1 service fund on June 30, 2025, to be transferred to the 2 behavioral health fund. 3 This division of the bill is effective upon enactment. 4 -17- LSB 1459XD (3) 91 dg/ko 17/ 17

EFFECTIVE DATE. This division of this Act, being 8 deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment. 9 EXPLANATION 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 11 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 12 This bill relates to matters under the purview of the 13 department of health and human services (HHS). 14 DIVISION I ââ ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS. The 15 bill excludes persons employed by an administrative services 16 organization (ASO) from the definition of an employee for the 17 purposes of the Iowa public employeesâ retirement system. 18 The bill prohibits an ASO, or an officer or an employee 19 of an ASO, from acting as a countyâs advocate to represent 20 the interests of patients involuntarily hospitalized by the 21 court in matters relating to a patientâs hospitalization or 22 treatment. 23 DIVISION II ââ CHILD FOSTER CARE. Under current law, a 24 personâs periodic support payments pursuant to an order or 25 judgment are deemed assigned to HHS if the person is or has 26 a child receiving foster care services. The assignment does 27 not apply when a child is placed with a relative or fictive 28 kin of the child who is not licensed to provide child foster 29 care. The bill permits the assignment unless the relative or 30 fictive kin is not licensed to provide child foster care and 31 not approved by HHS to provide services as specified by HHS. 32 The bill includes within the Code chapter 237 (child foster 33 care facilities) definition of âlicenseeâ, an individual who 34 has been approved by HHS to provide child foster care. 35 -14- LSB 1459XD (3) 91 dg/ko 14/ 17 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ The bill makes several changes to Code chapter 237 and to 1 Code sections 232.78 (temporary custody of a child pursuant to 2 ex parte court order), 232.98 (hearing concerning temporary 3 removal), 232.102 (transfer of legal custody of child and 4 placement), 234.1 (child and family services ââ definitions), 5 234.39 (child and family services ââ responsibility for costs 6 of services), 237A.3A (child development homes), and 423.3 7 (streamlined sales and use tax Act ââ exemptions). 8 DIVISION III ââ CHILD AND DEPENDENT ADULT ABUSE. The bill 9 makes child abuse information and information obtained in the 10 course of an assessment or evaluation of a report of dependent 11 adult abuse confidential records. 12 The bill allows a community-based entity to apply for and 13 receive funds appropriated to HHS by the general assembly 14 for child abuse prevention. Under current law, only a 15 community-based volunteer coalition or council can apply for 16 and receive such funds. 17 The bill defines âexploitation of a dependent adultâ as a 18 fraudulent, illegal, unauthorized, or otherwise improper act or 19 process of an individual, including a caregiver or a fiduciary, 20 that results in the use of a dependent adultâs resources 21 for the financial or personal benefit, profit, or gain of a 22 person other than the dependent adult, or the deprivation of a 23 dependent adultâs rightful access to or use of the dependent 24 adultâs benefits, resources, belongings, or assets. 25 Under current law, upon a showing of probable cause that 26 a dependent adult has been financially exploited a court may 27 authorize a person, who is also authorized by HHS, to gain 28 access to the financial records of the dependent adult. The 29 bill amends the statute so the person authorized by the court 30 and HHS can gain access to financial records that HHS has a 31 reasonable belief are related to the financial resources of the 32 dependent adult. 33 The bill authorizes an instrumentality of the state to 34 access dependent adult abuse records if the instrumentality 35 -15- LSB 1459XD (3) 91 dg/ko 15/ 17 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ is under contract with HHS to carry out official duties and 1 functions of the dependent adult abuse registry. 2 The bill requires the director of HHS to require providers 3 under the medical assistance program to share information with 4 HHS as necessary to identify, prevent, or respond to child or 5 dependent adult abuse. 6 The bill makes conforming changes to Code section 235B.6 7 (dependent adult abuse services ââ authorized access). 8 DIVISION IV ââ DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ââ 9 CONFIDENTIALITY OF INTERNAL AUDIT AND EXAMINATION INFORMATION. 10 The bill makes information, including workpapers, created 11 or received by HHS during an internal audit or examination 12 (information) confidential. HHS may disclose the information 13 as necessary to complete an audit or examination, to comply 14 with a state or federal law, or to allow an HHS representative 15 to testify in court. The information becomes public record 16 upon completion of the internal audit or examination to which 17 the information pertains. The bill also prevents the state 18 auditor from accessing the information except as required to 19 comply with the standards for engagement described in Code 20 section 11.3 (when audits and examinations begin), to comply 21 with state or federal regulations, or in case of alleged or 22 suspected embezzlement or theft. 23 DIVISION V ââ REGION INCENTIVE FUND ââ DISTRIBUTIONS AND 24 TRANSFERS. The bill appropriates from the region incentive 25 fund of the mental health and disability services regional 26 service fund to HHS for FY 2024-2025, an amount as necessary to 27 ensure the continuity of care for persons transferring services 28 from the mental health and disability services system to the 29 behavioral health services system (BHSS) and establish the 30 BHSS. The moneys may be distributed to and used by an ASO for 31 expenses related to the purposes described in the bill. The 32 moneys used by an ASO do not count toward the ASOâs 7 percent 33 limit on administrative costs. 34 The bill requires any unobligated and unencumbered moneys 35 -16- LSB 1459XD (3) 91 dg/ko 16/ 17 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ remaining in the mental health and disability services regional 1 service fund on June 30, 2025, to be transferred to the 2 behavioral health fund. 3 This division of the bill is effective upon enactment. 4 -17- LSB 1459XD (3) 91 dg/ko 17/ 17
