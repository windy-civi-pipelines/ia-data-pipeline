Senate Study Bill 1052 - Introduced SENATE FILE _____ BY (PROPOSED COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BILL BY CHAIRPERSON KLIMESH) A BILL FOR An Act enacting the physician assistant licensure compact. 1 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF IOWA: 2 TLSB 1743XC (4) 91 ss/ko S.F. _____ Section 1. NEW SECTION . 147J.1 Physician assistant 1 licensure compact. 2 1. Purpose. In order to strengthen access to medical 3 services, and in recognition of the advances in the delivery 4 of medical services, the participating states of the physician 5 assistant licensure compact have allied in common purpose to 6 develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing 7 authority of state licensing boards to license and discipline 8 physician assistants and seeks to enhance the portability 9 of a license to practice as a physician assistant while 10 safeguarding the safety of patients. This compact allows 11 medical services to be provided by physician assistants, via 12 the mutual recognition of the licenseeâs qualifying license by 13 other compact participating states. This compact also adopts 14 the prevailing standard for physician assistant licensure and 15 affirms that the practice and delivery of medical services by 16 the physician assistant occurs where the patient is located at 17 the time of the patient encounter, and therefore requires the 18 physician assistant to be under the jurisdiction of the state 19 licensing board where the patient is located. State licensing 20 boards that participate in this compact retain the jurisdiction 21 to impose adverse action against a compact privilege in that 22 state issued to a physician assistant through the procedures 23 of this compact. The physician assistant licensure compact 24 will alleviate burdens for military families by allowing active 25 duty military personnel and their spouses to obtain a compact 26 privilege based on having an unrestricted license in good 27 standing from a participating state. 28 2.

Raw Text:
Senate Study Bill 1052 - Introduced SENATE FILE _____ BY (PROPOSED COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BILL BY CHAIRPERSON KLIMESH) A BILL FOR An Act enacting the physician assistant licensure compact. 1 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF IOWA: 2 TLSB 1743XC (4) 91 ss/ko S.F. _____ Section 1. NEW SECTION . 147J.1 Physician assistant 1 licensure compact. 2 1. Purpose. In order to strengthen access to medical 3 services, and in recognition of the advances in the delivery 4 of medical services, the participating states of the physician 5 assistant licensure compact have allied in common purpose to 6 develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing 7 authority of state licensing boards to license and discipline 8 physician assistants and seeks to enhance the portability 9 of a license to practice as a physician assistant while 10 safeguarding the safety of patients. This compact allows 11 medical services to be provided by physician assistants, via 12 the mutual recognition of the licenseeâs qualifying license by 13 other compact participating states. This compact also adopts 14 the prevailing standard for physician assistant licensure and 15 affirms that the practice and delivery of medical services by 16 the physician assistant occurs where the patient is located at 17 the time of the patient encounter, and therefore requires the 18 physician assistant to be under the jurisdiction of the state 19 licensing board where the patient is located. State licensing 20 boards that participate in this compact retain the jurisdiction 21 to impose adverse action against a compact privilege in that 22 state issued to a physician assistant through the procedures 23 of this compact. The physician assistant licensure compact 24 will alleviate burdens for military families by allowing active 25 duty military personnel and their spouses to obtain a compact 26 privilege based on having an unrestricted license in good 27 standing from a participating state. 28 2. Definitions.
