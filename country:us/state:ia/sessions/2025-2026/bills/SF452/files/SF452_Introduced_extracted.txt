The division provides 2 for a runoff election if none of the choices on the ballot in a 3 certification election receives a majority vote of the members 4 of the bargaining unit voting. 5 The division lowers the required percentage of support 6 from employees in a bargaining unit required for an employee 7 organization that did not submit a petition for certification 8 as the exclusive bargaining representative of a bargaining unit 9 to be listed on the ballot for a certification election from 30 10 percent to 10 percent. 11 The division strikes language prohibiting the EAB from 12 considering a petition for certification as the exclusive 13 bargaining representative of a bargaining unit unless a 14 period of two years has elapsed from the date of the last 15 certification election in which an employee organization 16 was not certified as the exclusive representative of that 17 bargaining unit or of the last decertification election in 18 which an employee organization was decertified as the exclusive 19 representative of that bargaining unit. The division prohibits 20 the EAB from considering a petition for certification as the 21 exclusive bargaining representative of a bargaining unit for 22 one year after the employee organization is not certified in a 23 certification election.

The division 29 provides procedures for administering such dues deductions. 30 EAB DUTIES. The division provides that the EAB may interpret 31 and apply, as well as administer, Code chapter 20. 32 The division strikes language permitting the EAB to appoint 33 a certified shorthand reporter to report state employee 34 grievance and discipline resolution proceedings, to contract 35 -40- LSB 2617XS (4) 91 je/js 40/ 49 S.F. 452 with a vendor to conduct elections, to establish fees to cover 1 the cost of elections, and to retain certain funds collected by 2 the EAB as repayment receipts. 3 STATEWIDE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS FOLLOWING A 4 GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION YEAR.
