EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act takes effect July 1, 2 2026. 3 EXPLANATION 4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 5 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 6 This bill provides for the regulation of delivery network 7 companies (DNCs) and delivery network drivers (drivers). A 8 DNC is an entity that uses a digital network to connect DNC 9 customers to drivers who provide delivery services. 10 During the delivery service periods, the bill requires 11 financial liability coverage to cover the driver in the amount 12 of at least $50,000 for bodily injury to or death of one person 13 in any one crash or collision, $100,000 for bodily injury to or 14 death of two or more persons in any one crash or collision, and 15 $25,000 for injury to or destruction of property of others in 16 any one crash or collision. The insurance required by the bill 17 may be maintained by the driver, the DNC, or both. 18 Under the bill, if the financial liability coverage 19 maintained by a driver lapses or does not provide coverage in 20 the amounts required by the bill, insurance maintained by a 21 DNC must provide the coverage beginning with the first dollar 22 of a claim, and the DNC is required to defend the claim. In 23 addition, insurance maintained by a DNC is prohibited from 24 being dependent on the insurer of a driverâs personal vehicle 25 first denying a claim. 26 The financial liability coverage required by the bill must 27 be provided by an insurer governed by Code chapter 515, or by a 28 surplus lines insurer governed by Code chapter 515I. 29 The bill requires a driver to carry proof of financial 30 liability coverage at all times during which the driver uses a 31 vehicle in connection with the use of a DNCâs digital network. 32 In the event of a crash or collision, the driver must provide 33 the proof of financial liability coverage, upon request, to any 34 directly interested party or insurer, and to any investigating 35 -8- LSB 1352HV (2) 91 th/ns 8/ 10 H.F. 545 police officer. 1 The bill requires a DNC to disclose to a driver in writing 2 the types, amounts, terms, and limits of financial liability 3 coverage provided by the DNC to the driver while the driver 4 uses a personal vehicle in connection with the use of the DNCâs 5 digital network, and the fact that the driverâs own financial 6 liability coverage may not provide coverage during the delivery 7 service period. 8 The bill provides that an insurer may exclude coverage 9 afforded to an insured person under a policy issued to the 10 owner or operator of a personal vehicle for any injury or loss 11 that occurs while the insured is logged on to a DNCâs digital 12 network during the delivery service period. An insurer that 13 excludes coverage in this way does not have a duty to defend 14 or indemnify a claim so excluded from a policy issued by 15 the insurer. An insurer that defends or indemnifies a claim 16 against an insured driver that is excluded under the terms of 17 the driverâs policy has a right of action for contribution or 18 indemnity against an insurer providing financial liability 19 coverage to the driver during the period in which the loss 20 occurred. 21 In addition, the bill provides that in a claims coverage 22 investigation, any involved DNC and any insurer potentially 23 providing coverage must cooperate to facilitate the exchange 24 of relevant information with parties directly involved in the 25 claim. 26 The bill provides that a DNC is not deemed to control, 27 direct, or manage a driver that connects to the DNCâs digital 28 network, or the driverâs personal vehicle, except as agreed to 29 by the DNC and the driver pursuant to a written contract, and 30 that a driver is an independent contractor, not an agent or 31 employee of a DNC. 32 The bill exempts drivers from Code chapters 325A (motor 33 carrier authority) and 327D (regulation of carriers). 34 Under current law, a person who violates provisions relating 35 -9- LSB 1352HV (2) 91 th/ns 9/ 10 H.F. 545 to proof of financial liability coverage (Code section 1 321.20B), including a driver under the bill, is subject to a 2 scheduled fine of $325, or $645 if the person was involved in 3 an accident, among other consequences. There are no penalties 4 set forth in the bill for DNCs that violate the provisions of 5 the bill. 6 Code chapter 321N regulates transportation network companies 7 and restricts certain persons from being eligible to operate 8 as a transportation network company driver. A driver is not 9 subject to the same exclusions while performing delivery 10 services. 11 The bill takes effect July 1, 2026. 12 -10- LSB 1352HV (2) 91 th/ns 10/ 10

EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act takes effect July 1, 2 2026. 3 EXPLANATION 4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 5 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 6 This bill provides for the regulation of delivery network 7 companies (DNCs) and delivery network drivers (drivers). A 8 DNC is an entity that uses a digital network to connect DNC 9 customers to drivers who provide delivery services. 10 During the delivery service periods, the bill requires 11 financial liability coverage to cover the driver in the amount 12 of at least $50,000 for bodily injury to or death of one person 13 in any one crash or collision, $100,000 for bodily injury to or 14 death of two or more persons in any one crash or collision, and 15 $25,000 for injury to or destruction of property of others in 16 any one crash or collision. The insurance required by the bill 17 may be maintained by the driver, the DNC, or both. 18 Under the bill, if the financial liability coverage 19 maintained by a driver lapses or does not provide coverage in 20 the amounts required by the bill, insurance maintained by a 21 DNC must provide the coverage beginning with the first dollar 22 of a claim, and the DNC is required to defend the claim. In 23 addition, insurance maintained by a DNC is prohibited from 24 being dependent on the insurer of a driverâs personal vehicle 25 first denying a claim. 26 The financial liability coverage required by the bill must 27 be provided by an insurer governed by Code chapter 515, or by a 28 surplus lines insurer governed by Code chapter 515I. 29 The bill requires a driver to carry proof of financial 30 liability coverage at all times during which the driver uses a 31 vehicle in connection with the use of a DNCâs digital network. 32 In the event of a crash or collision, the driver must provide 33 the proof of financial liability coverage, upon request, to any 34 directly interested party or insurer, and to any investigating 35 -8- LSB 1352HV (2) 91 th/ns 8/ 10 H.F. 545 police officer. 1 The bill requires a DNC to disclose to a driver in writing 2 the types, amounts, terms, and limits of financial liability 3 coverage provided by the DNC to the driver while the driver 4 uses a personal vehicle in connection with the use of the DNCâs 5 digital network, and the fact that the driverâs own financial 6 liability coverage may not provide coverage during the delivery 7 service period. 8 The bill provides that an insurer may exclude coverage 9 afforded to an insured person under a policy issued to the 10 owner or operator of a personal vehicle for any injury or loss 11 that occurs while the insured is logged on to a DNCâs digital 12 network during the delivery service period. An insurer that 13 excludes coverage in this way does not have a duty to defend 14 or indemnify a claim so excluded from a policy issued by 15 the insurer. An insurer that defends or indemnifies a claim 16 against an insured driver that is excluded under the terms of 17 the driverâs policy has a right of action for contribution or 18 indemnity against an insurer providing financial liability 19 coverage to the driver during the period in which the loss 20 occurred. 21 In addition, the bill provides that in a claims coverage 22 investigation, any involved DNC and any insurer potentially 23 providing coverage must cooperate to facilitate the exchange 24 of relevant information with parties directly involved in the 25 claim. 26 The bill provides that a DNC is not deemed to control, 27 direct, or manage a driver that connects to the DNCâs digital 28 network, or the driverâs personal vehicle, except as agreed to 29 by the DNC and the driver pursuant to a written contract, and 30 that a driver is an independent contractor, not an agent or 31 employee of a DNC. 32 The bill exempts drivers from Code chapters 325A (motor 33 carrier authority) and 327D (regulation of carriers). 34 Under current law, a person who violates provisions relating 35 -9- LSB 1352HV (2) 91 th/ns 9/ 10 H.F. 545 to proof of financial liability coverage (Code section 1 321.20B), including a driver under the bill, is subject to a 2 scheduled fine of $325, or $645 if the person was involved in 3 an accident, among other consequences. There are no penalties 4 set forth in the bill for DNCs that violate the provisions of 5 the bill. 6 Code chapter 321N regulates transportation network companies 7 and restricts certain persons from being eligible to operate 8 as a transportation network company driver. A driver is not 9 subject to the same exclusions while performing delivery 10 services. 11 The bill takes effect July 1, 2026. 12 -10- LSB 1352HV (2) 91 th/ns 10/ 10
