2 subparagraph (1), Code 2025, is amended to read as follows:

4 process to review each deficient practice identified by the

11 final finding of immediate jeopardy or substandard quality of
12 care should be issued. The review shall ensure consistent and
13 accurate application of federal and state inspection protocols

18 This bill relates to the review by the department of
19 inspections, appeals, and licensing (DIAL) of certain deficient
20 practices by nursing facilities (facilities).
21 Under current law, if the director of DIAL determines,
22 based on the findings of an inspection or investigation
23 of a facility, that the facility is in violation of Code
24 chapter 135C (health care facilities) or rules adopted under
25 that chapter, the director may issue a written citation to
