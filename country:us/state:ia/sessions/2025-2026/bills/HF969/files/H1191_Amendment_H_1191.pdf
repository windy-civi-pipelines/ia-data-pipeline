10 thirty-five hundredths percent until June 30, 2009, nine and
11 four-tenths percent until June 30, 2024, and, beginning July
12 1, 2024, nine and fifty-five hundredths percent until June
13 30, 2025, and, beginning July 1, 2025, nine and six hundred

17 changes which are enacted by any session of the general
18 assembly meeting after January 1, 1991, if the increase cannot

21 contribution rate of eleven and three-tenths percent or,
22 beginning July 1, 2009, eleven and thirty-five hundredths
23 percent. The contribution rate increases specified in 1994
24 Iowa Acts, ch. 1183, pursuant to this chapter and chapter
25 97A shall be the only member contribution rate increases for
26 these systems resulting from the statutory changes enacted in
27 1994 Iowa Acts, ch. 1183, and shall apply only to the fiscal
28 periods specified in 1994 Iowa Acts, ch. 1183. After the
29 employee contribution reaches eleven and three-tenths percent
30 or eleven and thirty-five hundredths percent, as applicable,
31 sixty percent of the additional cost of such statutory changes
32 shall be paid by employers under paragraph “c” and forty percent
33 of the additional cost shall be paid by employees under this
34 paragraph.>
