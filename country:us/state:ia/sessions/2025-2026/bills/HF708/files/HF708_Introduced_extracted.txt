The bill removes 13 this requirement and requires a hospice program to provide 14 care directed at symptom management to be eligible to receive 15 a license. 16 Under the bill, if a patient who has a terminal condition, 17 and is comatose, incompetent, or incapable of communication, 18 and has not expressed their desire regarding palliative care 19 or a hospice program, certain individuals in order of priority 20 have the authority to make the decision to place the patient in 21 a hospice program. The individuals who have the authority to 22 make such a decision include an attorney in fact, a guardian, 23 the patientâs spouse, an adult child or stepchild, a parent 24 or stepparent, adult sibling or adult stepsibling, a relative 25 of the patient, and a close adult friend. The bill defines 26 close adult friend. An individual making a decision for such a 27 patient shall be guided by the express or implied intention of 28 the patient in making the decision. 29 Current law provides that certain individuals in order 30 of priority, including an attorney in fact, a guardian, 31 the patientâs spouse, an adult child, a parent, and an 32 adult sibling, have the authority to withhold or withdraw 33 life-sustaining procedures from a patient who has a terminal 34 condition, and who is comatose, incompetent, or incapable 35 -8- LSB 1139YH (8) 91 lh/ko 8/ 9 H.F. 708 of communication, and who has not made a declaration for 1 life-sustaining procedures. The bill broadens these categories 2 to include stepchildren, stepparents, and stepsiblings, 3 relatives of the patient, and a close adult friend of the 4 patient. The bill provides restrictions on who may act as a 5 witness to the consultation when the decision is made with the 6 patientâs attending physician. 7 The bill provides that resuscitation may be withheld or 8 withdrawn from a patient who has a terminal condition, and who 9 is comatose, incompetent, or incapable of communication, and 10 who has not executed an out-of-hospital do-not-resuscitate 11 order if there is consultation and written agreement between 12 the patientâs attending physician and certain individuals, in 13 order of priority, making the decision. The individuals who 14 are authorized to make such a decision include an attorney 15 in fact, a guardian, the patientâs spouse, an adult child or 16 stepchild, a parent or stepparent, adult sibling or adult 17 stepsibling, a relative of the patient, and a close adult 18 friend. An individual making a health care decision for such a 19 patient shall be guided by the express or implied intention of 20 the patient in making the decision. A witness, as specified 21 in the bill, shall be present at the time of consultation with 22 the patientâs attending physician when a decision is made to 23 withdraw or withhold resuscitation. 24 Current law requires a guardian to obtain court approval 25 before the guardian may consent to the withholding or 26 withdrawal of life-sustaining procedures for a protected 27 person. The bill makes an exception to this requirement and 28 allows a guardian to make a decision for the protected person 29 relating to hospice care, life-sustaining procedures, and 30 resuscitation without court approval in circumstances detailed 31 in the bill. 32 -9- LSB 1139YH (8) 91 lh/ko 9/ 9

Section 144C.2, subsection 16, Code 2025, is amended 32 to read as follows: 33 16. âLicensed hospice programâ means a licensed hospice 34 program as defined described in section 135J.1 . 35 -7- LSB 1139YH (8) 91 lh/ko 7/ 9 H.F. 708 Sec. 9. Section 633.635, Code 2025, is amended by adding the 1 following new subsection: 2 NEW SUBSECTION . 6. Notwithstanding subsection 2 or 3, a 3 guardian may make a decision for a protected person pursuant to 4 sections 135J.3A, 144A.7, and 144A.7B without court approval. 5 EXPLANATION 6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 7 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 8 This bill relates to health care decisions related to 9 palliative care, hospice programs, life-sustaining procedures, 10 and out-of-hospital do-not-resuscitate orders. 11 Current law requires a hospice program to provide palliative 12 care in order to be eligible for a license. The bill removes 13 this requirement and requires a hospice program to provide 14 care directed at symptom management to be eligible to receive 15 a license. 16 Under the bill, if a patient who has a terminal condition, 17 and is comatose, incompetent, or incapable of communication, 18 and has not expressed their desire regarding palliative care 19 or a hospice program, certain individuals in order of priority 20 have the authority to make the decision to place the patient in 21 a hospice program. The individuals who have the authority to 22 make such a decision include an attorney in fact, a guardian, 23 the patientâs spouse, an adult child or stepchild, a parent 24 or stepparent, adult sibling or adult stepsibling, a relative 25 of the patient, and a close adult friend. The bill defines 26 close adult friend. An individual making a decision for such a 27 patient shall be guided by the express or implied intention of 28 the patient in making the decision. 29 Current law provides that certain individuals in order 30 of priority, including an attorney in fact, a guardian, 31 the patientâs spouse, an adult child, a parent, and an 32 adult sibling, have the authority to withhold or withdraw 33 life-sustaining procedures from a patient who has a terminal 34 condition, and who is comatose, incompetent, or incapable 35 -8- LSB 1139YH (8) 91 lh/ko 8/ 9 H.F. 708 of communication, and who has not made a declaration for 1 life-sustaining procedures. The bill broadens these categories 2 to include stepchildren, stepparents, and stepsiblings, 3 relatives of the patient, and a close adult friend of the 4 patient. The bill provides restrictions on who may act as a 5 witness to the consultation when the decision is made with the 6 patientâs attending physician. 7 The bill provides that resuscitation may be withheld or 8 withdrawn from a patient who has a terminal condition, and who 9 is comatose, incompetent, or incapable of communication, and 10 who has not executed an out-of-hospital do-not-resuscitate 11 order if there is consultation and written agreement between 12 the patientâs attending physician and certain individuals, in 13 order of priority, making the decision. The individuals who 14 are authorized to make such a decision include an attorney 15 in fact, a guardian, the patientâs spouse, an adult child or 16 stepchild, a parent or stepparent, adult sibling or adult 17 stepsibling, a relative of the patient, and a close adult 18 friend. An individual making a health care decision for such a 19 patient shall be guided by the express or implied intention of 20 the patient in making the decision. A witness, as specified 21 in the bill, shall be present at the time of consultation with 22 the patientâs attending physician when a decision is made to 23 withdraw or withhold resuscitation. 24 Current law requires a guardian to obtain court approval 25 before the guardian may consent to the withholding or 26 withdrawal of life-sustaining procedures for a protected 27 person. The bill makes an exception to this requirement and 28 allows a guardian to make a decision for the protected person 29 relating to hospice care, life-sustaining procedures, and 30 resuscitation without court approval in circumstances detailed 31 in the bill. 32 -9- LSB 1139YH (8) 91 lh/ko 9/ 9
