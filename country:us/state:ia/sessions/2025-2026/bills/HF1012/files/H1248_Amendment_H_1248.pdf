12 c. An application for reinstatement or reissuance shall
13 allege facts which, if established, are sufficient to enable
14 the commissioner to determine that the basis of revocation,
15 suspension, or forfeiture of the applicant’s license no longer
16 exists, and must disclose if the applicant has engaged in
17 any conduct listed as a cause for licensing action that was
18 not included in the order for suspension, revocation, or
19 forfeiture.
20 d. An application for reinstatement or reissuance shall
21 allege facts which, if established, are sufficient to enable
22 the commissioner to determine that it is in the public
23 interest for the application to be granted. The commissioner
24 may determine that it is not in the public interest if the
25 applicant has engaged in any conduct listed as a cause for
26 licensing action that was not included in the order for
27 suspension, revocation, or forfeiture, or if the applicant does
28 not have the character and fitness to be a licensed appraiser
29 or umpire in this state.
30 e. The burden of proof to establish facts identified in
31 paragraphs “c” and “d” shall be on the applicant.

6 of the forfeiture of a license.
7 2. All proceedings upon the application for reinstatement
8 or reissuance, including preliminary and ancillary matters,

10 shall be docketed in the original case in which the original
11 license was suspended, revoked, or forfeited, if the case
12 exists.
13 3. An order of reinstatement or reissuance shall be based
14 on a written decision which incorporates findings of fact
15 and conclusions of law. An order granting an application
16 for reinstatement or reissuance may impose such terms and
17 conditions as the commissioner or the commissioner’s designee
18 deems appropriate, which may include one or more penalties
19 provided under this chapter. The order shall be a public
20 record and may be disseminated in compliance with chapter 22.
21 4. If an appraiser’s or umpire’s ordered suspension period
22 ends prior to the appraiser’s or umpire’s license expiration
23 date and the appraiser or umpire applies for reinstatement
24 prior to the license expiration date and meets all applicable
25 requirements, the division shall reinstate the license as soon
26 as practicable but no earlier than the end of the suspension
27 period if the division, after a complete review, determines the
28 license should be reinstated.
29 5. If an appraiser’s or umpire’s license is suspended beyond
30 the appraiser’s or umpire’s license expiration date, whether
31 due to an ordered suspension time period or failure to apply
32 for reinstatement prior to expiration, the appraiser or umpire
33 must apply for reissuance.

3 If a contested case proceeding is pending, the forfeiture shall
4 become effective upon conditions as required by order of the

9 7. The commissioner shall not be prohibited from denying
10 an application for reinstatement or reissuance, or bringing
11 an additional immediate action, if an appraiser or umpire
