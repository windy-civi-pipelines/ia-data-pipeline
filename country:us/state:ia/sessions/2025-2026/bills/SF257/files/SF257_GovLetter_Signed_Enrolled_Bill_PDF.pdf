Senate File 257
AN ACT
RELATING TO THE DISPLAY OF A VALIDATION STICKER ON A VEHICLE
REGISTRATION PLATE.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF IOWA:
Section 1. Section 321.34, subsection 2, paragraph a, Code
2025, is amended to read as follows:
a. In lieu of issuing new registration plates each
registration year for a vehicle renewing registration, the
department may reassign the registration plates previously
issued to the vehicle and may adopt and prescribe an annual
validation sticker indicating payment of annual registration
fees. The department shall issue one validation sticker for
each set of registration plates. The sticker Shall must
specify the month and year of expiration of the registration
plates. The sticker shall be displayed only on the rear
registration plate, except that the sticker shall be displayed
on the front registration plate of a truck tractor. A
validation sticker issued for the upcoming registration year
prior to the expiration of the applicable current registration
year does not invalidate the registration, and is not required
to be displayed on the registered vehicle's registration plate

Senate File 257, p. 2
until the owner would be considered to be driving a motor
vehicle with an expired registration under section 321.39.
