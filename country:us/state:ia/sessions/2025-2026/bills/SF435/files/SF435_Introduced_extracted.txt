Civil penalties collected pursuant to this section shall 25 be credited to the general fund of the state. 26 EXPLANATION 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 28 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 29 GENERAL. This bill amends Code chapter 466B, which provides 30 for a number of programs to protect surface water and provide 31 for flood mitigation and watershed management. The bill 32 creates a new Code subchapter which requires a landowner having 33 an interest in property adjoining a public water source (e.g., 34 a watercourse such as a river, stream, or drainage ditch; or 35 -12- LSB 2369XS (3) 91 da/ns 12/ 14 S.F. 435 body of water such as a pond, lake, or reservoir) to establish 1 and maintain a riparian protection measure (measure) in 2 compliance with a riparian protection compliance plan (plan). 3 The plan is derived from a riparian protection inventory and 4 map developed by the department of natural resources (DNR). 5 ADMINISTRATION. The plan must be prepared by the landowner 6 and approved by the division of soil conservation and water 7 quality (division) created within the department of agriculture 8 and land stewardship. The division must act in partnership 9 with commissioners of soil and water conservation districts 10 (commissioners), and in cooperation with a number of other 11 government entities, including the state soil conservation 12 and water quality committee, the water resources coordinating 13 council, and DNR. 14 REQUIREMENTS. Under an approved plan, a landowner must 15 establish and maintain a measure which is either a riparian 16 protection buffer consisting of perennial vegetation, or an 17 alternative riparian protection practice (e.g., erosion control 18 practice or soil and water conservation practice) alone or in 19 combination with a modified riparian protection buffer. The 20 landowner must establish and maintain the measure after the 21 division completes a riparian protection inventory and map 22 which identifies the land subject to riparian protection. A 23 landowner may apply for financial assistance to establish a 24 measure under a number of programs, including cost-share moneys 25 awarded under the authority of the division. 26 EXCEPTIONS. The bill creates a number of exceptions that 27 excuse compliance, including if (1) there is only one riparian 28 landowner; (2) other regulations apply, including storm water 29 outlets regulated by DNR, or a conservation program regulated 30 by the federal or state government; (3) the land is covered by 31 another object or structure; (4) the land is used to produce 32 a designated crop; (5) the land is part of an environmentally 33 designated area (e.g., a forest); (6) the land contains unique 34 geological characteristics; or (7) the land is subject to 35 -13- LSB 2369XS (3) 91 da/ns 13/ 14 S.F. 435 construction. The division may also create other exceptions 1 if it determines that the exception would not interfere with 2 the billâs purposes. 3 ENFORCEMENT. The division is to take enforcement action 4 against a landowner who violates a term or condition of a 5 plan, unless the division allows the commissioners to take an 6 enforcement action in court for the landownerâs violation of 7 the terms of an administrative order (e.g., for violating the 8 terms of a cost-share agreement). If the division enforces the 9 plan, if must first issue a compliance order listing items that 10 the landowner must complete within a specified time but not 11 more than one year after the compliance order has been issued. 12 The bill also prohibits a landowner or another person from 13 engaging in any work to remove or degrade a riparian protection 14 measure, unless the person has obtained authorization. The 15 bill provides a range of civil penalties based on the number of 16 parcels included in the plan and the period that the violation 17 continues after the compliance order was delivered. The 18 amounts of the civil penalties range from $100 to $500 per 19 parcel. 20 -14- LSB 2369XS (3) 91 da/ns 14/ 14

This bill amends Code chapter 466B, which provides 30 for a number of programs to protect surface water and provide 31 for flood mitigation and watershed management. The bill 32 creates a new Code subchapter which requires a landowner having 33 an interest in property adjoining a public water source (e.g., 34 a watercourse such as a river, stream, or drainage ditch; or 35 -12- LSB 2369XS (3) 91 da/ns 12/ 14 S.F. 435 body of water such as a pond, lake, or reservoir) to establish 1 and maintain a riparian protection measure (measure) in 2 compliance with a riparian protection compliance plan (plan). 3 The plan is derived from a riparian protection inventory and 4 map developed by the department of natural resources (DNR). 5 ADMINISTRATION. The plan must be prepared by the landowner 6 and approved by the division of soil conservation and water 7 quality (division) created within the department of agriculture 8 and land stewardship. The division must act in partnership 9 with commissioners of soil and water conservation districts 10 (commissioners), and in cooperation with a number of other 11 government entities, including the state soil conservation 12 and water quality committee, the water resources coordinating 13 council, and DNR. 14 REQUIREMENTS. Under an approved plan, a landowner must 15 establish and maintain a measure which is either a riparian 16 protection buffer consisting of perennial vegetation, or an 17 alternative riparian protection practice (e.g., erosion control 18 practice or soil and water conservation practice) alone or in 19 combination with a modified riparian protection buffer. The 20 landowner must establish and maintain the measure after the 21 division completes a riparian protection inventory and map 22 which identifies the land subject to riparian protection. A 23 landowner may apply for financial assistance to establish a 24 measure under a number of programs, including cost-share moneys 25 awarded under the authority of the division. 26 EXCEPTIONS. The bill creates a number of exceptions that 27 excuse compliance, including if (1) there is only one riparian 28 landowner; (2) other regulations apply, including storm water 29 outlets regulated by DNR, or a conservation program regulated 30 by the federal or state government; (3) the land is covered by 31 another object or structure; (4) the land is used to produce 32 a designated crop; (5) the land is part of an environmentally 33 designated area (e.g., a forest); (6) the land contains unique 34 geological characteristics; or (7) the land is subject to 35 -13- LSB 2369XS (3) 91 da/ns 13/ 14 S.F. 435 construction. The division may also create other exceptions 1 if it determines that the exception would not interfere with 2 the billâs purposes. 3 ENFORCEMENT. The division is to take enforcement action 4 against a landowner who violates a term or condition of a 5 plan, unless the division allows the commissioners to take an 6 enforcement action in court for the landownerâs violation of 7 the terms of an administrative order (e.g., for violating the 8 terms of a cost-share agreement). If the division enforces the 9 plan, if must first issue a compliance order listing items that 10 the landowner must complete within a specified time but not 11 more than one year after the compliance order has been issued. 12 The bill also prohibits a landowner or another person from 13 engaging in any work to remove or degrade a riparian protection 14 measure, unless the person has obtained authorization. The 15 bill provides a range of civil penalties based on the number of 16 parcels included in the plan and the period that the violation 17 continues after the compliance order was delivered. The 18 amounts of the civil penalties range from $100 to $500 per 19 parcel. 20 -14- LSB 2369XS (3) 91 da/ns 14/ 14
