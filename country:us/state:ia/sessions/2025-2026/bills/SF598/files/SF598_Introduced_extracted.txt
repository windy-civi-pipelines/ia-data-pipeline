This Act applies 2 retroactively to assessment years beginning on or after January 3 1, 2025. 4 EXPLANATION 5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 6 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 7 This bill repeals Code section 405.1, which authorizes a 8 county board of supervisors to adopt an ordinance providing 9 that property acquired and subdivided for development of 10 housing shall continue to be assessed for taxation in the 11 manner that it was prior to the acquisition for housing until 12 the lot is sold for construction or occupancy of housing or 13 five years from the date of subdivision, whichever is shorter. 14 Code section 405.1 also authorizes time extensions of certain 15 ordinances that affect the assessment of property subdivided 16 for development of housing and authorizes the time extensions 17 of certain ordinances by counties and by cities in the portion 18 of the applicable area located in the incorporated area of 19 the city. Additionally, the Code section authorizes cities 20 and counties to adopt, amend, or extend such ordinances and 21 provides that property acquired and subdivided for development 22 of housing shall continue to be assessed for taxation and taxed 23 in the manner it was prior to its acquisition for housing until 24 the lot is sold for construction or occupancy of housing. 25 Code section 441.72 provides that a platted lot for which 26 a subdivision plat was recorded is assessed for property tax 27 purposes as acreage or unimproved property for five years or 28 until the lot is actually improved with permanent construction, 29 whichever occurs first. However, for subdivision plats 30 recorded on or after January 1, 2004, but before January 1, 31 2011, the time limit is eight years. 32 The bill modifies Code section 441.72(1) relating to the 33 five-year limitation by specifying when a subdivision plat 34 is recorded, the individual lots within the subdivision plat 35 -3- LSB 2625SV (3) 91 jm/md 3/ 4 S.F. 598 shall continue to be classified and assessed for taxation in 1 the manner the property was prior to the recording of the 2 plat for five years or until the lot is actually improved 3 with permanent construction, whichever occurs first. The 4 bill strikes portions of Code section 441.72(2) relating to 5 the eight-year limitation. The bill provides that, unless 6 the owner elects to withdraw the property from the provisions 7 established in the bill, for property acquired for development 8 on or after January 1, 2020, or property owned for development 9 upon which development activities occur on or after January 10 1, 2020, such property shall continue to be classified and 11 assessed for taxation in the same manner as the property 12 was prior to the acquisition or commencement of development 13 activities, the assessor shall not change the classification 14 and assessment of the property or a lot on the property while 15 development is occurring until the property or lot is improved 16 with a new permanent structure or is sold. The bill allows 17 owners of such property to withdraw the property from this 18 new provision. If such an election is made, the property is 19 subject to the assessment and classification provisions in Code 20 section 441.71(1), as amended in the bill. 21 The bill defines âdevelopmentâ to include reconstruction, 22 zoning changes, clearing lots, depositing fill dirt, and 23 installing streets and public utilities on the lots. 24 The bill specifies nothing shall be construed to require the 25 refund or modification of property taxes that are attributable 26 to assessment years beginning before January 1, 2025, or 27 the adjustment of property assessments for assessment years 28 beginning before January 1, 2025. 29 The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies 30 retroactively to assessment years beginning on or after January 31 1, 2025. 32 -4- LSB 2625SV (3) 91 jm/md 4/ 4

This Act applies 2 retroactively to assessment years beginning on or after January 3 1, 2025. 4 EXPLANATION 5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 6 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 7 This bill repeals Code section 405.1, which authorizes a 8 county board of supervisors to adopt an ordinance providing 9 that property acquired and subdivided for development of 10 housing shall continue to be assessed for taxation in the 11 manner that it was prior to the acquisition for housing until 12 the lot is sold for construction or occupancy of housing or 13 five years from the date of subdivision, whichever is shorter. 14 Code section 405.1 also authorizes time extensions of certain 15 ordinances that affect the assessment of property subdivided 16 for development of housing and authorizes the time extensions 17 of certain ordinances by counties and by cities in the portion 18 of the applicable area located in the incorporated area of 19 the city. Additionally, the Code section authorizes cities 20 and counties to adopt, amend, or extend such ordinances and 21 provides that property acquired and subdivided for development 22 of housing shall continue to be assessed for taxation and taxed 23 in the manner it was prior to its acquisition for housing until 24 the lot is sold for construction or occupancy of housing. 25 Code section 441.72 provides that a platted lot for which 26 a subdivision plat was recorded is assessed for property tax 27 purposes as acreage or unimproved property for five years or 28 until the lot is actually improved with permanent construction, 29 whichever occurs first.

The 4 bill strikes portions of Code section 441.72(2) relating to 5 the eight-year limitation. The bill provides that, unless 6 the owner elects to withdraw the property from the provisions 7 established in the bill, for property acquired for development 8 on or after January 1, 2020, or property owned for development 9 upon which development activities occur on or after January 10 1, 2020, such property shall continue to be classified and 11 assessed for taxation in the same manner as the property 12 was prior to the acquisition or commencement of development 13 activities, the assessor shall not change the classification 14 and assessment of the property or a lot on the property while 15 development is occurring until the property or lot is improved 16 with a new permanent structure or is sold.
