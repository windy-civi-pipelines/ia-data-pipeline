The 17 seizure education program shall be consistent with guidelines 18 published by the epilepsy foundation of America or any 19 successor organization, and participation in the program shall 20 be optional. 21 The bill makes a school, a school employee, or an agent of 22 a school acting reasonably, in good faith, and in compliance 23 with a studentâs individual health plan and seizure action 24 plan immune from liability for any claim for injuries or 25 damages arising from actions taken to assist a student with the 26 studentâs needs related to epilepsy or a seizure disorder. 27 The bill requires the department of education to convene 28 and provide administrative support to a health care-related 29 training for school personnel group.
