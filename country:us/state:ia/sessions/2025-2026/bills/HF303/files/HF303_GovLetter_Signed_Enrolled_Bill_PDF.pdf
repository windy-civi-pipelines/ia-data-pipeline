(2) Within ten calendar days after receipt for nonurgent
requests.
(3) Within fifteen calendar days after receipt for

pursuant to the reporting procedures and deadlines established
by the commissioner. The commissioner shall publish, within

House File 303, p. 2
sixty calendar days of receipt, the report on a publicly
accessible internet site. The annual report shall include all
of the following:
(1) The total number of, and percentage of, urgent prior
authorization requests that the utilization review organization
approved, aggregated for all health care services and items.
(2) The total number of, and percentage of, urgent prior
authorization requests that the utilization review organization

(3) The total number of, and percentage of, nonurgent prior
authorization requests that the utilization review organization
approved, aggregated for all health care services or items.
(4) The total number of, and percentage of, nonurgent prior
authorization requests that the utilization review organization
denied, aggregated for all health care services or items.
(5) The total number of, and percentage of, nonurgent
prior authorization requests that were complex or involved
unique circumstances that the utilization review organization
approved, aggregated for all health care services or items.
(6) The average and median time that elapsed between the

determination by the utilization review organization for the
urgent prior authorization request, aggregated for all health
care services or items.
NEW SUBSECTION. 2A. a. A utilization review organization
shall, at least annually, review all health care services for
which the health benefit plan requires prior authorization and
shall eliminate prior authorization requirements for health
care services for which prior authorization requests are

House File 303, p. 3
routinely approved with such frequency as to demonstrate that
the prior authorization requirement does not promote health
care quality, or reduce health care spending, to a degree
sufficient to justify the health benefit plan's administrative
costs to require the prior authorization.
b. A utilization review organization shall submit an annual
report containing the findings of the review conducted under
paragraph 'a- to the commissioner pursuant to the reporting
procedures and deadlines established by the commissioner. The
commission shall publish, within sixty days of receipt, the
report on a publicly accessible internet site. The annual
report shall include all of the following:
(1) The total number of prior authorizations the
utilization review organization evaluated as part of the annual
review.
(2) The number of prior authorizations the utilization
review organization eliminated as a result of the annual
review, and the reason for the elimination.
(3) A list of prior authorizations that had at least eighty
percent of requests approved in the previous twelve months for
a specific health care service covered by a health benefit
plan, but which prior authorizations were retained due to
medical or scientific evidence, as defined in section 514J.102,
that justified continuing such requirement.
(4) The total number of prior authorization requests
submitted in the previous twelve months for each eliminated
prior authorization, and the total number of health care
providers that submitted a request for prior authorization
in the previous twelve months for each eliminated prior
authorization requirement.
(5) For each health care service for which prior
authorization was eliminated under subparagraph ( 2), the report
shall include data regarding any increase or decrease of ten
percent or greater in the average number of claims submitted
per health care provider for that health care service compared
to the twelve months immediately preceding the elimination of
the prior authorization.
NEW SUBSECTION. 3A. Complaints regarding a utilization
review organization's compliance with this chapter may be

House File 303, p. 4
directed to the insurance division. The insurance division
shall notify a utilization review organization of all
complaints regarding the utilization review organization's
noncompliance with this chapter. All complaints received
pursuant to this subsection shall not be considered public
records for purposes of chapter 22.
