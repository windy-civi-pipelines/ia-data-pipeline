The Iowa 7 child and dependent care tax credit is a refundable credit 8 calculated as a percentage of the federal child and dependent 9 care tax credit, depending on the Iowa net income of the 10 taxpayer. Currently, there are seven graduated Iowa net income 11 thresholds used to calculate the credit. This division strikes 12 the Iowa net income thresholds, and specifies a taxpayer may 13 claim a tax credit to reduce Iowa net income equal to the 14 amount of the child and dependent care credit of the federal 15 child and dependent care credit provided in section 21 of 16 the Internal Revenue Code, without regard to whether or not 17 the federal credit was limited by the taxpayerâs federal tax 18 liability. 19 The division applies retroactively to tax years beginning on 20 or after January 1, 2025. 21 DIVISION II ââ CHILD CARE WORKFORCE MATCHING GRANT PROGRAM. 22 This division establishes a child care workforce matching grant 23 program (program). Moneys appropriated by the general assembly 24 to the department of health and human services (HHS) for the 25 program must be used to raise wages for persons employed by 26 a child care facility; provide health insurance, paid leave, 27 and retirement benefits for persons employed by a child care 28 facility; raise the quality of the work environment at each 29 child care facility; collect data to assess the needs of 30 persons employed by a child care facility; and assist persons 31 employed by a child care facility to identify sources and apply 32 for benefits for which a person may qualify. The division 33 requires HHS to adopt rules to administer the program. 34 DIVISION III ââ SMALL BUSINESS CHILD CARE TAX CREDIT. 35 -7- LSB 2875YH (6) 91 dg/ko 7/ 10 H.F. 661 This division creates a small business child care tax credit 1 available against the individual and corporate income taxes, 2 the franchise tax, the insurance premiums tax, and the moneys 3 and credits tax. 4 The division defines âsmall businessâ as any enterprise 5 located in this state, which is operated for profit under a 6 single management and which has either fewer than 20 employees 7 or an annual gross income of less than $4 million computed as 8 the average of the three preceding fiscal years. 9 The division allows a small business to receive a tax credit 10 for providing child care employee benefits to employees of the 11 business. The amount of the credit equals the costs to provide 12 the benefit up to $3,000 per employee per year. The aggregate 13 amount of tax credits cannot exceed a total of $2 million per 14 fiscal year and are awarded on a first-come, first-served 15 basis. The division requires a small business to provide child 16 care employee benefits to employees through certain methods 17 in order to be eligible for the small business child care tax 18 credit. 19 The division applies retroactively to tax years beginning on 20 or after January 1, 2025. 21 DIVISION IV ââ STATE CHILD CARE ASSISTANCE. This division 22 relates to state child care assistance (CCA). 23 Under current law, to be eligible for the CCA program, a 24 family must be described by one of six different circumstances 25 and meet income requirements. One of the six eligibility 26 circumstances is that a childâs parent, guardian, or custodian 27 (parent) is employed a minimum of 32 hours per week or an 28 average of 32 hours per week during the month if the child 29 requires basic care, or 28 hours per week or an average of 28 30 hours per week during the month if the child is a special needs 31 child. The division changes the work requirements to 28 hours 32 per week or an average of 28 hours per week during the month for 33 parents of any child. 34 Under current law, a family is required to have income at or 35 -8- LSB 2875YH (6) 91 dg/ko 8/ 10 H.F. 661 below 160 percent of the federal poverty level applicable to 1 the familyâs size (FPL) for a family of a child needing basic 2 care; 200 percent of the FPL for a family of a special needs 3 child; or 85 percent of the state median gross monthly income, 4 whichever is lower. The division sets initial eligibility at 5 the lesser of 85 percent of the state median gross monthly 6 income, or 250 percent of the FPL for families of children 7 needing basic care or 290 percent of the FPL for families of 8 special needs children. 9 The division requires HHS to reimburse child care providers 10 participating in the CCA program at a rate equal to the rate 11 the provider charges a private-pay family for child care. 12 The division provides that HHS shall pay providers based 13 on the number of hours of child care scheduled for a child 14 enrolled in the CCA program instead of for child care provided. 15 The division makes a child eligible for CCA if the child 16 is in a family with a parent, guardian, or custodian who is 17 employed at a child care facility, a child care home registered 18 with HHS, or an unregistered child care home with an agreement 19 with HHS to accept CCA reimbursements; and who meets certain 20 requirements as detailed in the division (qualified parent). 21 The division provides that a director, co-director, or other 22 administrative staff of a child care facility may qualify as 23 a qualified parent if such person is regularly counted in the 24 minimum child-to-staff ratio established by HHS by rule. 25 The division requires a family who participates in CCA to 26 make copayments for services received from the program, if the 27 familyâs eligibility is based on a parent being a qualified 28 parent. 29 The division directs HHS to adopt rules to implement and 30 administer the divisionâs provisions related to qualified 31 parents. 32 The division prohibits HHS from applying waiting list 33 requirements for CCA on persons deemed eligible for CCA due to 34 eligibility based on a qualified parent. 35 -9- LSB 2875YH (6) 91 dg/ko 9/ 10 H.F. 661 The division makes a conforming change by striking Code 1 section 237A.13(6). 2 -10- LSB 2875YH (6) 91 dg/ko 10/ 10

The Iowa 7 child and dependent care tax credit is a refundable credit 8 calculated as a percentage of the federal child and dependent 9 care tax credit, depending on the Iowa net income of the 10 taxpayer. Currently, there are seven graduated Iowa net income 11 thresholds used to calculate the credit. This division strikes 12 the Iowa net income thresholds, and specifies a taxpayer may 13 claim a tax credit to reduce Iowa net income equal to the 14 amount of the child and dependent care credit of the federal 15 child and dependent care credit provided in section 21 of 16 the Internal Revenue Code, without regard to whether or not 17 the federal credit was limited by the taxpayerâs federal tax 18 liability. 19 The division applies retroactively to tax years beginning on 20 or after January 1, 2025. 21 DIVISION II ââ CHILD CARE WORKFORCE MATCHING GRANT PROGRAM. 22 This division establishes a child care workforce matching grant 23 program (program). Moneys appropriated by the general assembly 24 to the department of health and human services (HHS) for the 25 program must be used to raise wages for persons employed by 26 a child care facility; provide health insurance, paid leave, 27 and retirement benefits for persons employed by a child care 28 facility; raise the quality of the work environment at each 29 child care facility; collect data to assess the needs of 30 persons employed by a child care facility; and assist persons 31 employed by a child care facility to identify sources and apply 32 for benefits for which a person may qualify. The division 33 requires HHS to adopt rules to administer the program. 34 DIVISION III ââ SMALL BUSINESS CHILD CARE TAX CREDIT. 35 -7- LSB 2875YH (6) 91 dg/ko 7/ 10 H.F. 661 This division creates a small business child care tax credit 1 available against the individual and corporate income taxes, 2 the franchise tax, the insurance premiums tax, and the moneys 3 and credits tax. 4 The division defines âsmall businessâ as any enterprise 5 located in this state, which is operated for profit under a 6 single management and which has either fewer than 20 employees 7 or an annual gross income of less than $4 million computed as 8 the average of the three preceding fiscal years. 9 The division allows a small business to receive a tax credit 10 for providing child care employee benefits to employees of the 11 business. The amount of the credit equals the costs to provide 12 the benefit up to $3,000 per employee per year. The aggregate 13 amount of tax credits cannot exceed a total of $2 million per 14 fiscal year and are awarded on a first-come, first-served 15 basis. The division requires a small business to provide child 16 care employee benefits to employees through certain methods 17 in order to be eligible for the small business child care tax 18 credit. 19 The division applies retroactively to tax years beginning on 20 or after January 1, 2025. 21 DIVISION IV ââ STATE CHILD CARE ASSISTANCE. This division 22 relates to state child care assistance (CCA). 23 Under current law, to be eligible for the CCA program, a 24 family must be described by one of six different circumstances 25 and meet income requirements. One of the six eligibility 26 circumstances is that a childâs parent, guardian, or custodian 27 (parent) is employed a minimum of 32 hours per week or an 28 average of 32 hours per week during the month if the child 29 requires basic care, or 28 hours per week or an average of 28 30 hours per week during the month if the child is a special needs 31 child. The division changes the work requirements to 28 hours 32 per week or an average of 28 hours per week during the month for 33 parents of any child. 34 Under current law, a family is required to have income at or 35 -8- LSB 2875YH (6) 91 dg/ko 8/ 10 H.F. 661 below 160 percent of the federal poverty level applicable to 1 the familyâs size (FPL) for a family of a child needing basic 2 care; 200 percent of the FPL for a family of a special needs 3 child; or 85 percent of the state median gross monthly income, 4 whichever is lower. The division sets initial eligibility at 5 the lesser of 85 percent of the state median gross monthly 6 income, or 250 percent of the FPL for families of children 7 needing basic care or 290 percent of the FPL for families of 8 special needs children. 9 The division requires HHS to reimburse child care providers 10 participating in the CCA program at a rate equal to the rate 11 the provider charges a private-pay family for child care. 12 The division provides that HHS shall pay providers based 13 on the number of hours of child care scheduled for a child 14 enrolled in the CCA program instead of for child care provided. 15 The division makes a child eligible for CCA if the child 16 is in a family with a parent, guardian, or custodian who is 17 employed at a child care facility, a child care home registered 18 with HHS, or an unregistered child care home with an agreement 19 with HHS to accept CCA reimbursements; and who meets certain 20 requirements as detailed in the division (qualified parent). 21 The division provides that a director, co-director, or other 22 administrative staff of a child care facility may qualify as 23 a qualified parent if such person is regularly counted in the 24 minimum child-to-staff ratio established by HHS by rule. 25 The division requires a family who participates in CCA to 26 make copayments for services received from the program, if the 27 familyâs eligibility is based on a parent being a qualified 28 parent. 29 The division directs HHS to adopt rules to implement and 30 administer the divisionâs provisions related to qualified 31 parents. 32 The division prohibits HHS from applying waiting list 33 requirements for CCA on persons deemed eligible for CCA due to 34 eligibility based on a qualified parent. 35 -9- LSB 2875YH (6) 91 dg/ko 9/ 10 H.F. 661 The division makes a conforming change by striking Code 1 section 237A.13(6). 2 -10- LSB 2875YH (6) 91 dg/ko 10/ 10
