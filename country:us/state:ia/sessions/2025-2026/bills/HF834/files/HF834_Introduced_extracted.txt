NEW SECTION . 476.52A Definitions. 4 As used in this subchapter unless the context otherwise 5 requires: 6 1. âAlternate energy production facilityâ means the same as 7 defined in section 476.42. 8 2. âEnergy storageâ means any system, equipment, facility, 9 or technology that is capable of absorbing energy, storing the 10 energy for a period of time, and dispatching the energy through 11 one of the following manners: 12 a. Using mechanical, electrochemical, thermal, 13 electrolysis, or other processes to convert and store electric 14 energy that was generated at an earlier time for use at a later 15 time. 16 b. Using mechanical, electrochemical, biochemical, or 17 thermal processes to convert and store energy generated 18 from mechanical processes that would otherwise be wasted for 19 delivery at a later time. 20 c. Storing energy in an electric, thermal, or gaseous 21 state for direct use for heating or cooling at a later time 22 in a manner that avoids the need to use electricity or other 23 fuel sources at that later time, such as a grid-enabled water 24 heater. 25 3. âNuclear reactorâ means an apparatus designed to produce 26 electrical or heat energy through sustained nuclear fission in 27 a self-supporting chain reaction. 28 4. âRepoweringâ means either the complete dismantling and 29 replacement of generation equipment at an existing project 30 site, or the installation of new parts and equipment to an 31 existing alternate energy production facility in order to 32 increase energy production, reduce load, increase service 33 capacity, improve project reliability, or extend the useful 34 life of the facility. 35 -1- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 1/ 53 H.F. 834 Sec. 2. Section 476.53, subsection 1, Code 2025, is amended 1 to read as follows: 2 1. It is the intent of the general assembly to attract 3 the development of electric power generating , energy storage, 4 and transmission facilities within the state in sufficient 5 quantity to ensure reliable electric service to Iowa consumers , 6 ensure an adequate base load, and provide economic benefits to 7 the state. Ensuring reliable electric service and providing 8 economic benefits may require public utilities to consider 9 diverse electric power generating technologies and energy 10 storage technologies, including alternate energy production 11 facilities, nuclear reactors, and energy storage facilities. 12 It is also the intent of the general assembly to encourage 13 rate-regulated public utilities to consider altering existing 14 electric power generating facilities, where when reasonable, 15 to manage carbon emission intensity in order to facilitate the 16 transition to a carbon-constrained environment. It is also the 17 intent of the general assembly to encourage the development 18 of nuclear electric power generation within the state using 19 nuclear reactors and to use nuclear power to meet local and 20 regional electric needs. 21 Sec. 3. Section 476.53, subsection 3, paragraphs a, b, c, 22 and d, Code 2025, are amended to read as follows: 23 a. The commission shall specify in advance, by order issued 24 after conduct a contested case proceeding , the ratemaking 25 principles that will apply when the costs of the electric power 26 generating facility or alternate energy production facility are 27 included in regulated electric rates whenever a rate-regulated 28 public utility does seeks ratemaking principles for any of the 29 following: 30 (1) (a) Files an application pursuant to section 476A.3 31 to construct The costs of constructing in Iowa a baseload an 32 electric power generating facility with a nameplate generating 33 capacity equal to or greater than three hundred forty megawatts 34 or a combined-cycle electric power generating facility , or an 35 -2- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 2/ 53 H.F. 834 alternate energy production facility as defined in section 1 476.42 , or an energy storage facility, or the construction 2 costs to significantly alter an existing electric power 3 generating facility , alternate energy production facility, or 4 energy storage facility . For purposes of this subparagraph, 5 a significant alteration of an existing generating facility , 6 alternate energy production facility, or energy storage 7 facility must, in order to qualify for establishment of 8 ratemaking principles, fall into one of the following 9 categories: 10 (i) Conversion of a coal fueled an electric power generating 11 facility into a gas fueled to an alternate fuel type for the 12 electric power generating facility. 13 (ii) Addition of carbon capture and storage facilities at a 14 coal fueled to an existing electric power generating facility. 15 (iii) Addition of gas fueled capability to a coal fueled 16 facility, in order to convert the facility to one that will 17 rely primarily on gas for future generation facilities to 18 capture exhaust heat and thereby generate additional electric 19 power at an existing electric power generating facility . 20 (iv) Addition of a biomass fueled capability to a coal 21 fueled facility. 22 (v) (iv) Repowering of an alternate energy production 23 facility. For purposes of this subparagraph subdivision, 24 ârepoweringâ shall mean either the complete dismantling and 25 replacement of generation equipment at an existing project 26 site, or the installation of new parts and equipment to an 27 existing alternate energy production facility in order to 28 increase energy production, reduce load, increase service 29 capacity, improve project reliability, or extend the useful 30 life of the facility. 31 (v) Addition of energy storage at an existing electric power 32 generating facility, alternate energy production facility, or 33 energy storage facility. 34 (b) With respect to a significant alteration of an 35 -3- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 3/ 53 H.F. 834 existing generating facility, an original facility shall 1 not be required to be either a baseload or a combined-cycle 2 facility. Only only the incremental investment undertaken 3 by a utility under subparagraph division (a), subparagraph 4 subdivision (i), (ii), or (iii), or (iv) shall be eligible 5 to apply the ratemaking principles established by the order 6 issued pursuant to paragraph âeâ . Facilities for which advanced 7 advance ratemaking principles are obtained pursuant to this 8 section shall not be subject to a subsequent commission review 9 pursuant to section 476.6, subsection 19 , to the extent that 10 the investment has been considered by the commission under 11 this section . To the extent an eligible utility has been 12 authorized to make capital investments subject to section 13 476.6, subsection 19 , such investments shall not be eligible 14 for ratemaking principles pursuant to this section . 15 (2) Leases or owns When leased or owned in Iowa, in whole or 16 in part, a new baseload electric power generating facility with 17 a nameplate generating capacity equal to or greater than three 18 hundred forty megawatts or a combined-cycle electric power 19 generating , a new energy storage facility, or a new alternate 20 energy production facility as defined in section 476.42 . 21 b. If the commission finds that the utilityâs application 22 meets the requirements of paragraph âcâ , the commission shall 23 specify by order issued after the contested case proceeding 24 the ratemaking principles that will apply when the costs of 25 the electric power generating facility or alternate energy 26 production facility are included in regulated electric rates. 27 In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the 28 commission shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking 29 principles or traditional cost recovery mechanisms. Among the 30 principles and mechanisms the commission may consider, the 31 commission has the authority to approve ratemaking principles 32 proposed by a rate-regulated public utility that provide for 33 reasonable restrictions upon the ability of the public utility 34 to seek a general increase in electric rates under section 35 -4- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 4/ 53 H.F. 834 476.6 for at least three years after the generating facility 1 begins providing service to Iowa customers. 2 c. In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the 3 commission shall make the following findings: 4 (1) The rate-regulated public utility has in effect a 5 commission-approved energy efficiency plan as required under 6 section 476.6, subsection 15 . 7 (2) The rate-regulated public utility has demonstrated to 8 the commission that the public utility has considered other 9 sources for long-term electric supply and that the facility or 10 lease is reasonable when compared to other feasible alternative 11 sources of supply. The rate-regulated public utility shall 12 provide support of reasonability with an electric utility 13 resource plan pursuant to section 476.53C that has been updated 14 no more than twenty-four months prior to the filing of the 15 public utilityâs application. 16 d. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined 17 in a contested case proceeding , which proceeding required by 18 paragraph âaâ may be combined with the proceeding for issuance 19 of a certificate conducted pursuant to chapter 476A . 20 Sec. 4. NEW SECTION . 476.53B Commission authority and 21 proceedings. 22 The commission shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A 23 to provide for the completion of proceedings under section 24 476.53 within ten months after the date of the filing of an 25 application under section 476.53, subsection 3. The rules 26 shall include reasonable time limitations for the submission or 27 completion of comments and testimony, and exhibits, briefs, and 28 hearings, and may provide for the granting of additional time 29 upon the request of a party to the proceeding for good cause 30 shown. 31 Sec. 5. NEW SECTION . 476.53C Electric utility resource 32 planning. 33 1. An electric utility required to be rate-regulated by the 34 commission shall file a resource plan at least once every five 35 -5- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 5/ 53 H.F. 834 years. A resource plan shall consider all reasonable resources 1 proposed by the utility for meeting the probable future demand 2 for energy, including supply resources and conservation and 3 management of demand. For conservation and management of 4 demand, an electric utilityâs resource plan shall include 5 programs approved in the electric utilityâs most recent energy 6 efficiency plan approved by the commission under section 476.6, 7 subsection 15. The objectives of a resource plan include but 8 are not limited to adequate, cost-effective, and reliable 9 energy service considering costs, fuel diversity, and probable 10 future demand for energy. A resource plan shall not require a 11 specific outcome or specific investment decisions. A resource 12 plan shall reflect the circumstances and management judgment 13 of an electric utility. This section does not restrict an 14 electric utility from making planning decisions based on future 15 resource needs subject to the ratemaking oversight of the 16 commission. 17 2. The commission shall review a resource plan. Within 18 ninety days of filing the final resource plan, the commission 19 shall issue an order acknowledging it has received the plan. 20 In the order acknowledging receipt, the commission may provide 21 recommendations to an electric utility regarding any additional 22 analyses or actions that the electric utility should consider 23 completing in its next resource plan. 24 3. The commission shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 25 17A regarding the timeline and stakeholder process to review 26 and provide comments on the resource plan. The stakeholder 27 process shall include the electric utility organizing and 28 facilitating a stakeholder conference for the resource plan. 29 The stakeholder conference shall include representatives of the 30 commission, the consumer advocate, and the electric utilityâs 31 customers. The electric utility shall make a good faith effort 32 to inform and consider input from the commission, the consumer 33 advocate, and stakeholders. 34 DIVISION II 35 -6- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 6/ 53 H.F. 834 TARIFFS FOR PUBLIC UTILITY INNOVATION PROGRAMS 1 Sec. 6. Section 476.6, Code 2025, is amended by adding the 2 following new subsection: 3 NEW SUBSECTION . 22. Innovative utility programs. 4 a. It is the intent of the general assembly to encourage 5 public utilities to pursue innovation in pricing and programs 6 to meet the dynamic needs of current and prospective customers, 7 enable price-responsive solutions, and to provide economic, 8 environmental, employment, and other benefits to the state. 9 It is also the intent of the general assembly that these 10 new endeavors shall not negatively impact nonparticipating 11 customers. Therefore, the general assembly declares that 12 innovative utility programs are essential to further the 13 attraction and retention of customers to benefit the stateâs 14 economy and to support economical and sustainable energy 15 production. 16 b. (1) A tariff authorized under this subsection shall 17 comply with all of the following conditions: 18 (a) A program created under the tariff shall be available to 19 interested energy customers and customer participation shall 20 be optional. 21 (b) A tariff shall define the eligible customer groups. 22 (c) An eligible customer group shall not exclude directly 23 competing customers in the same customer service territory. 24 For purposes of this subparagraph, âdirectly competing 25 customersâ means customers that make the same end product or 26 offer the same service for the same general group of customers, 27 and excludes customers that only produce component parts of the 28 same end product. 29 (d) Participating customers shall bear all program costs. 30 Program costs include direct costs associated with the 31 construction, operation, maintenance, and interconnection of 32 facilities, including new transmission infrastructure directly 33 arising from the tariff program and costs related to the 34 implementation of tariff programs. Participants in a tariff 35 -7- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 7/ 53 H.F. 834 approved pursuant to this section shall participate in future 1 indirect costs allocated to customers of that utility without 2 regard for the existence of a tariff approved pursuant to this 3 section. 4 (e) A tariff shall not alter the existing base rates or 5 charges of the public utility. Refund, credit, or waiver of 6 existing base rates or charges offered as part of the program 7 shall not be considered an alteration of existing base rates 8 or charges. 9 (f) The program created under the tariff shall not 10 negatively impact nonparticipating customers. Additional 11 costs incurred by nonparticipating customers due to costs 12 arising from the tariff, tariff participants no longer sharing 13 in customer class costs, or decreased customer benefit from 14 existing infrastructure shall be considered negative impacts. 15 (2) A tariff authorized under this subsection may include 16 any of the following: 17 (a) Recovery of costs associated with program-specific 18 services or facilities, including but not limited to energy 19 storage, renewable hydrogen, transmission, electric generating 20 facilities, electric distribution facilities, renewable natural 21 gas generation facilities, renewable natural gas distribution 22 facilities, utility-assisted hourly prices, or liquefied 23 natural gas facilities, or administrative and other overhead 24 costs relating to the same. 25 (b) A negotiated rate of return, for new or existing 26 facilities or services provided by the electric utility that 27 are serving the program created under the tariff, applicable to 28 the program for its duration. The use of existing facilities 29 would require reconciliation of impact to existing customers 30 and would no longer be subject to previously approved advance 31 ratemaking principles. In the event that the tariff or its 32 eligible customer class cease to exist, no charges shall be 33 imposed on or costs recovered from existing customers unless 34 approved in a general rate case. A utility may seek to 35 -8- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 8/ 53 H.F. 834 demonstrate the prudence, necessity, and use and usefulness 1 of program-specific facilities or services as defined in 2 subparagraph division (a) and recovery of costs for the same in 3 a general rate proceeding, without any presumption regarding 4 approval of such request. 5 (c) Application of the program to readily identifiable 6 customer usage patterns, customer characteristics, or output 7 of specified facilities. 8 (d) Assignment of program benefits, including nonmonetary 9 benefits that may derive from dynamically balancing supply and 10 demand, providing ancillary services, or the production of 11 renewable energy attributes. 12 (e) Refund, credit, or waive the base rate or charge for 13 the replaced service when the program created under the tariff 14 replaces a service for which the public utility collects an 15 existing base rate or charge. A participating customer shall 16 pay the costs of remaining services received from the public 17 utility unless those costs are refunded, credited, or waived 18 under the program created by the tariff. 19 (3) If a utility can demonstrate to the commission that 20 a proposed tariff generates excess revenue for the utility 21 as compared to total revenue without the tariff, such excess 22 revenue may be retained by the utility. 23 c. (1) A public utilityâs participation under this 24 subsection is not mandatory. A public utility that elects to 25 propose a tariff or tariff amendment under this subsection 26 shall file an application for approval with the commission. 27 The application shall include an identification of costs and 28 benefits related to the program for the commissionâs review of 29 the conditions specified in paragraph âbâ , subparagraph (1). 30 (2) Within thirty days, the commission shall approve, deny, 31 or docket for further review an application for a tariff or 32 amended tariff submitted pursuant to this subsection. If the 33 application is docketed for further review, the commission 34 shall render a decision within ninety days from the date of 35 -9- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 9/ 53 H.F. 834 application filing unless an objection has been filed with the 1 commission. If the application proposes to amend a tariff 2 previously approved under this subsection, the commission shall 3 not reconsider existing programs previously approved under the 4 tariff unless proposed as part of the amendment. All further 5 review shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to 6 chapter 17A. 7 (3) If the application proposes to amend a tariff previously 8 approved under this subsection as described in paragraph âbâ , 9 subparagraph (2), the commission shall act on the application 10 as described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, but shall 11 not reconsider existing programs previously approved under the 12 tariff unless proposed as part of the amendment. 13 (4) In the exercise of its authority under this subsection, 14 the commission shall not: 15 (a) Limit the number of applications a public utility may 16 file pursuant to this subsection. 17 (b) Deny a tariff because a public utility is subject to an 18 alternative regulatory mechanism, nor require a public utility 19 subject to an alternative regulatory mechanism to record the 20 revenues and costs associated with the program inconsistent 21 with the federal energy regulatory commissionâs uniform system 22 of accounts; provided, however, that this provision shall not 23 prohibit the utilities commission from denying a tariff if the 24 proposed tariff would result in detrimental treatment of other 25 customers, or require adjustment to the calculation of the 26 alternative regulatory mechanism to reflect the impact of an 27 approved tariff. 28 (c) Condition its approval on the public utility changing 29 its proposal if the public utility has not agreed to such 30 changes. This subparagraph division shall not be interpreted 31 to prevent the commission from identifying changes to the 32 proposal that might result in approval. 33 (5) Tariffs and programs approved pursuant to this 34 subsection shall be rebuttably presumed just and reasonable in 35 -10- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 10/ 53 H.F. 834 any subsequent general rate case proceeding. 1 d. The commission shall not condition approval or denial of 2 a tariff on final adoption of rules by the commission. 3 e. The commission shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A 4 to implement this subsection. 5 Sec. 7. APPLICABILITY. This division of this Act applies 6 to a public utility filing an application with the utilities 7 commission for review of a tariff on or after the effective 8 date of this division of this Act. 9 DIVISION III 10 LAND RESTORATION ââ ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION LINES APPROVED BY 11 FEDERALLY REGISTERED PLANNING AUTHORITY TRANSMISSION PLANS 12 Sec. 8. Section 478.16, Code 2025, is amended to read as 13 follows: 14 478.16 Electric transmission lines ââ federally registered 15 planning authority transmission plans. 16 1. Development and investment in high-voltage transmission 17 is urgently needed to ensure the reliable, adequate, secure, 18 and stable delivery of electricity to consumers. To ensure 19 reliable electric service to the people of Iowa as a matter 20 of public policy, it is the intent of the general assembly 21 to express a preference for further investment in Iowa 22 transmission infrastructure by electric transmission owners who 23 have already dedicated significant resources to develop the 24 infrastructure on which Iowans rely and who are better able to 25 provide reliable electric service to local electric utilities 26 and retail customers in Iowa. 27 1. 2. As used in this section , unless the context otherwise 28 requires: 29 a. âElectric transmission lineâ means a high-voltage 30 electric transmission line located in this state with a 31 capacity voltage of one hundred kilovolts or more and any 32 associated electric transmission facility, including any 33 substation or other equipment located in this state . 34 b. âElectric transmission ownerâ means an individual 35 -11- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 11/ 53 H.F. 834 or entity who, as of July 1, 2020, formed, located, or 1 headquartered in any state who owns and maintains an 2 electric transmission line in this state that is required 3 for rate-regulated electric utilities, municipal electric 4 utilities, and rural electric cooperatives in this state to 5 provide electric service to the public for compensation. 6 c. âIncumbent electric transmission ownerâ means any an 7 individual or entity meeting the definition of the following: 8 (1) A public utility or a municipally owned utility that 9 owns, operates, and maintains an electric transmission line in 10 this state. 11 (2) An electric cooperative corporation or association or 12 municipally owned utility that owns an electric transmission 13 facility in this state and has turned over the functional 14 control of such facility to a federally approved authority. 15 (3) An an âelectric transmission ownerâ as defined in 16 paragraph âbâ on or before July 1, 2024 . 17 d. âLandownerâ means the same as defined in section 478.2 18 âInitial constructionâ means the construction necessary to 19 establish and place an electric transmission line into initial 20 operation . 21 e. âLoad ratio shareâ means the amount, expressed as a 22 percentage, of a public power utilityâs electric load divided 23 by the total electric load in the applicable incumbent electric 24 transmission ownerâs pricing zone. 25 e. f. âMunicipally owned utilityâ means a âcity utilityâ 26 as defined in section 362.2 , or an âelectric power agencyâ as 27 defined in section 390.9 which that is comprised solely of 28 cities or solely of cities and other political subdivisions. 29 g. âPublic power utilityâ means a municipally owned utility 30 or an electric cooperative corporation or association that 31 receives transmission service from an incumbent electric 32 transmission owner, or that is subject to regional cost 33 allocation for the electric transmission line, or both. 34 h. âQualified individualâ means someone who is capable and 35 -12- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 12/ 53 H.F. 834 knowledgable enough to determine compliance with the standards 1 set forth in this section. 2 2. 3. a. An incumbent electric transmission owner has the 3 right to construct, own, and maintain an electric transmission 4 line that has been approved for construction in a federally 5 registered planning authority transmission plan and which that 6 directly connects to an electric transmission facility owned by 7 the incumbent electric transmission owner. Where a proposed 8 electric transmission line would directly connect to electric 9 transmission facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric 10 transmission owners, each incumbent electric transmission owner 11 whose facility connects to the electric transmission line 12 has the right to construct, own, and maintain the electric 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that 16 would connect to electric transmission facilities owned by 17 two or more incumbent electric transmission owners, then the 18 other incumbent electric transmission owner or owners that 19 own an electric transmission facility to which the electric 20 transmission line connects has the right to construct, own, and 21 maintain the electric transmission line individually. 22 b. An eligible incumbent electric transmission owner 23 exercising the right to construct, own, and maintain an 24 electric transmission line pursuant to paragraph âaâ shall 25 offer public power utilities an opportunity to jointly own a 26 portion of the electric transmission line and such offer shall 27 be in an amount not less than a public power utilityâs load 28 ratio share, pursuant to a written agreement. Nothing in this 29 section shall be construed to prohibit an incumbent electric 30 transmission owner and a public power utility from agreeing to 31 joint ownership of an electric transmission line in an amount 32 different than the public power utilityâs load ratio share. A 33 public power utility may transfer or assign joint ownership 34 rights acquired under this section to another public power 35 -13- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 13/ 53 H.F. 834 utility or group of public power utilities by mutual consent of 1 the eligible contracting parties. 2 c. An eligible incumbent electric transmission owner 3 exercising the right to construct, own, and maintain an 4 electric transmission line pursuant to paragraph âaâ may 5 contract with another electric transmission owner or electric 6 public utility as defined in section 476.1 to jointly own a 7 portion of the electric transmission line pursuant to a written 8 agreement. 9 d. For purposes of this section, a municipally owned utility 10 or an electric cooperative corporation or association may elect 11 to be an incumbent electric transmission owner or a public 12 power utility but cannot act as both with respect to a single 13 transmission line. 14 3. 4. If an electric transmission line has been approved 15 for construction in a federally registered planning authority 16 transmission plan, and the electric transmission line is 17 not subject to a right of first refusal in accordance with 18 the tariff of a federally registered planning authority 19 and would otherwise be subject to a competitive developer 20 process , then within the later of ninety days of approval for 21 construction or ninety days after enactment of this division 22 of this Act , an incumbent electric transmission owner, or 23 owners if there is more than one owner, that owns a connecting 24 electric transmission facility shall give written notice 25 to the commission regarding whether the incumbent electric 26 transmission owner or owners intend to construct, own, and 27 maintain the electric transmission line. If the incumbent 28 electric transmission owner or owners give notice of intent 29 to construct the electric transmission line, the incumbent 30 electric transmission owner or owners shall follow the 31 applicable franchise requirements pursuant to this chapter . 32 The incumbent electric transmission owner shall update the 33 notice to construct an electric transmission line to include 34 information concerning the implementation of joint ownership 35 -14- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 14/ 53 H.F. 834 as described in subsection 3, paragraphs âbâ and âcâ , within 1 thirty days after a written agreement has been reached between 2 the parties. If the incumbent electric transmission owner 3 or owners give notice declining to construct the electric 4 transmission line, the commission may determine whether another 5 person may construct the electric transmission line. 6 4. 5. For projects where for which an election to construct 7 an electric transmission line has been made under this section , 8 all of the following cost accountability measures shall apply: 9 a. Within thirty days after the issuance of a franchise 10 pursuant to this chapter for the electric transmission line, 11 the incumbent electric transmission owner or owners shall 12 provide to the commission an estimate of the cost to construct 13 complete the initial construction of the electric transmission 14 line. 15 b. Until the initial construction of the electric 16 transmission line is complete, the incumbent electric 17 transmission owner or owners shall provide a quarterly report 18 to the commission, which shall include an updated estimate of 19 the cost to construct the electric transmission line , and an 20 explanation of changes in the cost estimate from the prior 21 cost estimate , and documentation that the incumbent electric 22 transmission owner or owners have used competitively bid 23 construction contracts that meet all the technical, commercial, 24 and other specifications, such as safety performance, that 25 are required by the incumbent electric transmission owner or 26 owners with respect to the initial construction of the electric 27 transmission line . 28 c. The consumer advocate appointed under section 475A.1 29 shall have free access to documents, reports, and information 30 submitted to the commission pursuant to this subsection, 31 consistent with section 475A.4. To the extent relevant, the 32 commission and the consumer advocate may use the information 33 for any purpose properly within the scope of their respective 34 duties including but not limited to use in proceedings before 35 -15- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 15/ 53 H.F. 834 the federal energy regulatory commission to challenge the 1 costs incurred by the incumbent electric transmission owner. 2 However, this subsection does not create a private cause of 3 action or complaint. 4 5. 6. This section shall not modify the authority of the 5 commission under this chapter , the rights of landowners under 6 this chapter , or the requirements, rights, and obligations 7 relating to the construction, maintenance, and operation of 8 electric transmission lines pursuant to this chapter . 9 6. 7. This section shall not apply to an electric 10 transmission line to be placed underground that has not been 11 approved for construction in a federally registered planning 12 authority transmission plan. 13 7. 8.

The Code editor shall designate sections 459C.501 25 through 459C.502, as enacted by this division of this Act, as 26 a new subchapter within chapter 459C, entitled âEnforcement 27 Provisionsâ. 28 EXPLANATION 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 30 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 31 This bill relates to rate-regulated utilities by modifying 32 provisions relating to electric power generation, energy 33 storage, and transmission facility ratemaking principles, 34 creating tariffs for public utility innovation programs, 35 -35- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 35/ 53 H.F. 834 implementing land restoration standards, and modifying the 1 energy infrastructure revolving loan program. 2 Division I of the bill modifies intent language to reflect 3 an intent to attract energy storage and develop nuclear power 4 generation for consumers in the state. 5 Division I of the bill alters ratemaking principle 6 processes and modifies when a rate-regulated public utility 7 may seek ratemaking principles. In addition to electric 8 power generating facilities and alternate energy production 9 facilities, the utilities commission (commission) may specify 10 the ratemaking principles applying to an energy storage 11 facility. 12 Division I of the bill provides that a rate-regulated 13 public utility may seek ratemaking principles from the 14 commission when there are construction-related costs of an 15 electric power generating facility with a nameplate generating 16 capacity equal to or greater than 40 megawatts, an alternate 17 energy production facility, or an energy storage facility, 18 or significant alterations to an existing electric power 19 generating facility, alternate energy production facility, 20 or energy storage facility. Current law generally provides 21 that when a rate-regulated public utility files an application 22 to construct a baseload electric power generating facility 23 with a nameplate generating capacity equal to or greater than 24 300 megawatts or a combined-cycle electric power generating 25 facility or an alternate energy production facility, or to 26 significantly alter an existing generating facility or a new 27 alternate energy production facility, the commission shall 28 specify in advance the ratemaking principles that will apply. 29 Division I of the bill modifies the requirements for a 30 significant alteration of an existing generating facility 31 to qualify for the establishment of ratemaking principles. 32 Division I of the bill provides that to qualify for ratemaking 33 principles, the significant alteration can convert an electric 34 power generating facility to an alternate fuel type, add 35 -36- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 36/ 53 H.F. 834 carbon capture and carbon storage to an electric power 1 generating facility, add a facility to capture exhaust heat to 2 an electric power generating facility, repower an alternate 3 energy production facility, or add energy storage to an 4 existing electric power generating facility, alternate energy 5 production facility, or energy storage facility. Current 6 law provides that to qualify for ratemaking principles, the 7 significant alteration can convert a coal-fueled facility into 8 a gas-fueled facility, add carbon capture and carbon storage 9 to a coal-fueled facility, add gas-fueled capability to a 10 coal-fueled facility, add a biomass-fueled capability to a 11 coal-fueled facility, or repower an alternate energy production 12 facility. 13 Division I of the bill provides that a utility investment to 14 convert an electric power generating facility to a different 15 fuel type, add carbon capture and carbon storage to an electric 16 power generating facility, or add a fuel type to an electric 17 power generating facility shall be eligible to apply the 18 ratemaking principles established by an order issued prior to 19 construction or lease of a facility. 20 Division I of the bill provides that a rate-regulated 21 public utility may seek ratemaking principles for leasing 22 or owning a new electric power generating facility with a 23 nameplate generating capacity equal to or greater than 40 24 megawatts, a new energy storage facility, or a new alternate 25 energy production facility. Current law provides that 26 a rate-regulated public utility leasing or owning a new 27 baseload electric power generating facility with a nameplate 28 generating capacity equal to or greater than 300 megawatts, 29 a combined-cycle electric power generating facility, or a 30 new alternate energy production facility may seek ratemaking 31 principles. 32 Division I of the bill requires the commission to issue an 33 order after the contested case proceeding that the ratemaking 34 principles will apply when the costs of the electric power 35 -37- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 37/ 53 H.F. 834 generating facility or alternate energy production facility 1 are included in regulated electric rates once the commission 2 finds that the rate-regulated public utilityâs application for 3 ratemaking principles meets all the commissionâs requirements. 4 Division I of the bill requires a rate-regulated public 5 utility seeking ratemaking principles to provide support of 6 reasonability with an electric utility resource plan that has 7 been updated within 24 months of filing the application. 8 Division I of the bill requires the commission to adopt 9 rules for proceedings to conclude 10 months after a petition is 10 filed. 11 Division I of the bill requires rate-regulated electric 12 utilities to file a resource plan at least once every five 13 years. The resource plan must consider all reasonable 14 resources by the utility for meeting the probable future demand 15 for energy, including supply resources and conservation and 16 management of demand. For conservation and management of 17 demand, the resource plan shall include programs approved in 18 the electric utilityâs most recently approved energy efficiency 19 plan. The objectives of the resource plan include but are 20 not limited to adequate, cost-effective, and reliable energy 21 service considering costs, fuel diversity, and probable future 22 demand for energy, and should reflect the circumstances and 23 management judgment of the electric utility. The resource 24 plan does not require specific outcomes or specific investment 25 decisions. 26 Division I of the bill directs the commission to issue an 27 order within 90 days of the resource plan acknowledging receipt 28 of the plan. This order may provide recommendations to an 29 electric utility regarding any additional analyses or actions 30 that the electric utility should consider completing in its 31 next resource plan. 32 Division I of the bill directs the commission to adopt rules 33 regarding the timeline and stakeholder process to review and 34 provide comments on the resource plan. The stakeholder process 35 -38- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 38/ 53 H.F. 834 shall include the electric utility organizing and facilitating 1 a stakeholder conference with representatives of the 2 commission, the consumer advocate, and the electric utilityâs 3 customers. Division I of the bill directs the electric utility 4 to make a good faith effort to inform and consider input from 5 the commission, the consumer advocate, and stakeholders. 6 Division II of the bill provides that it is the intent of 7 the general assembly to encourage public utility innovation 8 in pricing and programs, and that the new innovations not 9 negatively impact nonparticipating customers. Division II 10 of the bill additionally provides that it is the intent of 11 the general assembly to attract and retain customers for the 12 benefit of the stateâs economy, support of economical energy 13 production, and support of sustainable energy production. 14 Division II of the bill authorizes a tariff program. 15 Division II of the bill provides that a tariff shall comply 16 with several provisions. The tariff shall be optional for 17 customers, define eligible customer groups, and assess 18 program costs to participating customers. Program costs 19 shall include specified direct costs arising from the tariff 20 program and costs related to the implementation of tariff 21 programs. Participants of a tariff program shall participate 22 in future indirect costs allocated to customers of that 23 utility without regard for the existence of an approved tariff. 24 The tariff shall not allow for an eligible customer group 25 excluding directly competing customers in the same customer 26 service territory, alter existing base rate or charges of 27 the public utility, or negatively impact nonparticipating 28 customers. Negative impacts include additional costs incurred 29 by nonparticipating customers due to costs arising from the 30 tariff, tariff participants no longer sharing in customer 31 class costs, or decreased customer benefit from existing 32 infrastructure. 33 Division II of the bill explains that a tariff may include 34 provisions relating to recovery of costs, rate of return, 35 -39- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 39/ 53 H.F. 834 application of the program to other specified patterns, program 1 benefits, and refunds, credits, or waivers when the program 2 replaces an existing service, or recovery of costs associated 3 with existing facilities. A participating program customer 4 shall pay the costs of the services received from the public 5 utility unless the costs are refunded, credited, or waived 6 under the program. Division II of the bill provides that 7 if the program or eligible customer group cease to exist and 8 the public utility seeks recovery of the program-specific 9 facilities through a general rate case proceeding, the public 10 utility shall demonstrate the reasonableness and prudence 11 without any presumption regarding approval of such request. A 12 public utility shall be allowed to recover program-specific 13 facilities through general rate case proceedings. If the 14 utility can demonstrate to the commission that the proposed 15 tariff generates excess revenue for the utility as compared to 16 total revenue without the tariff, the excess revenue may be 17 retained by the utility. 18 Division II of the bill provides for tariff application 19 and approval. A public utilityâs authority is not mandatory 20 regarding tariffs. Division II of the bill provides that an 21 application for a tariff or amendment to a tariff shall be 22 filed with the commission. The commission shall approve, deny, 23 or docket for further review an application within 30 days. 24 If the commission dockets the application for further review, 25 the commission shall render a decision within 90 days from the 26 date of application filing, unless an objection is filed. The 27 commission shall not reconsider existing programs previously 28 approved under the tariff during a review of an application 29 for an amendment to a tariff unless the review of a program is 30 proposed as part of the amendment. 31 Division II of the bill prohibits the commission from 32 certain actions. Division II of the bill provides that 33 the commission shall not limit the number of applications a 34 public utility may file, deny, or condition the approval of a 35 -40- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 40/ 53 H.F. 834 tariff because a public utility is subject to an alternative 1 regulatory mechanism, or require a public utility subject to an 2 alternative regulatory mechanism to record revenues and costs 3 in an inconsistent manner with specified federal standards, 4 provided that the proposed tariff would not result in 5 detrimental treatment of other customers or require adjustment 6 to the calculation of the alternative regulatory mechanism to 7 reflect the impact of an approved tariff. Division II of the 8 bill prohibits the commission from conditioning approval of a 9 tariff on the requirement that the public utility change the 10 proposal to unagreed-upon terms, but this prohibition does not 11 prevent the commission from identifying changes to the proposal 12 that might result in approval. 13 Division II of the bill provides that tariffs and programs 14 approved pursuant to division II of the bill shall be 15 rebuttably presumed to be just and reasonable in general rate 16 case proceedings. Division II of the bill prohibits the 17 commission from conditioning approval or denial of a tariff 18 on the final adoption of rules and requires the commission to 19 adopt rules related to division II of the bill. 20 Division II of the bill applies to a public utility filing an 21 application with the commission for review of a tariff on or 22 after the effective date of division II of the bill. 23 Division III of the bill relates to electric transmission 24 lines and electric transmission owners. Division III of the 25 bill expounds the legislative purpose of Code section 478.16, 26 identifying Iowa consumersâ urgent need for development and 27 investment in high-voltage transmission. Division III of the 28 bill provides that an incumbent electric transmission owner may 29 be formed, located, or headquartered in any state as long as 30 the electric transmission line is located in Iowa. 31 Division III of the bill defines an âincumbent electric 32 transmission ownerâ as an individual or entity who, as of July 33 1, 2024, owns and maintains an electric transmission line 34 in this state that is required for rate-regulated electric 35 -41- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 41/ 53 H.F. 834 utilities, municipal electric utilities, and rural electric 1 cooperatives in the state to provide electric service to the 2 public for compensation. 3 Under division III of the bill, an incumbent electric 4 transmission facility owner has the right to construct, own, 5 and maintain an electric transmission line that directly 6 connects to the electric transmission facility. If a proposed 7 transmission line would directly connect to facilities owned 8 by two or more facility owners, each owner has the right to 9 construct, own, and maintain the electric transmission line 10 individually and equally. 11 Division III of the bill requires an incumbent electric 12 transmission owner exercising its right to construct, own, 13 and maintain an electric transmission line to offer public 14 power utilities an opportunity to jointly own a portion of the 15 electric transmission line. The offered amount must be at 16 least the amount of the public power utilityâs electric load 17 divided by the total electric load in the applicable incumbent 18 electric transmission ownerâs pricing zone. Division III of 19 the bill does not prohibit the entities from agreeing to joint 20 ownership in a different amount. Additionally, division III of 21 the bill allows the public power utility to transfer or assign 22 its joint ownership rights to another public power utility 23 or group of public power utilities with the consent of the 24 incumbent electric transmission owner. 25 Division III of the bill allows an incumbent electric 26 transmission owner exercising its right to construct, own, 27 and maintain an electric transmission line to contract with 28 another electric transmission owner or electric public utility 29 to jointly own a portion of the electric transmission line. 30 Division III of the bill requires the incumbent electric 31 transmission owner or owners with approved electric 32 transmission lines not subject to right of first refusal 33 in a federally registered planning authority transmission 34 plan to give notice to the commission whether the owner or 35 -42- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 42/ 53 H.F. 834 owners intend to construct, own, and maintain the electric 1 transmission line. The notice shall be given within the later 2 of 90 days of approval for construction or 90 days after 3 enactment of division III of the bill. The commission may 4 determine whether another person may construct the electric 5 transmission line if the incumbent electric transmission owner 6 or owners give notice declining to construct or do not give 7 timely notice. 8 Division III of the bill requires incumbent electric 9 transmission owners to provide documentation to the commission 10 that shows utilization of competitively bid construction 11 contracts that meet all necessary technical, commercial, and 12 other specifications required for compliant construction. 13 Division III of the bill allows the consumer advocate free 14 access to all documents, reports, and information submitted to 15 the commission regarding cost accountability measures for the 16 construction of electric transmission lines. These documents, 17 reports, and information may be used by the consumer advocate 18 for any purpose within the scope of the consumer advocateâs 19 duties. These provisions do not create a private cause of 20 action or complaint. 21 Division III of the bill directs the commission to adopt 22 rules to implement the land restoration requirements after 23 initial construction of an electric transmission line as set 24 forth in division III of the bill. 25 Division III of the bill requires incumbent electric 26 transmission owners to repair drain tiles damaged during 27 construction as soon as practicable and to complete permanent 28 repairs as soon as practicable after initial construction. The 29 permanent repairs must be of the same quality, size, and flow 30 capacity of the original drain tile. 31 Division III of the bill requires incumbent electric 32 transmission owners to remove all nonnative rocks larger 33 than three inches in diameter from the easement area. The 34 disposal of rock that cannot be used as backfill must be done 35 -43- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 43/ 53 H.F. 834 at a location and in a manner agreed to between the incumbent 1 electric transmission owner and the landowner. 2 Division III of the bill requires the incumbent electric 3 transmission owner to till agricultural land affected by 4 construction, including right-of-way access points or roads, 5 after electric transmission line construction activities are 6 completed on the affected property. The land must be tilled 7 at least 18 inches deep in land used for crop production and 12 8 inches deep in all other land, unless otherwise agreed to by 9 the landowner. 10 Division III of the bill requires the incumbent electric 11 transmission owner to restore soil conservation practices 12 and structures damaged during construction to their previous 13 state, compact the soil used to repair embankments intended to 14 retain water, and reestablish any vegetation disturbed during 15 construction, including cover crops. 16 Division III of the bill requires the incumbent electric 17 transmission owner to reseed the agricultural land, excluding 18 row crops and small grain production, following compaction 19 of the land. Seeding for cover crops may be delayed if 20 construction is completed too late in the year and is not 21 required if the land will be tilled the following year. When 22 the season is not suitable for the seeding of cover crops, the 23 landowner may request ground cover to prevent soil erosion. 24 Division III of the bill requires the incumbent electric 25 transmission owner to remove all field entrances and temporary 26 roads used during construction and to restore the areas to 27 their previous state following the completion of the initial 28 construction. 29 Division III of the bill requires the incumbent electric 30 transmission owner to use good practices when constructing in 31 wet conditions and to grade and till any rutted land in order 32 to restore the land to its original condition to the extent 33 practicable. Additionally, division III of the bill allows 34 the landowner to repair damage caused by construction in wet 35 -44- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 44/ 53 H.F. 834 conditions. The incumbent electric transmission owner shall 1 then reimburse the landowner for reasonable costs of repair. 2 Division III of the bill requires an electric transmission 3 owner to utilize mudflats, mats, or other measures to minimize 4 soil disturbance when using heavy equipment in wetlands. 5 Division III of the bill requires the incumbent electric 6 transmission owner to provide contact information to all 7 persons affected by the construction of each transmission line. 8 Division III of the bill allows the commission to appoint an 9 inspector to determine compliance with restoration standards 10 in the event the incumbent electric transmission owner and the 11 landowner dispute over potential violations. The cost of the 12 inspection shall be paid by the incumbent electric transmission 13 owner. If the inspector determines there have been violations 14 of the restoration standards, the commission will provide oral 15 and written notice to the incumbent electric transmission 16 owner. The commission will order corrective actions be taken 17 to comply with the standards. The costs of the corrective 18 actions will be borne by the electric transmission owner. 19 Division III of the bill allows the commission to issue an 20 order requiring corrective action and impose civil penalties if 21 the incumbent electric transmission owner or its contractor do 22 not comply with the required standards. 23 Division III of the bill requires the commission to instruct 24 the inspectors on the statutes, rules, and responsibilities 25 regarding restoration standards. 26 Division III of the bill requires petitioners for a 27 franchise for electric transmission construction to file a land 28 restoration plan outlining how the construction will conform 29 to the required standards. The restoration plan will also be 30 provided to all property owners affected by the construction. 31 Division III of the bill allows alternative provisions in 32 independent agreements with landowners regarding protecting or 33 restoring property as long as these provisions are in writing 34 and are provided to the commission. 35 -45- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 45/ 53 H.F. 834 Division III of the bill allows electric transmission 1 owners to propose alternate methods of land restoration to the 2 commission. The commission, by waiver, may allow variations 3 to the land restoration requirements if the proposed alternate 4 methods would restore the land to a condition as good or better 5 than those required by division III of the bill. 6 Division III of the bill allows the commission to waive the 7 preparation of a separate land restoration plan, in whole or in 8 part, if the incumbent electric transmission owner satisfies 9 the requirements through similar agreement with other agencies 10 in the state. The relevant agreements must be filed with the 11 commission. 12 Division III of the bill does not limit, expand, or otherwise 13 modify the rights of access and obligations for damages set 14 forth in Code section 478.17. 15 Division III of the bill takes effect upon enactment. 16 Division III of the bill applies retroactively to an 17 electric transmission line included in a federally registered 18 planning authority long-term transmission plan approved on 19 or after July 1, 2020, with the exception of the provisions 20 requiring incumbent electric transmission owners to offer 21 public power utilities the option to jointly own qualifying 22 electric transmission lines. For this exception, division III 23 of the bill applies retroactively to July 1, 2024. 24 Division IV of the bill relates to the energy infrastructure 25 revolving loan program, which is renamed as the âenergy and 26 water infrastructure revolving loan programâ. 27 Under current law, the energy infrastructure revolving loan 28 fund (fund) and program are administered by the Iowa energy 29 center (center). Division IV of the bill instead places 30 the administrative duty with the Iowa economic development 31 authority (IEDA) and renames the fund the âenergy and water 32 infrastructure revolving loan fundâ. 33 Division IV of the bill adds financial assistance for the 34 development and construction of water infrastructure that 35 -46- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 46/ 53 H.F. 834 supports economic development to the fundâs approved uses, 1 including drinking water treatment systems and wastewater 2 treatment systems. 3 Division IV of the bill expands the entities eligible for 4 assistance under the fund to include a county or city. 5 Under current law, the approval of the centerâs governing 6 board is required before IEDA can determine the amount and 7 the terms of all financial assistance awarded to an eligible 8 borrower and all agreements and administrative authority are 9 vested in the centerâs governing board. Division IV of the 10 bill removes the approval requirement by the center and its 11 authority regarding agreements. 12 Division IV of the bill adds that to be eligible for 13 a financial assistance award under the energy and water 14 infrastructure revolving loan program, an eligible borrower 15 must demonstrate that the proposed project will attract and 16 encourage the location of new industrial enterprise or the 17 expansion of existing industrial enterprise. Division IV 18 of the bill states that IEDA shall determine the amount and 19 the terms of all financial assistance awarded to an eligible 20 borrower under the program and that all agreements and 21 administrative authority shall be vested in IEDA. Division 22 IV of the bill provides that IEDA may adopt rules for the 23 implementation of this program. 24 Division IV of the bill grants IEDA the ability to authorize 25 the transfer of up to $633,000 annually to Iowa state 26 university of science and technology to be used for providing 27 financial assistance to the state load forecasting center. 28 Division V of the bill relates to anaerobic digester 29 systems. Division V of the bill states its purpose is to 30 provide requirements relating to the construction, including 31 the expansion, and operation of anaerobic digester systems and 32 the control of digestate. Division V of the bill directs the 33 environmental protection commission to make rules for this 34 stated purpose. Division V of the bill states that if the 35 -47- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 47/ 53 H.F. 834 provisions of new Code chapter 459C conflict with Code chapter 1 459, 459A, or 459B, the provisions of Code chapter 459C shall 2 prevail. 3 Division V of the bill directs the department of natural 4 resources (DNR) to approve applications for permits for 5 construction, including expansion, of anaerobic digester 6 systems based on procedures required in division V of the 7 bill and rules created by DNR pursuant to division V of the 8 bill. Division V of the bill prohibits the construction of 9 an anaerobic digester system, regardless of size, until the 10 construction permit has been approved. The applicant must 11 also submit a $250 permit application fee, a written plan for 12 disposal of the digestate, and a written operation plan for an 13 anaerobic digester system. 14 Division V of the bill requires an anaerobic digester 15 system to accept only manure unless DNR otherwise approves the 16 inclusion of organic by-product, food product, or food for 17 human consumption. Nonmanure materials shall not compose more 18 than 10 percent of the total material added to an anaerobic 19 digester system. 20 Division V of the bill requires a daily record of materials 21 added to an anaerobic digester system to be kept and maintained 22 at the facility and grants DNR the authority for additional 23 testing or monitoring of the materials added to an anaerobic 24 digester system and the digestate. 25 Division V of the bill prohibits medical wastes, including 26 expired or unused antibiotics, petroleum products not designed 27 for use in manure storage facilities, pesticides, paints, 28 solvents, hazardous materials, municipal or sanitary waste 29 or sludge, industrial wastewater, contaminated feedstock, 30 slaughterhouse wastes, and residues from processing of food 31 materials that have not been deemed acceptable for human 32 consumption from being processed in an anaerobic digester 33 system. 34 Division V of the bill directs DNR to adopt rules to 35 -48- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 48/ 53 H.F. 834 establish construction design standards for formed manure 1 storage structures that are part of an anaerobic digester 2 system. Division V of the bill requires construction design 3 standards to be based upon uniform standards and provides 4 construction design standards for concrete. 5 Division V of the bill prohibits the construction of 6 unformed manure storage structures on karst terrain, but allows 7 the construction of a formed manure storage structure on 8 karst terrain or an area that drains into a known sinkhole if 9 upgraded construction design standards necessary to ensure that 10 the structure does not pollute groundwater sources are used. 11 Division V of the bill provides separation distance 12 requirements between an anaerobic digester system manure 13 storage structure and a surface intake of a drainage well, 14 wellhead, cistern of an agricultural well, known sinkhole, 15 water source, or wetland. Division V of the bill provides 16 exceptions for a location or object and a farm pond or 17 privately owned lake. 18 Division V of the bill prohibits construction, expansion, 19 or diversion of a water source or the designation of a 20 wetland if the action would cause an anaerobic digester system 21 manure storage structure to be in violation of the distance 22 requirements. 23 Division V of the bill prohibits an anaerobic digester 24 system manure storage structure from being constructed on land 25 that is part of a 100 year floodplain as determined by DNR. 26 Division V of the bill states there are no distance 27 requirements between a location or object and a farm pond or 28 privately owned lake. Additionally, distance requirements 29 do not apply to an anaerobic digester system manure storage 30 structure constructed with a secondary containment barrier 31 approved by DNR. 32 Division V of the bill provides separation distances between 33 an anaerobic digester system manure storage structure and a 34 residence, bona fide religious institution, public use area, 35 -49- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 49/ 53 H.F. 834 commercial enterprise, educational institution, or public 1 thoroughfare. Division V of the bill allows the titleholder 2 of the land benefiting from the distance requirements to waive 3 the distance requirements. Division V of the bill allows the 4 state or political subdivision to waive distance requirements 5 of public thoroughfares. The waivers must be filed with the 6 county recorder before becoming effective. 7 Division V of the bill allows an anaerobic digester 8 system manure storage structure to be within the distance 9 requirement from a residence, educational institution, 10 commercial enterprise, bona fide religious institution, city, 11 or public use area if the anaerobic digester system manure 12 storage structure was operating in conformance with distance 13 requirements, but was brought within the distance requirement 14 due to the expansion or construction of a residence, 15 educational institution, commercial enterprise, bona fide 16 religious institution, city, or public use area. A change in 17 ownership or expansion of an anaerobic digester system shall 18 not change the established date of operation. 19 Division V of the bill requires an anaerobic digester system 20 to retain all digestate produced by operation between periods 21 of digestate disposal or delivery to animal feeding operations 22 and to dispose the digestate in a manner that will not cause 23 surface water or groundwater pollution. 24 Division V of the bill requires the owner of an anaerobic 25 digester system that discontinues the use of the operation to 26 remove all digestate from related anaerobic digester system 27 structures used to store digestate within six months following 28 the date that the anaerobic digester system is discontinued. 29 Division V of the bill requires materials returned to an 30 animal feeding operation for land application be accounted for 31 in the animal feeding operationâs manure management plan or 32 nutrient management plan and that the owner of the anaerobic 33 digester system must satisfy all applicable laws for proper 34 application of any portion of the digestate not returned to an 35 -50- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 50/ 53 H.F. 834 animal feeding operation. 1 Division V of the bill allows an anaerobic digester system to 2 stockpile materials prior to digestation or dry digestate so 3 long as the facility stockpiles the materials and dry digestate 4 in compliance with restrictions applicable to stockpiling as 5 provided in division V of the bill. Division V of the bill 6 prohibits anaerobic digester system stockpiles from commingling 7 with animal feeding operation stockpiles. 8 Division V of the bill provides separation distance 9 requirements between a stockpile and a designated area that 10 includes a known sinkhole, a cistern, an abandoned well, an 11 unplugged agricultural drainage well, an agricultural drainage 12 well surface inlet, a drinking water well, a designated 13 wetland, or a water source. Special separation distance 14 requirements are provided for a high-quality water resource, an 15 agricultural drainage well, or a known sinkhole. Division V 16 of the bill provides special separation distance requirements 17 between a stockpile and a terrace tile inlet or surface tile 18 inlet. An exception allows a stockpile to be located closer 19 than otherwise required from these water sources so long as it 20 is maintained in a manner that will not allow precipitation 21 induced runoff to drain from the material or dry digestate. 22 Division V of the bill also provides separation distance 23 requirements between a stockpile and a residence, bona fide 24 religious institution, public use area, commercial enterprise, 25 or educational institution. 26 Division V of the bill provides that a stockpile cannot be 27 located in a grassed waterway. The stockpile also cannot be 28 located on a slope of a certain grade, unless efforts are taken 29 to contain the stockpile and prevent runoff. 30 If the materials or dry digestate are not stockpiled on 31 karst terrain, division V of the bill does not provide any 32 requirements so long as the materials or dry digestate are 33 stockpiled for 15 days or less. Otherwise, division V of the 34 bill requires a person to comply with stockpiling requirements 35 -51- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 51/ 53 H.F. 834 or file a monthly inspection report with DNR. The special 1 stockpiling requirements include either the use of a structure 2 or the use of an impermeable cover. However, if the stockpile 3 is covered on a long-term basis, it must be sited on compacted 4 or other prepared ground. 5 Division V of the bill states that if a proposed stockpile 6 is located on potential karst terrain, a qualified person must 7 test the ground in conformance with requirements described in 8 division V of the bill and submit a soil report to confirm 9 whether the proposed stockpile location is on karst terrain. 10 If the material or dry digestate is stockpiled on karst 11 terrain, there must be a separation distance between the bottom 12 of the stockpile and the soluble rock, regardless of how long 13 the stockpile is located at that location. For material or dry 14 digestate that is stockpiled for more than 15 days, special 15 compliance requirements apply, including either the use of a 16 structure or an impermeable cover. If the stockpile is located 17 at that location on a long-term basis, it must be sited on 18 concrete. 19 Division V of the bill requires a person stockpiling 20 material or dry digestate to comply with all applicable 21 national pollutant discharge elimination system permit 22 requirements pursuant to the federal Water Pollution Control 23 Act. 24 Division V of the bill requires a person stockpiling 25 materials or dry digestate to remove the dry digestate and 26 apply it in accordance with the provisions of division V of the 27 bill within six months after the materials or dry digestate are 28 first stockpiled. 29 Division V of the bill directs DNR and the attorney general 30 to enforce Code chapter 459C in the same manner as provided in 31 Code chapter 459, subchapter VI. A person who violates the 32 provisions of division V of the bill for which the alleged harm 33 is related to air quality shall be subject to the same penalty 34 as provided in Code section 459.602. A person who violates 35 -52- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 52/ 53 H.F. 834 the provisions of division V of the bill for which the alleged 1 harm is related to water quality shall be subject to the same 2 penalties as provided in Code section 459.603. A habitual 3 violator of the provisions of division V of the bill shall be 4 subject to the same penalties and restrictions as provided in 5 Code sections 459.604 and 459.605.

NEW SECTION . 476.52A Definitions. 4 As used in this subchapter unless the context otherwise 5 requires: 6 1. âAlternate energy production facilityâ means the same as 7 defined in section 476.42. 8 2. âEnergy storageâ means any system, equipment, facility, 9 or technology that is capable of absorbing energy, storing the 10 energy for a period of time, and dispatching the energy through 11 one of the following manners: 12 a. Using mechanical, electrochemical, thermal, 13 electrolysis, or other processes to convert and store electric 14 energy that was generated at an earlier time for use at a later 15 time. 16 b. Using mechanical, electrochemical, biochemical, or 17 thermal processes to convert and store energy generated 18 from mechanical processes that would otherwise be wasted for 19 delivery at a later time. 20 c. Storing energy in an electric, thermal, or gaseous 21 state for direct use for heating or cooling at a later time 22 in a manner that avoids the need to use electricity or other 23 fuel sources at that later time, such as a grid-enabled water 24 heater. 25 3. âNuclear reactorâ means an apparatus designed to produce 26 electrical or heat energy through sustained nuclear fission in 27 a self-supporting chain reaction. 28 4. âRepoweringâ means either the complete dismantling and 29 replacement of generation equipment at an existing project 30 site, or the installation of new parts and equipment to an 31 existing alternate energy production facility in order to 32 increase energy production, reduce load, increase service 33 capacity, improve project reliability, or extend the useful 34 life of the facility. 35 -1- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 1/ 53 H.F. 834 Sec. 2. Section 476.53, subsection 1, Code 2025, is amended 1 to read as follows: 2 1. It is the intent of the general assembly to attract 3 the development of electric power generating , energy storage, 4 and transmission facilities within the state in sufficient 5 quantity to ensure reliable electric service to Iowa consumers , 6 ensure an adequate base load, and provide economic benefits to 7 the state. Ensuring reliable electric service and providing 8 economic benefits may require public utilities to consider 9 diverse electric power generating technologies and energy 10 storage technologies, including alternate energy production 11 facilities, nuclear reactors, and energy storage facilities. 12 It is also the intent of the general assembly to encourage 13 rate-regulated public utilities to consider altering existing 14 electric power generating facilities, where when reasonable, 15 to manage carbon emission intensity in order to facilitate the 16 transition to a carbon-constrained environment. It is also the 17 intent of the general assembly to encourage the development 18 of nuclear electric power generation within the state using 19 nuclear reactors and to use nuclear power to meet local and 20 regional electric needs. 21 Sec. 3. Section 476.53, subsection 3, paragraphs a, b, c, 22 and d, Code 2025, are amended to read as follows: 23 a. The commission shall specify in advance, by order issued 24 after conduct a contested case proceeding , the ratemaking 25 principles that will apply when the costs of the electric power 26 generating facility or alternate energy production facility are 27 included in regulated electric rates whenever a rate-regulated 28 public utility does seeks ratemaking principles for any of the 29 following: 30 (1) (a) Files an application pursuant to section 476A.3 31 to construct The costs of constructing in Iowa a baseload an 32 electric power generating facility with a nameplate generating 33 capacity equal to or greater than three hundred forty megawatts 34 or a combined-cycle electric power generating facility , or an 35 -2- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 2/ 53 H.F. 834 alternate energy production facility as defined in section 1 476.42 , or an energy storage facility, or the construction 2 costs to significantly alter an existing electric power 3 generating facility , alternate energy production facility, or 4 energy storage facility . For purposes of this subparagraph, 5 a significant alteration of an existing generating facility , 6 alternate energy production facility, or energy storage 7 facility must, in order to qualify for establishment of 8 ratemaking principles, fall into one of the following 9 categories: 10 (i) Conversion of a coal fueled an electric power generating 11 facility into a gas fueled to an alternate fuel type for the 12 electric power generating facility. 13 (ii) Addition of carbon capture and storage facilities at a 14 coal fueled to an existing electric power generating facility. 15 (iii) Addition of gas fueled capability to a coal fueled 16 facility, in order to convert the facility to one that will 17 rely primarily on gas for future generation facilities to 18 capture exhaust heat and thereby generate additional electric 19 power at an existing electric power generating facility . 20 (iv) Addition of a biomass fueled capability to a coal 21 fueled facility. 22 (v) (iv) Repowering of an alternate energy production 23 facility. For purposes of this subparagraph subdivision, 24 ârepoweringâ shall mean either the complete dismantling and 25 replacement of generation equipment at an existing project 26 site, or the installation of new parts and equipment to an 27 existing alternate energy production facility in order to 28 increase energy production, reduce load, increase service 29 capacity, improve project reliability, or extend the useful 30 life of the facility. 31 (v) Addition of energy storage at an existing electric power 32 generating facility, alternate energy production facility, or 33 energy storage facility. 34 (b) With respect to a significant alteration of an 35 -3- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 3/ 53 H.F. 834 existing generating facility, an original facility shall 1 not be required to be either a baseload or a combined-cycle 2 facility. Only only the incremental investment undertaken 3 by a utility under subparagraph division (a), subparagraph 4 subdivision (i), (ii), or (iii), or (iv) shall be eligible 5 to apply the ratemaking principles established by the order 6 issued pursuant to paragraph âeâ . Facilities for which advanced 7 advance ratemaking principles are obtained pursuant to this 8 section shall not be subject to a subsequent commission review 9 pursuant to section 476.6, subsection 19 , to the extent that 10 the investment has been considered by the commission under 11 this section . To the extent an eligible utility has been 12 authorized to make capital investments subject to section 13 476.6, subsection 19 , such investments shall not be eligible 14 for ratemaking principles pursuant to this section . 15 (2) Leases or owns When leased or owned in Iowa, in whole or 16 in part, a new baseload electric power generating facility with 17 a nameplate generating capacity equal to or greater than three 18 hundred forty megawatts or a combined-cycle electric power 19 generating , a new energy storage facility, or a new alternate 20 energy production facility as defined in section 476.42 . 21 b. If the commission finds that the utilityâs application 22 meets the requirements of paragraph âcâ , the commission shall 23 specify by order issued after the contested case proceeding 24 the ratemaking principles that will apply when the costs of 25 the electric power generating facility or alternate energy 26 production facility are included in regulated electric rates. 27 In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the 28 commission shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking 29 principles or traditional cost recovery mechanisms. Among the 30 principles and mechanisms the commission may consider, the 31 commission has the authority to approve ratemaking principles 32 proposed by a rate-regulated public utility that provide for 33 reasonable restrictions upon the ability of the public utility 34 to seek a general increase in electric rates under section 35 -4- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 4/ 53 H.F. 834 476.6 for at least three years after the generating facility 1 begins providing service to Iowa customers. 2 c. In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the 3 commission shall make the following findings: 4 (1) The rate-regulated public utility has in effect a 5 commission-approved energy efficiency plan as required under 6 section 476.6, subsection 15 . 7 (2) The rate-regulated public utility has demonstrated to 8 the commission that the public utility has considered other 9 sources for long-term electric supply and that the facility or 10 lease is reasonable when compared to other feasible alternative 11 sources of supply. The rate-regulated public utility shall 12 provide support of reasonability with an electric utility 13 resource plan pursuant to section 476.53C that has been updated 14 no more than twenty-four months prior to the filing of the 15 public utilityâs application. 16 d. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined 17 in a contested case proceeding , which proceeding required by 18 paragraph âaâ may be combined with the proceeding for issuance 19 of a certificate conducted pursuant to chapter 476A . 20 Sec. 4. NEW SECTION . 476.53B Commission authority and 21 proceedings. 22 The commission shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A 23 to provide for the completion of proceedings under section 24 476.53 within ten months after the date of the filing of an 25 application under section 476.53, subsection 3. The rules 26 shall include reasonable time limitations for the submission or 27 completion of comments and testimony, and exhibits, briefs, and 28 hearings, and may provide for the granting of additional time 29 upon the request of a party to the proceeding for good cause 30 shown. 31 Sec. 5. NEW SECTION . 476.53C Electric utility resource 32 planning. 33 1. An electric utility required to be rate-regulated by the 34 commission shall file a resource plan at least once every five 35 -5- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 5/ 53 H.F. 834 years. A resource plan shall consider all reasonable resources 1 proposed by the utility for meeting the probable future demand 2 for energy, including supply resources and conservation and 3 management of demand. For conservation and management of 4 demand, an electric utilityâs resource plan shall include 5 programs approved in the electric utilityâs most recent energy 6 efficiency plan approved by the commission under section 476.6, 7 subsection 15. The objectives of a resource plan include but 8 are not limited to adequate, cost-effective, and reliable 9 energy service considering costs, fuel diversity, and probable 10 future demand for energy. A resource plan shall not require a 11 specific outcome or specific investment decisions. A resource 12 plan shall reflect the circumstances and management judgment 13 of an electric utility. This section does not restrict an 14 electric utility from making planning decisions based on future 15 resource needs subject to the ratemaking oversight of the 16 commission. 17 2. The commission shall review a resource plan. Within 18 ninety days of filing the final resource plan, the commission 19 shall issue an order acknowledging it has received the plan. 20 In the order acknowledging receipt, the commission may provide 21 recommendations to an electric utility regarding any additional 22 analyses or actions that the electric utility should consider 23 completing in its next resource plan. 24 3. The commission shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 25 17A regarding the timeline and stakeholder process to review 26 and provide comments on the resource plan. The stakeholder 27 process shall include the electric utility organizing and 28 facilitating a stakeholder conference for the resource plan. 29 The stakeholder conference shall include representatives of the 30 commission, the consumer advocate, and the electric utilityâs 31 customers. The electric utility shall make a good faith effort 32 to inform and consider input from the commission, the consumer 33 advocate, and stakeholders. 34 DIVISION II 35 -6- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 6/ 53 H.F. 834 TARIFFS FOR PUBLIC UTILITY INNOVATION PROGRAMS 1 Sec. 6. Section 476.6, Code 2025, is amended by adding the 2 following new subsection: 3 NEW SUBSECTION . 22. Innovative utility programs. 4 a. It is the intent of the general assembly to encourage 5 public utilities to pursue innovation in pricing and programs 6 to meet the dynamic needs of current and prospective customers, 7 enable price-responsive solutions, and to provide economic, 8 environmental, employment, and other benefits to the state. 9 It is also the intent of the general assembly that these 10 new endeavors shall not negatively impact nonparticipating 11 customers. Therefore, the general assembly declares that 12 innovative utility programs are essential to further the 13 attraction and retention of customers to benefit the stateâs 14 economy and to support economical and sustainable energy 15 production. 16 b. (1) A tariff authorized under this subsection shall 17 comply with all of the following conditions: 18 (a) A program created under the tariff shall be available to 19 interested energy customers and customer participation shall 20 be optional. 21 (b) A tariff shall define the eligible customer groups. 22 (c) An eligible customer group shall not exclude directly 23 competing customers in the same customer service territory. 24 For purposes of this subparagraph, âdirectly competing 25 customersâ means customers that make the same end product or 26 offer the same service for the same general group of customers, 27 and excludes customers that only produce component parts of the 28 same end product. 29 (d) Participating customers shall bear all program costs. 30 Program costs include direct costs associated with the 31 construction, operation, maintenance, and interconnection of 32 facilities, including new transmission infrastructure directly 33 arising from the tariff program and costs related to the 34 implementation of tariff programs. Participants in a tariff 35 -7- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 7/ 53 H.F. 834 approved pursuant to this section shall participate in future 1 indirect costs allocated to customers of that utility without 2 regard for the existence of a tariff approved pursuant to this 3 section. 4 (e) A tariff shall not alter the existing base rates or 5 charges of the public utility. Refund, credit, or waiver of 6 existing base rates or charges offered as part of the program 7 shall not be considered an alteration of existing base rates 8 or charges. 9 (f) The program created under the tariff shall not 10 negatively impact nonparticipating customers. Additional 11 costs incurred by nonparticipating customers due to costs 12 arising from the tariff, tariff participants no longer sharing 13 in customer class costs, or decreased customer benefit from 14 existing infrastructure shall be considered negative impacts. 15 (2) A tariff authorized under this subsection may include 16 any of the following: 17 (a) Recovery of costs associated with program-specific 18 services or facilities, including but not limited to energy 19 storage, renewable hydrogen, transmission, electric generating 20 facilities, electric distribution facilities, renewable natural 21 gas generation facilities, renewable natural gas distribution 22 facilities, utility-assisted hourly prices, or liquefied 23 natural gas facilities, or administrative and other overhead 24 costs relating to the same. 25 (b) A negotiated rate of return, for new or existing 26 facilities or services provided by the electric utility that 27 are serving the program created under the tariff, applicable to 28 the program for its duration. The use of existing facilities 29 would require reconciliation of impact to existing customers 30 and would no longer be subject to previously approved advance 31 ratemaking principles. In the event that the tariff or its 32 eligible customer class cease to exist, no charges shall be 33 imposed on or costs recovered from existing customers unless 34 approved in a general rate case. A utility may seek to 35 -8- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 8/ 53 H.F. 834 demonstrate the prudence, necessity, and use and usefulness 1 of program-specific facilities or services as defined in 2 subparagraph division (a) and recovery of costs for the same in 3 a general rate proceeding, without any presumption regarding 4 approval of such request. 5 (c) Application of the program to readily identifiable 6 customer usage patterns, customer characteristics, or output 7 of specified facilities. 8 (d) Assignment of program benefits, including nonmonetary 9 benefits that may derive from dynamically balancing supply and 10 demand, providing ancillary services, or the production of 11 renewable energy attributes. 12 (e) Refund, credit, or waive the base rate or charge for 13 the replaced service when the program created under the tariff 14 replaces a service for which the public utility collects an 15 existing base rate or charge. A participating customer shall 16 pay the costs of remaining services received from the public 17 utility unless those costs are refunded, credited, or waived 18 under the program created by the tariff. 19 (3) If a utility can demonstrate to the commission that 20 a proposed tariff generates excess revenue for the utility 21 as compared to total revenue without the tariff, such excess 22 revenue may be retained by the utility. 23 c. (1) A public utilityâs participation under this 24 subsection is not mandatory. A public utility that elects to 25 propose a tariff or tariff amendment under this subsection 26 shall file an application for approval with the commission. 27 The application shall include an identification of costs and 28 benefits related to the program for the commissionâs review of 29 the conditions specified in paragraph âbâ , subparagraph (1). 30 (2) Within thirty days, the commission shall approve, deny, 31 or docket for further review an application for a tariff or 32 amended tariff submitted pursuant to this subsection. If the 33 application is docketed for further review, the commission 34 shall render a decision within ninety days from the date of 35 -9- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 9/ 53 H.F. 834 application filing unless an objection has been filed with the 1 commission. If the application proposes to amend a tariff 2 previously approved under this subsection, the commission shall 3 not reconsider existing programs previously approved under the 4 tariff unless proposed as part of the amendment. All further 5 review shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to 6 chapter 17A. 7 (3) If the application proposes to amend a tariff previously 8 approved under this subsection as described in paragraph âbâ , 9 subparagraph (2), the commission shall act on the application 10 as described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, but shall 11 not reconsider existing programs previously approved under the 12 tariff unless proposed as part of the amendment. 13 (4) In the exercise of its authority under this subsection, 14 the commission shall not: 15 (a) Limit the number of applications a public utility may 16 file pursuant to this subsection. 17 (b) Deny a tariff because a public utility is subject to an 18 alternative regulatory mechanism, nor require a public utility 19 subject to an alternative regulatory mechanism to record the 20 revenues and costs associated with the program inconsistent 21 with the federal energy regulatory commissionâs uniform system 22 of accounts; provided, however, that this provision shall not 23 prohibit the utilities commission from denying a tariff if the 24 proposed tariff would result in detrimental treatment of other 25 customers, or require adjustment to the calculation of the 26 alternative regulatory mechanism to reflect the impact of an 27 approved tariff. 28 (c) Condition its approval on the public utility changing 29 its proposal if the public utility has not agreed to such 30 changes. This subparagraph division shall not be interpreted 31 to prevent the commission from identifying changes to the 32 proposal that might result in approval. 33 (5) Tariffs and programs approved pursuant to this 34 subsection shall be rebuttably presumed just and reasonable in 35 -10- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 10/ 53 H.F. 834 any subsequent general rate case proceeding. 1 d. The commission shall not condition approval or denial of 2 a tariff on final adoption of rules by the commission. 3 e. The commission shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A 4 to implement this subsection. 5 Sec. 7. APPLICABILITY. This division of this Act applies 6 to a public utility filing an application with the utilities 7 commission for review of a tariff on or after the effective 8 date of this division of this Act. 9 DIVISION III 10 LAND RESTORATION ââ ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION LINES APPROVED BY 11 FEDERALLY REGISTERED PLANNING AUTHORITY TRANSMISSION PLANS 12 Sec. 8. Section 478.16, Code 2025, is amended to read as 13 follows: 14 478.16 Electric transmission lines ââ federally registered 15 planning authority transmission plans. 16 1. Development and investment in high-voltage transmission 17 is urgently needed to ensure the reliable, adequate, secure, 18 and stable delivery of electricity to consumers. To ensure 19 reliable electric service to the people of Iowa as a matter 20 of public policy, it is the intent of the general assembly 21 to express a preference for further investment in Iowa 22 transmission infrastructure by electric transmission owners who 23 have already dedicated significant resources to develop the 24 infrastructure on which Iowans rely and who are better able to 25 provide reliable electric service to local electric utilities 26 and retail customers in Iowa. 27 1. 2.

The Code editor shall designate sections 459C.501 25 through 459C.502, as enacted by this division of this Act, as 26 a new subchapter within chapter 459C, entitled âEnforcement 27 Provisionsâ. 28 EXPLANATION 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 30 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 31 This bill relates to rate-regulated utilities by modifying 32 provisions relating to electric power generation, energy 33 storage, and transmission facility ratemaking principles, 34 creating tariffs for public utility innovation programs, 35 -35- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 35/ 53 H.F. 834 implementing land restoration standards, and modifying the 1 energy infrastructure revolving loan program. 2 Division I of the bill modifies intent language to reflect 3 an intent to attract energy storage and develop nuclear power 4 generation for consumers in the state. 5 Division I of the bill alters ratemaking principle 6 processes and modifies when a rate-regulated public utility 7 may seek ratemaking principles. In addition to electric 8 power generating facilities and alternate energy production 9 facilities, the utilities commission (commission) may specify 10 the ratemaking principles applying to an energy storage 11 facility. 12 Division I of the bill provides that a rate-regulated 13 public utility may seek ratemaking principles from the 14 commission when there are construction-related costs of an 15 electric power generating facility with a nameplate generating 16 capacity equal to or greater than 40 megawatts, an alternate 17 energy production facility, or an energy storage facility, 18 or significant alterations to an existing electric power 19 generating facility, alternate energy production facility, 20 or energy storage facility. Current law generally provides 21 that when a rate-regulated public utility files an application 22 to construct a baseload electric power generating facility 23 with a nameplate generating capacity equal to or greater than 24 300 megawatts or a combined-cycle electric power generating 25 facility or an alternate energy production facility, or to 26 significantly alter an existing generating facility or a new 27 alternate energy production facility, the commission shall 28 specify in advance the ratemaking principles that will apply. 29 Division I of the bill modifies the requirements for a 30 significant alteration of an existing generating facility 31 to qualify for the establishment of ratemaking principles. 32 Division I of the bill provides that to qualify for ratemaking 33 principles, the significant alteration can convert an electric 34 power generating facility to an alternate fuel type, add 35 -36- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 36/ 53 H.F. 834 carbon capture and carbon storage to an electric power 1 generating facility, add a facility to capture exhaust heat to 2 an electric power generating facility, repower an alternate 3 energy production facility, or add energy storage to an 4 existing electric power generating facility, alternate energy 5 production facility, or energy storage facility. Current 6 law provides that to qualify for ratemaking principles, the 7 significant alteration can convert a coal-fueled facility into 8 a gas-fueled facility, add carbon capture and carbon storage 9 to a coal-fueled facility, add gas-fueled capability to a 10 coal-fueled facility, add a biomass-fueled capability to a 11 coal-fueled facility, or repower an alternate energy production 12 facility. 13 Division I of the bill provides that a utility investment to 14 convert an electric power generating facility to a different 15 fuel type, add carbon capture and carbon storage to an electric 16 power generating facility, or add a fuel type to an electric 17 power generating facility shall be eligible to apply the 18 ratemaking principles established by an order issued prior to 19 construction or lease of a facility. 20 Division I of the bill provides that a rate-regulated 21 public utility may seek ratemaking principles for leasing 22 or owning a new electric power generating facility with a 23 nameplate generating capacity equal to or greater than 40 24 megawatts, a new energy storage facility, or a new alternate 25 energy production facility. Current law provides that 26 a rate-regulated public utility leasing or owning a new 27 baseload electric power generating facility with a nameplate 28 generating capacity equal to or greater than 300 megawatts, 29 a combined-cycle electric power generating facility, or a 30 new alternate energy production facility may seek ratemaking 31 principles. 32 Division I of the bill requires the commission to issue an 33 order after the contested case proceeding that the ratemaking 34 principles will apply when the costs of the electric power 35 -37- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 37/ 53 H.F. 834 generating facility or alternate energy production facility 1 are included in regulated electric rates once the commission 2 finds that the rate-regulated public utilityâs application for 3 ratemaking principles meets all the commissionâs requirements. 4 Division I of the bill requires a rate-regulated public 5 utility seeking ratemaking principles to provide support of 6 reasonability with an electric utility resource plan that has 7 been updated within 24 months of filing the application. 8 Division I of the bill requires the commission to adopt 9 rules for proceedings to conclude 10 months after a petition is 10 filed. 11 Division I of the bill requires rate-regulated electric 12 utilities to file a resource plan at least once every five 13 years. The resource plan must consider all reasonable 14 resources by the utility for meeting the probable future demand 15 for energy, including supply resources and conservation and 16 management of demand. For conservation and management of 17 demand, the resource plan shall include programs approved in 18 the electric utilityâs most recently approved energy efficiency 19 plan. The objectives of the resource plan include but are 20 not limited to adequate, cost-effective, and reliable energy 21 service considering costs, fuel diversity, and probable future 22 demand for energy, and should reflect the circumstances and 23 management judgment of the electric utility. The resource 24 plan does not require specific outcomes or specific investment 25 decisions. 26 Division I of the bill directs the commission to issue an 27 order within 90 days of the resource plan acknowledging receipt 28 of the plan. This order may provide recommendations to an 29 electric utility regarding any additional analyses or actions 30 that the electric utility should consider completing in its 31 next resource plan. 32 Division I of the bill directs the commission to adopt rules 33 regarding the timeline and stakeholder process to review and 34 provide comments on the resource plan. The stakeholder process 35 -38- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 38/ 53 H.F. 834 shall include the electric utility organizing and facilitating 1 a stakeholder conference with representatives of the 2 commission, the consumer advocate, and the electric utilityâs 3 customers. Division I of the bill directs the electric utility 4 to make a good faith effort to inform and consider input from 5 the commission, the consumer advocate, and stakeholders. 6 Division II of the bill provides that it is the intent of 7 the general assembly to encourage public utility innovation 8 in pricing and programs, and that the new innovations not 9 negatively impact nonparticipating customers. Division II 10 of the bill additionally provides that it is the intent of 11 the general assembly to attract and retain customers for the 12 benefit of the stateâs economy, support of economical energy 13 production, and support of sustainable energy production. 14 Division II of the bill authorizes a tariff program. 15 Division II of the bill provides that a tariff shall comply 16 with several provisions. The tariff shall be optional for 17 customers, define eligible customer groups, and assess 18 program costs to participating customers. Program costs 19 shall include specified direct costs arising from the tariff 20 program and costs related to the implementation of tariff 21 programs. Participants of a tariff program shall participate 22 in future indirect costs allocated to customers of that 23 utility without regard for the existence of an approved tariff. 24 The tariff shall not allow for an eligible customer group 25 excluding directly competing customers in the same customer 26 service territory, alter existing base rate or charges of 27 the public utility, or negatively impact nonparticipating 28 customers. Negative impacts include additional costs incurred 29 by nonparticipating customers due to costs arising from the 30 tariff, tariff participants no longer sharing in customer 31 class costs, or decreased customer benefit from existing 32 infrastructure. 33 Division II of the bill explains that a tariff may include 34 provisions relating to recovery of costs, rate of return, 35 -39- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 39/ 53 H.F. 834 application of the program to other specified patterns, program 1 benefits, and refunds, credits, or waivers when the program 2 replaces an existing service, or recovery of costs associated 3 with existing facilities. A participating program customer 4 shall pay the costs of the services received from the public 5 utility unless the costs are refunded, credited, or waived 6 under the program. Division II of the bill provides that 7 if the program or eligible customer group cease to exist and 8 the public utility seeks recovery of the program-specific 9 facilities through a general rate case proceeding, the public 10 utility shall demonstrate the reasonableness and prudence 11 without any presumption regarding approval of such request. A 12 public utility shall be allowed to recover program-specific 13 facilities through general rate case proceedings. If the 14 utility can demonstrate to the commission that the proposed 15 tariff generates excess revenue for the utility as compared to 16 total revenue without the tariff, the excess revenue may be 17 retained by the utility. 18 Division II of the bill provides for tariff application 19 and approval. A public utilityâs authority is not mandatory 20 regarding tariffs. Division II of the bill provides that an 21 application for a tariff or amendment to a tariff shall be 22 filed with the commission. The commission shall approve, deny, 23 or docket for further review an application within 30 days. 24 If the commission dockets the application for further review, 25 the commission shall render a decision within 90 days from the 26 date of application filing, unless an objection is filed. The 27 commission shall not reconsider existing programs previously 28 approved under the tariff during a review of an application 29 for an amendment to a tariff unless the review of a program is 30 proposed as part of the amendment. 31 Division II of the bill prohibits the commission from 32 certain actions. Division II of the bill provides that 33 the commission shall not limit the number of applications a 34 public utility may file, deny, or condition the approval of a 35 -40- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 40/ 53 H.F. 834 tariff because a public utility is subject to an alternative 1 regulatory mechanism, or require a public utility subject to an 2 alternative regulatory mechanism to record revenues and costs 3 in an inconsistent manner with specified federal standards, 4 provided that the proposed tariff would not result in 5 detrimental treatment of other customers or require adjustment 6 to the calculation of the alternative regulatory mechanism to 7 reflect the impact of an approved tariff. Division II of the 8 bill prohibits the commission from conditioning approval of a 9 tariff on the requirement that the public utility change the 10 proposal to unagreed-upon terms, but this prohibition does not 11 prevent the commission from identifying changes to the proposal 12 that might result in approval. 13 Division II of the bill provides that tariffs and programs 14 approved pursuant to division II of the bill shall be 15 rebuttably presumed to be just and reasonable in general rate 16 case proceedings. Division II of the bill prohibits the 17 commission from conditioning approval or denial of a tariff 18 on the final adoption of rules and requires the commission to 19 adopt rules related to division II of the bill. 20 Division II of the bill applies to a public utility filing an 21 application with the commission for review of a tariff on or 22 after the effective date of division II of the bill. 23 Division III of the bill relates to electric transmission 24 lines and electric transmission owners. Division III of the 25 bill expounds the legislative purpose of Code section 478.16, 26 identifying Iowa consumersâ urgent need for development and 27 investment in high-voltage transmission. Division III of the 28 bill provides that an incumbent electric transmission owner may 29 be formed, located, or headquartered in any state as long as 30 the electric transmission line is located in Iowa. 31 Division III of the bill defines an âincumbent electric 32 transmission ownerâ as an individual or entity who, as of July 33 1, 2024, owns and maintains an electric transmission line 34 in this state that is required for rate-regulated electric 35 -41- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 41/ 53 H.F. 834 utilities, municipal electric utilities, and rural electric 1 cooperatives in the state to provide electric service to the 2 public for compensation. 3 Under division III of the bill, an incumbent electric 4 transmission facility owner has the right to construct, own, 5 and maintain an electric transmission line that directly 6 connects to the electric transmission facility. If a proposed 7 transmission line would directly connect to facilities owned 8 by two or more facility owners, each owner has the right to 9 construct, own, and maintain the electric transmission line 10 individually and equally. 11 Division III of the bill requires an incumbent electric 12 transmission owner exercising its right to construct, own, 13 and maintain an electric transmission line to offer public 14 power utilities an opportunity to jointly own a portion of the 15 electric transmission line. The offered amount must be at 16 least the amount of the public power utilityâs electric load 17 divided by the total electric load in the applicable incumbent 18 electric transmission ownerâs pricing zone. Division III of 19 the bill does not prohibit the entities from agreeing to joint 20 ownership in a different amount. Additionally, division III of 21 the bill allows the public power utility to transfer or assign 22 its joint ownership rights to another public power utility 23 or group of public power utilities with the consent of the 24 incumbent electric transmission owner. 25 Division III of the bill allows an incumbent electric 26 transmission owner exercising its right to construct, own, 27 and maintain an electric transmission line to contract with 28 another electric transmission owner or electric public utility 29 to jointly own a portion of the electric transmission line. 30 Division III of the bill requires the incumbent electric 31 transmission owner or owners with approved electric 32 transmission lines not subject to right of first refusal 33 in a federally registered planning authority transmission 34 plan to give notice to the commission whether the owner or 35 -42- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 42/ 53 H.F. 834 owners intend to construct, own, and maintain the electric 1 transmission line. The notice shall be given within the later 2 of 90 days of approval for construction or 90 days after 3 enactment of division III of the bill. The commission may 4 determine whether another person may construct the electric 5 transmission line if the incumbent electric transmission owner 6 or owners give notice declining to construct or do not give 7 timely notice. 8 Division III of the bill requires incumbent electric 9 transmission owners to provide documentation to the commission 10 that shows utilization of competitively bid construction 11 contracts that meet all necessary technical, commercial, and 12 other specifications required for compliant construction. 13 Division III of the bill allows the consumer advocate free 14 access to all documents, reports, and information submitted to 15 the commission regarding cost accountability measures for the 16 construction of electric transmission lines. These documents, 17 reports, and information may be used by the consumer advocate 18 for any purpose within the scope of the consumer advocateâs 19 duties. These provisions do not create a private cause of 20 action or complaint. 21 Division III of the bill directs the commission to adopt 22 rules to implement the land restoration requirements after 23 initial construction of an electric transmission line as set 24 forth in division III of the bill. 25 Division III of the bill requires incumbent electric 26 transmission owners to repair drain tiles damaged during 27 construction as soon as practicable and to complete permanent 28 repairs as soon as practicable after initial construction. The 29 permanent repairs must be of the same quality, size, and flow 30 capacity of the original drain tile. 31 Division III of the bill requires incumbent electric 32 transmission owners to remove all nonnative rocks larger 33 than three inches in diameter from the easement area. The 34 disposal of rock that cannot be used as backfill must be done 35 -43- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 43/ 53 H.F. 834 at a location and in a manner agreed to between the incumbent 1 electric transmission owner and the landowner. 2 Division III of the bill requires the incumbent electric 3 transmission owner to till agricultural land affected by 4 construction, including right-of-way access points or roads, 5 after electric transmission line construction activities are 6 completed on the affected property. The land must be tilled 7 at least 18 inches deep in land used for crop production and 12 8 inches deep in all other land, unless otherwise agreed to by 9 the landowner. 10 Division III of the bill requires the incumbent electric 11 transmission owner to restore soil conservation practices 12 and structures damaged during construction to their previous 13 state, compact the soil used to repair embankments intended to 14 retain water, and reestablish any vegetation disturbed during 15 construction, including cover crops. 16 Division III of the bill requires the incumbent electric 17 transmission owner to reseed the agricultural land, excluding 18 row crops and small grain production, following compaction 19 of the land. Seeding for cover crops may be delayed if 20 construction is completed too late in the year and is not 21 required if the land will be tilled the following year. When 22 the season is not suitable for the seeding of cover crops, the 23 landowner may request ground cover to prevent soil erosion. 24 Division III of the bill requires the incumbent electric 25 transmission owner to remove all field entrances and temporary 26 roads used during construction and to restore the areas to 27 their previous state following the completion of the initial 28 construction. 29 Division III of the bill requires the incumbent electric 30 transmission owner to use good practices when constructing in 31 wet conditions and to grade and till any rutted land in order 32 to restore the land to its original condition to the extent 33 practicable. Additionally, division III of the bill allows 34 the landowner to repair damage caused by construction in wet 35 -44- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 44/ 53 H.F. 834 conditions. The incumbent electric transmission owner shall 1 then reimburse the landowner for reasonable costs of repair. 2 Division III of the bill requires an electric transmission 3 owner to utilize mudflats, mats, or other measures to minimize 4 soil disturbance when using heavy equipment in wetlands. 5 Division III of the bill requires the incumbent electric 6 transmission owner to provide contact information to all 7 persons affected by the construction of each transmission line. 8 Division III of the bill allows the commission to appoint an 9 inspector to determine compliance with restoration standards 10 in the event the incumbent electric transmission owner and the 11 landowner dispute over potential violations. The cost of the 12 inspection shall be paid by the incumbent electric transmission 13 owner. If the inspector determines there have been violations 14 of the restoration standards, the commission will provide oral 15 and written notice to the incumbent electric transmission 16 owner. The commission will order corrective actions be taken 17 to comply with the standards. The costs of the corrective 18 actions will be borne by the electric transmission owner. 19 Division III of the bill allows the commission to issue an 20 order requiring corrective action and impose civil penalties if 21 the incumbent electric transmission owner or its contractor do 22 not comply with the required standards. 23 Division III of the bill requires the commission to instruct 24 the inspectors on the statutes, rules, and responsibilities 25 regarding restoration standards. 26 Division III of the bill requires petitioners for a 27 franchise for electric transmission construction to file a land 28 restoration plan outlining how the construction will conform 29 to the required standards. The restoration plan will also be 30 provided to all property owners affected by the construction. 31 Division III of the bill allows alternative provisions in 32 independent agreements with landowners regarding protecting or 33 restoring property as long as these provisions are in writing 34 and are provided to the commission. 35 -45- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 45/ 53 H.F. 834 Division III of the bill allows electric transmission 1 owners to propose alternate methods of land restoration to the 2 commission. The commission, by waiver, may allow variations 3 to the land restoration requirements if the proposed alternate 4 methods would restore the land to a condition as good or better 5 than those required by division III of the bill. 6 Division III of the bill allows the commission to waive the 7 preparation of a separate land restoration plan, in whole or in 8 part, if the incumbent electric transmission owner satisfies 9 the requirements through similar agreement with other agencies 10 in the state. The relevant agreements must be filed with the 11 commission. 12 Division III of the bill does not limit, expand, or otherwise 13 modify the rights of access and obligations for damages set 14 forth in Code section 478.17. 15 Division III of the bill takes effect upon enactment. 16 Division III of the bill applies retroactively to an 17 electric transmission line included in a federally registered 18 planning authority long-term transmission plan approved on 19 or after July 1, 2020, with the exception of the provisions 20 requiring incumbent electric transmission owners to offer 21 public power utilities the option to jointly own qualifying 22 electric transmission lines. For this exception, division III 23 of the bill applies retroactively to July 1, 2024. 24 Division IV of the bill relates to the energy infrastructure 25 revolving loan program, which is renamed as the âenergy and 26 water infrastructure revolving loan programâ. 27 Under current law, the energy infrastructure revolving loan 28 fund (fund) and program are administered by the Iowa energy 29 center (center). Division IV of the bill instead places 30 the administrative duty with the Iowa economic development 31 authority (IEDA) and renames the fund the âenergy and water 32 infrastructure revolving loan fundâ. 33 Division IV of the bill adds financial assistance for the 34 development and construction of water infrastructure that 35 -46- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 46/ 53 H.F. 834 supports economic development to the fundâs approved uses, 1 including drinking water treatment systems and wastewater 2 treatment systems. 3 Division IV of the bill expands the entities eligible for 4 assistance under the fund to include a county or city. 5 Under current law, the approval of the centerâs governing 6 board is required before IEDA can determine the amount and 7 the terms of all financial assistance awarded to an eligible 8 borrower and all agreements and administrative authority are 9 vested in the centerâs governing board. Division IV of the 10 bill removes the approval requirement by the center and its 11 authority regarding agreements. 12 Division IV of the bill adds that to be eligible for 13 a financial assistance award under the energy and water 14 infrastructure revolving loan program, an eligible borrower 15 must demonstrate that the proposed project will attract and 16 encourage the location of new industrial enterprise or the 17 expansion of existing industrial enterprise. Division IV 18 of the bill states that IEDA shall determine the amount and 19 the terms of all financial assistance awarded to an eligible 20 borrower under the program and that all agreements and 21 administrative authority shall be vested in IEDA. Division 22 IV of the bill provides that IEDA may adopt rules for the 23 implementation of this program. 24 Division IV of the bill grants IEDA the ability to authorize 25 the transfer of up to $633,000 annually to Iowa state 26 university of science and technology to be used for providing 27 financial assistance to the state load forecasting center. 28 Division V of the bill relates to anaerobic digester 29 systems. Division V of the bill states its purpose is to 30 provide requirements relating to the construction, including 31 the expansion, and operation of anaerobic digester systems and 32 the control of digestate. Division V of the bill directs the 33 environmental protection commission to make rules for this 34 stated purpose. Division V of the bill states that if the 35 -47- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 47/ 53 H.F. 834 provisions of new Code chapter 459C conflict with Code chapter 1 459, 459A, or 459B, the provisions of Code chapter 459C shall 2 prevail. 3 Division V of the bill directs the department of natural 4 resources (DNR) to approve applications for permits for 5 construction, including expansion, of anaerobic digester 6 systems based on procedures required in division V of the 7 bill and rules created by DNR pursuant to division V of the 8 bill. Division V of the bill prohibits the construction of 9 an anaerobic digester system, regardless of size, until the 10 construction permit has been approved. The applicant must 11 also submit a $250 permit application fee, a written plan for 12 disposal of the digestate, and a written operation plan for an 13 anaerobic digester system. 14 Division V of the bill requires an anaerobic digester 15 system to accept only manure unless DNR otherwise approves the 16 inclusion of organic by-product, food product, or food for 17 human consumption. Nonmanure materials shall not compose more 18 than 10 percent of the total material added to an anaerobic 19 digester system. 20 Division V of the bill requires a daily record of materials 21 added to an anaerobic digester system to be kept and maintained 22 at the facility and grants DNR the authority for additional 23 testing or monitoring of the materials added to an anaerobic 24 digester system and the digestate. 25 Division V of the bill prohibits medical wastes, including 26 expired or unused antibiotics, petroleum products not designed 27 for use in manure storage facilities, pesticides, paints, 28 solvents, hazardous materials, municipal or sanitary waste 29 or sludge, industrial wastewater, contaminated feedstock, 30 slaughterhouse wastes, and residues from processing of food 31 materials that have not been deemed acceptable for human 32 consumption from being processed in an anaerobic digester 33 system. 34 Division V of the bill directs DNR to adopt rules to 35 -48- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 48/ 53 H.F. 834 establish construction design standards for formed manure 1 storage structures that are part of an anaerobic digester 2 system. Division V of the bill requires construction design 3 standards to be based upon uniform standards and provides 4 construction design standards for concrete. 5 Division V of the bill prohibits the construction of 6 unformed manure storage structures on karst terrain, but allows 7 the construction of a formed manure storage structure on 8 karst terrain or an area that drains into a known sinkhole if 9 upgraded construction design standards necessary to ensure that 10 the structure does not pollute groundwater sources are used. 11 Division V of the bill provides separation distance 12 requirements between an anaerobic digester system manure 13 storage structure and a surface intake of a drainage well, 14 wellhead, cistern of an agricultural well, known sinkhole, 15 water source, or wetland. Division V of the bill provides 16 exceptions for a location or object and a farm pond or 17 privately owned lake. 18 Division V of the bill prohibits construction, expansion, 19 or diversion of a water source or the designation of a 20 wetland if the action would cause an anaerobic digester system 21 manure storage structure to be in violation of the distance 22 requirements. 23 Division V of the bill prohibits an anaerobic digester 24 system manure storage structure from being constructed on land 25 that is part of a 100 year floodplain as determined by DNR. 26 Division V of the bill states there are no distance 27 requirements between a location or object and a farm pond or 28 privately owned lake. Additionally, distance requirements 29 do not apply to an anaerobic digester system manure storage 30 structure constructed with a secondary containment barrier 31 approved by DNR. 32 Division V of the bill provides separation distances between 33 an anaerobic digester system manure storage structure and a 34 residence, bona fide religious institution, public use area, 35 -49- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 49/ 53 H.F. 834 commercial enterprise, educational institution, or public 1 thoroughfare. Division V of the bill allows the titleholder 2 of the land benefiting from the distance requirements to waive 3 the distance requirements. Division V of the bill allows the 4 state or political subdivision to waive distance requirements 5 of public thoroughfares. The waivers must be filed with the 6 county recorder before becoming effective. 7 Division V of the bill allows an anaerobic digester 8 system manure storage structure to be within the distance 9 requirement from a residence, educational institution, 10 commercial enterprise, bona fide religious institution, city, 11 or public use area if the anaerobic digester system manure 12 storage structure was operating in conformance with distance 13 requirements, but was brought within the distance requirement 14 due to the expansion or construction of a residence, 15 educational institution, commercial enterprise, bona fide 16 religious institution, city, or public use area. A change in 17 ownership or expansion of an anaerobic digester system shall 18 not change the established date of operation. 19 Division V of the bill requires an anaerobic digester system 20 to retain all digestate produced by operation between periods 21 of digestate disposal or delivery to animal feeding operations 22 and to dispose the digestate in a manner that will not cause 23 surface water or groundwater pollution. 24 Division V of the bill requires the owner of an anaerobic 25 digester system that discontinues the use of the operation to 26 remove all digestate from related anaerobic digester system 27 structures used to store digestate within six months following 28 the date that the anaerobic digester system is discontinued. 29 Division V of the bill requires materials returned to an 30 animal feeding operation for land application be accounted for 31 in the animal feeding operationâs manure management plan or 32 nutrient management plan and that the owner of the anaerobic 33 digester system must satisfy all applicable laws for proper 34 application of any portion of the digestate not returned to an 35 -50- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 50/ 53 H.F. 834 animal feeding operation. 1 Division V of the bill allows an anaerobic digester system to 2 stockpile materials prior to digestation or dry digestate so 3 long as the facility stockpiles the materials and dry digestate 4 in compliance with restrictions applicable to stockpiling as 5 provided in division V of the bill. Division V of the bill 6 prohibits anaerobic digester system stockpiles from commingling 7 with animal feeding operation stockpiles. 8 Division V of the bill provides separation distance 9 requirements between a stockpile and a designated area that 10 includes a known sinkhole, a cistern, an abandoned well, an 11 unplugged agricultural drainage well, an agricultural drainage 12 well surface inlet, a drinking water well, a designated 13 wetland, or a water source. Special separation distance 14 requirements are provided for a high-quality water resource, an 15 agricultural drainage well, or a known sinkhole. Division V 16 of the bill provides special separation distance requirements 17 between a stockpile and a terrace tile inlet or surface tile 18 inlet. An exception allows a stockpile to be located closer 19 than otherwise required from these water sources so long as it 20 is maintained in a manner that will not allow precipitation 21 induced runoff to drain from the material or dry digestate. 22 Division V of the bill also provides separation distance 23 requirements between a stockpile and a residence, bona fide 24 religious institution, public use area, commercial enterprise, 25 or educational institution. 26 Division V of the bill provides that a stockpile cannot be 27 located in a grassed waterway. The stockpile also cannot be 28 located on a slope of a certain grade, unless efforts are taken 29 to contain the stockpile and prevent runoff. 30 If the materials or dry digestate are not stockpiled on 31 karst terrain, division V of the bill does not provide any 32 requirements so long as the materials or dry digestate are 33 stockpiled for 15 days or less. Otherwise, division V of the 34 bill requires a person to comply with stockpiling requirements 35 -51- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 51/ 53 H.F. 834 or file a monthly inspection report with DNR. The special 1 stockpiling requirements include either the use of a structure 2 or the use of an impermeable cover. However, if the stockpile 3 is covered on a long-term basis, it must be sited on compacted 4 or other prepared ground. 5 Division V of the bill states that if a proposed stockpile 6 is located on potential karst terrain, a qualified person must 7 test the ground in conformance with requirements described in 8 division V of the bill and submit a soil report to confirm 9 whether the proposed stockpile location is on karst terrain. 10 If the material or dry digestate is stockpiled on karst 11 terrain, there must be a separation distance between the bottom 12 of the stockpile and the soluble rock, regardless of how long 13 the stockpile is located at that location. For material or dry 14 digestate that is stockpiled for more than 15 days, special 15 compliance requirements apply, including either the use of a 16 structure or an impermeable cover. If the stockpile is located 17 at that location on a long-term basis, it must be sited on 18 concrete. 19 Division V of the bill requires a person stockpiling 20 material or dry digestate to comply with all applicable 21 national pollutant discharge elimination system permit 22 requirements pursuant to the federal Water Pollution Control 23 Act. 24 Division V of the bill requires a person stockpiling 25 materials or dry digestate to remove the dry digestate and 26 apply it in accordance with the provisions of division V of the 27 bill within six months after the materials or dry digestate are 28 first stockpiled. 29 Division V of the bill directs DNR and the attorney general 30 to enforce Code chapter 459C in the same manner as provided in 31 Code chapter 459, subchapter VI. A person who violates the 32 provisions of division V of the bill for which the alleged harm 33 is related to air quality shall be subject to the same penalty 34 as provided in Code section 459.602. A person who violates 35 -52- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 52/ 53 H.F. 834 the provisions of division V of the bill for which the alleged 1 harm is related to water quality shall be subject to the same 2 penalties as provided in Code section 459.603. A habitual 3 violator of the provisions of division V of the bill shall be 4 subject to the same penalties and restrictions as provided in 5 Code sections 459.604 and 459.605. Any collected civil penalty 6 and interest on a civil penalty shall be credited to the Iowa 7 nutrient research fund created in Code section 466B.46. 8 -53- LSB 1121HV (2) 91 sb/js 53/ 53
