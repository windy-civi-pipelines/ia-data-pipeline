1 Section 1. Section 468.43, subsection 1, Code 2025, is
2 amended to read as follows:
3 1. When any public highway or other public land extends
4 into or through a levee or drainage district, the commissioners
5 to assess benefits shall ascertain and return in their report
6 the amount of benefits and the apportionment of costs and
7 expenses to such highway or other public land, and the board
8 of supervisors shall assess the same against such highway
9 and land. The apportionment of costs and expenses assessed
10 against a highway or other public land shall not exceed the
11 total assessment value multiplied by the quotient of the area
12 of the highway or other public land within a levee or drainage
13 district divided by the total area of all land, including the
14 highway or other public land, in such district.
15 EXPLANATION
16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
17 the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
18 Under current law, when a levee or drainage district is
19 improved, a county board of supervisors (board) must appoint
20 three commissioners to assess benefits and classify the lands
21 affected by the improvement. The commissioners are required to
22 classify the effected lands, fix the percentages of benefits,
23 apportion and assess the costs and expenses of constructing the
24 improvement, divide and rename original improvements, and, if
25 included in the board’s resolution, adopt special common outlet
26 classifications to be maintained independent of the district’s
27 regular assessment schedules. When any public highway or
28 other public land extends into or through a levee or drainage
29 district, the commissioners are required to ascertain and
30 report the amount of benefits and the apportionment of costs
31 and expenses to such highway or other public land, and the
32 board must assess the same against such highway and land.
33 This bill limits the amount, based on the percentage of
34 the total drainage district area that is the highway or
35 public land, that can be assessed against a highway or public
