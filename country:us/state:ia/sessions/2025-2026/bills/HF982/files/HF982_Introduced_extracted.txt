The program shall be a joint and cooperative undertaking 11 of the department of homeland security and emergency management 12 (HSEMD) and the Iowa finance authority (IFA). 13 The bill creates a natural hazard mitigation revolving loan 14 fund (fund) under the control of HSEMD, in consultation with 15 IFA, consisting of moneys and program funding as detailed in 16 the bill. 17 HSEMD, in consultation with IFA, may establish and maintain 18 funds or accounts necessary to carry out the purposes of the 19 bill. Any moneys appropriated to HSEMD and IFA for purposes 20 of paying the costs and expenses associated with the program 21 shall be administered as determined by IFA. The funds or 22 accounts are separate dedicated funds and accounts under the 23 administration and control of IFA, and shall not be considered 24 part of the general fund of the state, are not subject to 25 appropriation for any other purpose by the general assembly, 26 and in determining a general fund balance shall not be included 27 in the general fund of the state, but shall remain in the funds 28 and accounts maintained by HSEMD or IFA. IFA may provide for 29 the issuance of bonds or notes as detailed in the bill. 30 The duties of the director of HSEMD (director) are detailed 31 in the bill. 32 For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025, and each fiscal 33 year thereafter, HSEMD may prepare and deliver intended use 34 plans to, and enter into capitalization grant agreements with, 35 -89- LSB 1094HZ (2) 91 nls/ko 89/ 103 H.F. 982 the administrator of the United States federal emergency 1 management agency and may accept capitalization grants for the 2 fund.

IFA, in cooperation with HSEMD, shall determine 7 the interest rate and repayment terms for each loan under the 8 program and shall enter into a loan agreement with each loan 9 recipient. IFA may charge loan recipients fees and assess 10 costs as necessary. 11 Moneys in the fund shall be used for the primary purpose of 12 making loans to eligible entities to finance eligible costs of 13 projects in accordance with the intended use plans. The loan 14 recipients and the purpose and amount of the loans shall be 15 determined by the director. 16 HSEMD, in consultation with IFA, shall adopt rules pursuant 17 to Code chapter 17A to administer the division of the bill. 18 The bill makes a conforming change to Code section 422.7. 19 DIVISION II ââ DISASTER RECOVERY HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. 20 The bill requires a state of disaster emergency proclamation 21 by the governor that authorizes disaster recovery housing 22 assistance to specify if disaster recovery housing assistance 23 is available to homeowners, renters, or both homeowners and 24 renters. 25 The bill defines âfinancial assistanceâ as assistance 26 provided only from the funds, rights, and assets legally 27 available to IFA and includes but is not limited to assistance 28 in the form of grants, loans, and forgivable loans. 29 Under the bill, IFA shall not use more than 5 percent of the 30 moneys deposited into the disaster recovery housing assistance 31 fund for administrative and program costs. 32 Under current law, to be considered for financial assistance 33 under the disaster recovery housing assistance program, 34 a homeowner or renter must register for the disaster case 35 -90- LSB 1094HZ (2) 91 nls/ko 90/ 103 H.F. 982 advocacy program.

A 19 contract between a public adjuster and an insured executed in 20 violation of the bill shall not be enforceable. 21 The required standards of conduct for, and duties of, an 22 adjuster are detailed in the bill. An adjuster who fails 23 to comply with the standards and duties shall be subject to 24 penalties. 25 The division may place on probation, suspend, revoke, or 26 refuse to issue or renew an adjusterâs license, and may levy 27 a civil penalty for any of the reasons enumerated in the 28 bill. If the commissioner does not renew a license or denies 29 an application for a license, the commissioner shall notify 30 the adjuster or applicant and advise of the reason for the 31 nonrenewal or denial. The adjuster or applicant may request a 32 hearing within 30 days from the date of the notice. 33 The commissioner may conduct an investigation of any 34 suspected violation of the bill and may impose a penalty or 35 -94- LSB 1094HZ (2) 91 nls/ko 94/ 103 H.F. 982 remedy against any person who is under investigation for, or 1 charged with, a violation even if the personâs license has been 2 surrendered or has lapsed by operation of law. 3 All complaint files, investigation files, other 4 investigation reports, and other investigative information in 5 the possession of the commissioner that relates to adjuster 6 discipline are privileged and confidential, and may only be 7 disclosed as described in the bill. On appeal by the adjuster, 8 the commissioner shall transmit the entire record of the 9 contested case to the reviewing court. 10 Upon a determination by the commissioner, after a hearing, 11 that an adjuster has violated a provision of the bill, 12 the commissioner shall reduce the findings of the hearing 13 to writing and deliver a copy to the adjuster. Upon a 14 determination by the commissioner that an adjuster has engaged 15 in any act or practice constituting a violation of the bill, 16 the commissioner may take any of the civil actions described 17 in the bill. 18 A person acting as an adjuster without proper licensure, 19 or an adjuster who willfully violates any provision of, or 20 order issued under, Code chapter 522C is guilty of a class 21 âDâ felony. When the violation results in a loss of more 22 than $10,000, the person or adjuster is guilty of a class âCâ 23 felony. 24 An adjuster who steals, converts, or misappropriates funds 25 that should be held in trust in a fiduciary capacity is guilty 26 of a class âDâ felony. When the violation results in a loss 27 of more than $10,000, the adjuster is guilty of a class âCâ 28 felony. 29 A class âDâ felony is punishable by confinement for no more 30 than five years and a fine of at least $1,025 but not more than 31 $10,245. A class âCâ felony is punishable by confinement for 32 no more than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,370 but not more 33 than $13,660. 34 The commissioner may refer evidence concerning violations of 35 -95- LSB 1094HZ (2) 91 nls/ko 95/ 103 H.F. 982 the bill to the attorney general or the county attorney who may 1 institute criminal proceedings. 2 Any contract that is entered into by an insured with a person 3 who is not a licensed public adjuster shall be void, and the 4 insured is not liable for the payment of any past or future 5 services by the person under that contract or otherwise. 6 An adjuster whose license has been revoked or suspended, 7 or who forfeited a license, may apply to the commissioner for 8 reinstatement or reissuance and submit to a criminal history 9 check. An applicant shall not be eligible for reinstatement 10 or reissuance until the applicant satisfies the requirements 11 detailed in the bill. 12 An application for reinstatement or reissuance shall allege 13 facts as required by the bill, and the burden of proof is on 14 the adjuster to establish such facts. An adjuster may request 15 reinstatement of a suspended license prior to the end of the 16 suspension term. If an order of revocation or suspension did 17 not establish terms on which reinstatement or reissuance may 18 occur, or if the license was forfeited, an initial application 19 for reinstatement or reissuance shall not be made until at 20 least one year from the date of the order. All proceedings on 21 the application for reinstatement or reissuance shall be held 22 in accordance with Code chapter 17A. 23 If an adjusterâs ordered suspension period ends prior to 24 the adjusterâs license expiration date, and the adjuster 25 applies for reinstatement and meets all requirements, the 26 division shall reinstate the license as soon as practicable 27 but no earlier than the end of the suspension period. If an 28 adjusterâs license is suspended beyond the adjusterâs license 29 expiration date, the adjuster must apply for reissuance. A 30 submission of voluntary forfeiture of a license shall be made 31 to the commissioner pursuant to the requirements detailed in 32 the bill. 33 The commissioner may deny an application for reinstatement 34 or reissuance, or bring an additional immediate action, if an 35 -96- LSB 1094HZ (2) 91 nls/ko 96/ 103 H.F. 982 adjuster has engaged in an additional violation of Code chapter 1 507B or 522C. 2 The commissioner shall deny an adjusterâs application for 3 license issuance, renewal, reinstatement, or reissuance; 4 suspend a current license; or revoke a currently suspended 5 license, upon receipt of a certificate of noncompliance from 6 the child support recovery unit or the centralized collection 7 unit of the department of revenue. 8 DIVISION VI ââ LICENSING AND REGULATION OF APPRAISERS 9 AND UMPIRES.

When the violation results in a loss of 29 more than $10,000, the person or adjuster is guilty of a class 30 âCâ felony. 31 A class âDâ felony is punishable by confinement for no more 32 than five years and a fine of at least $1,025 but not more than 33 $10,245. A class âCâ felony is punishable by confinement for 34 no more than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,370 but not more 35 -101- LSB 1094HZ (2) 91 nls/ko 101/ 103 H.F. 982 than $13,660. 1 The commissioner may refer such evidence concerning 2 violations of the bill, or of the failure of a person to comply 3 with the licensing requirements under the bill, to the attorney 4 general or the district attorney who may institute criminal 5 proceedings. 6 An appraiser or an umpire whose license has been revoked or 7 suspended by order, or who forfeited a license, may apply to 8 the commissioner for reinstatement or reissuance, and submit to 9 a criminal history check. 10 All proceedings on the application for reinstatement or 11 reissuance shall be held in accordance with Code chapter 17A. 12 An order of reinstatement or reissuance shall be based on a 13 written decision, and may impose such terms and conditions as 14 the commissioner deems appropriate. 15 If an appraiserâs or an umpireâs ordered suspension period 16 ends prior to the appraiserâs or umpireâs license expiration 17 date and the adjuster applies for reinstatement and meets all 18 applicable requirements, the division shall reinstate the 19 license as soon as practicable but no earlier than the end 20 of the suspension period.

The program shall be a joint and cooperative undertaking 11 of the department of homeland security and emergency management 12 (HSEMD) and the Iowa finance authority (IFA). 13 The bill creates a natural hazard mitigation revolving loan 14 fund (fund) under the control of HSEMD, in consultation with 15 IFA, consisting of moneys and program funding as detailed in 16 the bill. 17 HSEMD, in consultation with IFA, may establish and maintain 18 funds or accounts necessary to carry out the purposes of the 19 bill. Any moneys appropriated to HSEMD and IFA for purposes 20 of paying the costs and expenses associated with the program 21 shall be administered as determined by IFA. The funds or 22 accounts are separate dedicated funds and accounts under the 23 administration and control of IFA, and shall not be considered 24 part of the general fund of the state, are not subject to 25 appropriation for any other purpose by the general assembly, 26 and in determining a general fund balance shall not be included 27 in the general fund of the state, but shall remain in the funds 28 and accounts maintained by HSEMD or IFA. IFA may provide for 29 the issuance of bonds or notes as detailed in the bill. 30 The duties of the director of HSEMD (director) are detailed 31 in the bill. 32 For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025, and each fiscal 33 year thereafter, HSEMD may prepare and deliver intended use 34 plans to, and enter into capitalization grant agreements with, 35 -89- LSB 1094HZ (2) 91 nls/ko 89/ 103 H.F. 982 the administrator of the United States federal emergency 1 management agency and may accept capitalization grants for the 2 fund.

IFA, in cooperation with HSEMD, shall determine 7 the interest rate and repayment terms for each loan under the 8 program and shall enter into a loan agreement with each loan 9 recipient. IFA may charge loan recipients fees and assess 10 costs as necessary. 11 Moneys in the fund shall be used for the primary purpose of 12 making loans to eligible entities to finance eligible costs of 13 projects in accordance with the intended use plans. The loan 14 recipients and the purpose and amount of the loans shall be 15 determined by the director. 16 HSEMD, in consultation with IFA, shall adopt rules pursuant 17 to Code chapter 17A to administer the division of the bill. 18 The bill makes a conforming change to Code section 422.7. 19 DIVISION II ââ DISASTER RECOVERY HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. 20 The bill requires a state of disaster emergency proclamation 21 by the governor that authorizes disaster recovery housing 22 assistance to specify if disaster recovery housing assistance 23 is available to homeowners, renters, or both homeowners and 24 renters. 25 The bill defines âfinancial assistanceâ as assistance 26 provided only from the funds, rights, and assets legally 27 available to IFA and includes but is not limited to assistance 28 in the form of grants, loans, and forgivable loans. 29 Under the bill, IFA shall not use more than 5 percent of the 30 moneys deposited into the disaster recovery housing assistance 31 fund for administrative and program costs. 32 Under current law, to be considered for financial assistance 33 under the disaster recovery housing assistance program, 34 a homeowner or renter must register for the disaster case 35 -90- LSB 1094HZ (2) 91 nls/ko 90/ 103 H.F. 982 advocacy program.

An adjuster shall 30 immediately notify the division if the adjusterâs evidence 31 of responsibility terminates or becomes impaired, and the 32 adjusterâs license shall become inactive. 33 An individual applying for a license shall pass a written 34 examination, unless exempt, as described in the bill. 35 -93- LSB 1094HZ (2) 91 nls/ko 93/ 103 H.F. 982 A public adjuster shall not provide services to an insured 1 until a written contract with the insured has been executed. 2 The contract must meet all of the requirements detailed in the 3 bill. No provisions in the contract shall be redacted in a 4 copy of the contract submitted to the commissioner. 5 If the insurer, no later than five calendar days after the 6 date on which the insuredâs loss is reported, either pays 7 or commits in writing to pay the policy limits, the public 8 adjuster shall inform the insured that the total amount of 9 loss claimed by the insured may not be paid by the insured, 10 and the adjuster is only entitled to reasonable compensation 11 from the insured. Prior to execution of a contract, the public 12 adjuster shall review the terms of the contract with the 13 insured and provide a separate disclosure document that meets 14 the requirements detailed in the bill. 15 An original copy of a completed contract shall be provided to 16 the public adjuster and kept by the insured. Within 72 hours 17 of entering a contract with an insured, the public adjuster 18 shall provide the insuredâs insurer a notification letter. A 19 contract between a public adjuster and an insured executed in 20 violation of the bill shall not be enforceable. 21 The required standards of conduct for, and duties of, an 22 adjuster are detailed in the bill. An adjuster who fails 23 to comply with the standards and duties shall be subject to 24 penalties. 25 The division may place on probation, suspend, revoke, or 26 refuse to issue or renew an adjusterâs license, and may levy 27 a civil penalty for any of the reasons enumerated in the 28 bill. If the commissioner does not renew a license or denies 29 an application for a license, the commissioner shall notify 30 the adjuster or applicant and advise of the reason for the 31 nonrenewal or denial. The adjuster or applicant may request a 32 hearing within 30 days from the date of the notice. 33 The commissioner may conduct an investigation of any 34 suspected violation of the bill and may impose a penalty or 35 -94- LSB 1094HZ (2) 91 nls/ko 94/ 103 H.F. 982 remedy against any person who is under investigation for, or 1 charged with, a violation even if the personâs license has been 2 surrendered or has lapsed by operation of law. 3 All complaint files, investigation files, other 4 investigation reports, and other investigative information in 5 the possession of the commissioner that relates to adjuster 6 discipline are privileged and confidential, and may only be 7 disclosed as described in the bill. On appeal by the adjuster, 8 the commissioner shall transmit the entire record of the 9 contested case to the reviewing court. 10 Upon a determination by the commissioner, after a hearing, 11 that an adjuster has violated a provision of the bill, 12 the commissioner shall reduce the findings of the hearing 13 to writing and deliver a copy to the adjuster. Upon a 14 determination by the commissioner that an adjuster has engaged 15 in any act or practice constituting a violation of the bill, 16 the commissioner may take any of the civil actions described 17 in the bill. 18 A person acting as an adjuster without proper licensure, 19 or an adjuster who willfully violates any provision of, or 20 order issued under, Code chapter 522C is guilty of a class 21 âDâ felony. When the violation results in a loss of more 22 than $10,000, the person or adjuster is guilty of a class âCâ 23 felony. 24 An adjuster who steals, converts, or misappropriates funds 25 that should be held in trust in a fiduciary capacity is guilty 26 of a class âDâ felony. When the violation results in a loss 27 of more than $10,000, the adjuster is guilty of a class âCâ 28 felony. 29 A class âDâ felony is punishable by confinement for no more 30 than five years and a fine of at least $1,025 but not more than 31 $10,245. A class âCâ felony is punishable by confinement for 32 no more than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,370 but not more 33 than $13,660. 34 The commissioner may refer evidence concerning violations of 35 -95- LSB 1094HZ (2) 91 nls/ko 95/ 103 H.F. 982 the bill to the attorney general or the county attorney who may 1 institute criminal proceedings. 2 Any contract that is entered into by an insured with a person 3 who is not a licensed public adjuster shall be void, and the 4 insured is not liable for the payment of any past or future 5 services by the person under that contract or otherwise. 6 An adjuster whose license has been revoked or suspended, 7 or who forfeited a license, may apply to the commissioner for 8 reinstatement or reissuance and submit to a criminal history 9 check. An applicant shall not be eligible for reinstatement 10 or reissuance until the applicant satisfies the requirements 11 detailed in the bill. 12 An application for reinstatement or reissuance shall allege 13 facts as required by the bill, and the burden of proof is on 14 the adjuster to establish such facts. An adjuster may request 15 reinstatement of a suspended license prior to the end of the 16 suspension term. If an order of revocation or suspension did 17 not establish terms on which reinstatement or reissuance may 18 occur, or if the license was forfeited, an initial application 19 for reinstatement or reissuance shall not be made until at 20 least one year from the date of the order. All proceedings on 21 the application for reinstatement or reissuance shall be held 22 in accordance with Code chapter 17A. 23 If an adjusterâs ordered suspension period ends prior to 24 the adjusterâs license expiration date, and the adjuster 25 applies for reinstatement and meets all requirements, the 26 division shall reinstate the license as soon as practicable 27 but no earlier than the end of the suspension period. If an 28 adjusterâs license is suspended beyond the adjusterâs license 29 expiration date, the adjuster must apply for reissuance. A 30 submission of voluntary forfeiture of a license shall be made 31 to the commissioner pursuant to the requirements detailed in 32 the bill. 33 The commissioner may deny an application for reinstatement 34 or reissuance, or bring an additional immediate action, if an 35 -96- LSB 1094HZ (2) 91 nls/ko 96/ 103 H.F. 982 adjuster has engaged in an additional violation of Code chapter 1 507B or 522C. 2 The commissioner shall deny an adjusterâs application for 3 license issuance, renewal, reinstatement, or reissuance; 4 suspend a current license; or revoke a currently suspended 5 license, upon receipt of a certificate of noncompliance from 6 the child support recovery unit or the centralized collection 7 unit of the department of revenue. 8 DIVISION VI ââ LICENSING AND REGULATION OF APPRAISERS 9 AND UMPIRES.

The 14 commissioner may adopt rules to administer this division of the 15 bill. 16 Under the bill, a person shall not act as, or represent that 17 the person is, an appraiser or an umpire unless the person is 18 licensed. 19 A person applying for an appraiser or umpire license shall 20 submit an application prescribed by the commissioner.

The 3 claimant and the insurer must both provide the other party with 4 a list stating separately the actual cash value and the amount 5 of claimed loss for each item at issue. Within 20 calendar 6 days of receipt of a written demand for an appraisal, the 7 claimant and the insurer shall each select an appraiser from 8 the appraiser list. Upon selection, the appraiser shall attest 9 that the appraiser is competent and disinterested with regards 10 to the appraisal. 11 Within 15 calendar days of the selection of appraisers, both 12 appraisers shall agree on an umpire from the umpire list. A 13 party or an appraiser may object to the umpire for good cause 14 no later than five business days after the umpire has been 15 selected. A replacement umpire shall then be selected by both 16 appraisers from the umpire list. If both appraisers fail to 17 agree on an umpire, the division shall randomly select an 18 umpire from the umpire list and notify the parties. If either 19 appraiser requests that an umpire be selected by a judge, a 20 judge shall give deference to the randomly selected umpire from 21 the umpire list by the division unless either the claimant 22 or the insurer provides good cause for the judge to make an 23 alternative selection. 24 Within 45 calendar days from the date the umpire is 25 selected, both appraisers shall appraise the loss and submit 26 the appraiserâs actual cash value and amount of loss of each 27 item to the umpire.

An appraiser 15 or umpire who willfully fails to comply with such requirements 16 is subject to penalty. 17 An appraiser or umpire has a continuing duty and obligation 18 to keep usual and customary records pertaining to appraisals 19 in accordance with the requirements of the bill. An appraiser 20 or umpire who willfully fails to comply with such requirements 21 is subject to penalty. 22 Whenever the commissioner believes that a person has been 23 engaged or is engaging in a violation of the bill, and that a 24 proceeding by the commissioner would be in the public interest, 25 the commissioner shall issue and serve a statement of the 26 charges and a notice of a hearing. 27 The division may place on probation, suspend, revoke, 28 or refuse to issue or renew an appraiserâs license or an 29 umpireâs license, and may levy a civil penalty for any of 30 the causes detailed in the bill.

A hearing shall 1 be conducted pursuant to the requirements detailed in the 2 bill. The license of an umpire, an appraiser, or an appraiser 3 business entity may be suspended, revoked, placed on probation, 4 or refused if the commissioner finds that an umpireâs, 5 appraiserâs, or appraiser business entityâs violation was known 6 or should have been known by a partner, officer, or manager of 7 the business entity and the violation was not reported to the 8 commissioner and corrective action was not taken. 9 In addition to, or in lieu of, denial, probation, 10 suspension, or revocation of a license, an appraiser or umpire 11 may be subject to a civil penalty.
