The bill 12 prohibits the commission from granting a company the right of 13 eminent domain for an interstate hazardous liquid pipeline 14 project unless the company first acquires all applicable 15 pipeline construction and zoning permits from the other states 16 the project will be constructed in. 17 The bill allows a landowner to file a complaint with 18 the commission and to notify the relevant county board of 19 supervisors of a violation of land restoration standards. The 20 bill expands the meaning of âlandownerâ under Code section 21 479B.20 to include a farm tenant. 22 The bill expands damages that constitute compensable 23 loss under Code section 479B.29 to include soil compaction, 24 damage to soil or water conservation structures, and damage 25 to irrigation or drainage systems, and adds âfarm tenantâ to 26 the definition of âlandownerâ.

Violations of the bill shall be reported 7 to the commission, which shall set a public hearing. If the 8 commission finds a violation has occurred, the commission shall 9 fine the company $1,000 per violation and collect and deliver 10 the amount to the affected landowner. 11 The bill provides an affected landowner a cause of action 12 against a company in violation of the provisions of the bill. 13 The bill provides that a company seeking eminent domain 14 rights shall include investor information in the application 15 for a permit submitted to the commission. The permit 16 application shall include the names and home addresses of all 17 planned pipeline investors and the range of planned investment 18 per investor as indicated in the bill. 19 The bill removes a provision allowing a company to enter upon 20 private land for the purpose of surveying and examining the 21 land by giving 10 daysâ written notice to a landowner. 22 Division II of the bill takes effect upon enactment. 23 Division II of the bill applies retroactively to all 24 applications for a permit to construct a pipeline pursuant 25 to Code chapter 479B filed with the commission on or after 26 July 1, 2021.
