However, such structures shall be 11 treated similarly to agricultural structures constructed 12 before January 1, 2026, when applying any equalization 13 order of the department. Such agricultural structures shall 14 instead be valued according to the structureâs replacement 15 cost less depreciation and obsolescence and the structureâs 16 assessed value subject to taxation prior to application of any 17 assessment limitation under subsection 4 shall be equal to the 18 product of the structureâs value multiplied by the agricultural 19 factor, as determined in 701 IAC 102.3(2) or succeeding rule of 20 the department. Any formula or method employed to determine 21 productivity and net earning capacity of property shall be 22 adopted in full by rule. 23 Sec. 55. Section 441.21, subsection 2, Code 2025, is amended 24 to read as follows: 25 2. In the event market value of the property being assessed 26 cannot be readily established in the foregoing manner, then 27 the assessor may determine the value of the property using the 28 other uniform and recognized appraisal methods including its 29 productive and earning capacity, if any, industrial conditions, 30 its cost, physical and functional depreciation and obsolescence 31 and replacement cost, and all other factors which would assist 32 in determining the fair and reasonable market value of the 33 property but the actual value shall not be determined by use 34 of only one such factor. The following shall not be taken into 35 -29- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 29/ 85 S.F. 651 consideration: Special value or use value of the property to 1 its present owner, and the goodwill or value of a business 2 which uses the property as distinguished from the value of 3 the property as property. In addition, for assessment years 4 beginning on or after January 1, 2018, and unless otherwise 5 required for property valued by the department of revenue 6 pursuant to chapters 428 , 437 , and 438 , the assessor shall not 7 take into consideration and shall not request from any person 8 sales or receipts data, expense data, balance sheets, bank 9 account information, or other data related to the financial 10 condition of a business operating in whole or in part on the 11 property if the property is both classified as commercial or 12 industrial property and owned and used by the owner of the 13 business. However, in assessing property that is rented or 14 leased to low-income individuals and families as authorized by 15 section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and which 16 section limits the amount that the individual or family pays 17 for the rental or lease of units in the property, the assessor 18 shall, unless the owner elects to withdraw the property from 19 the assessment procedures for section 42 property, use the 20 productive and earning capacity from the actual rents received 21 as a method of appraisal and shall take into account the extent 22 to which that use and limitation reduces the market value of 23 the property. The assessor shall not consider any tax credit 24 equity or other subsidized financing as income provided to 25 the property in determining the assessed value. The property 26 owner shall notify the assessor when property is withdrawn 27 from section 42 eligibility under the Internal Revenue Code 28 or if the owner elects to withdraw the property from the 29 assessment procedures for section 42 property under this 30 subsection . The property shall not be subject to section 42 31 assessment procedures for the assessment year for which section 32 42 eligibility is withdrawn or an election is made. This 33 notification must be provided to the assessor no later than 34 March 1 of the assessment year or the owner will be subject to a 35 -30- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 30/ 85 S.F. 651 penalty of five hundred dollars for that assessment year. The 1 penalty shall be collected at the same time and in the same 2 manner as regular property taxes. An election to withdraw 3 from the assessment procedures for section 42 property is 4 irrevocable. Property that is withdrawn from the assessment 5 procedures for section 42 property shall be classified and 6 assessed as residential multiresidential property unless the 7 property otherwise fails to meet the requirements of subsection 8 14 13 . Upon adoption of uniform rules by the department of 9 revenue or succeeding authority covering assessments and 10 valuations of such properties, the valuation on such properties 11 shall be determined in accordance with such rules and in 12 accordance with forms and guidelines contained in the real 13 property appraisal manual prepared by the department as updated 14 from time to time for assessment purposes to assure uniformity, 15 but such rules, forms, and guidelines shall not be inconsistent 16 with or change the foregoing means of determining the actual, 17 market, taxable, and assessed values. 18 Sec. 56.

EFFECTIVE DATE. This division of this Act takes 15 effect January 1, 2026. 16 Sec. 115. APPLICABILITY. This division of this Act applies 17 to property taxes due and payable in fiscal years beginning on 18 or after July 1, 2026. 19 EXPLANATION 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 21 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 22 This bill relates to local government property taxes, 23 financial authority, and budgets. 24 DIVISION I ââ COUNTY PROPERTY TAXES AND BUDGETS. Code 25 section 331.423 establishes a levy rate limitation for the 26 general county services levy and a limitation for the rural 27 county services levy. The bill modifies the general county 28 services levy rate limitation for the fiscal year beginning 29 July 1, 2026, to be a levy rate not to exceed the greater of: 30 (1) a levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value equal to 1,000 31 multiplied by the quotient of 102 percent of the current fiscal 32 yearâs (immediately preceding fiscal year) actual property tax 33 dollars certified for levy for general county services divided 34 by the remainder of the total assessed value used to calculate 35 -70- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 70/ 85 S.F. 651 such taxes for the budget year minus value attributable to new 1 valuation, as defined in the bill; and (2) a levy rate per 2 $1,000 of assessed value that results in an amount of actual 3 property tax dollars certified for levy for general county 4 services equal to 100.5 percent of the actual property tax 5 dollars certified for such levy for the current fiscal year. 6 For each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2027, 7 the maximum levy rate is the levy rate imposed by the county 8 for the current fiscal year unless the total assessed value, 9 excluding new valuation, used to calculate taxes for general 10 county services for the budget year is equal to or exceeds 102 11 percent of the total assessed value used to calculate taxes for 12 general county services for the current fiscal year, and for 13 the budget year beginning July 1, 2027, only, not less than 14 a levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value that results in an 15 amount of actual property tax dollars certified for levy equal 16 to 100.5 percent of the actual property tax dollars certified 17 for levy for the current fiscal year. 18 If the total assessed value, excluding value attributable 19 to new valuation, used to calculate taxes for general county 20 services for the budget year is equal to or exceeds 102 percent 21 of the total assessed value used to calculate taxes for general 22 county services for the current fiscal year, the levy rate 23 imposed shall not exceed a levy rate per $1,000 of assessed 24 value that is equal to 1,000 multiplied by the quotient 25 obtained by dividing the product of the budget adjustment 26 factor, as defined in the bill and which ranges from 102 27 percent to 105 percent depending upon the amount of annual 28 increase in the consumer price index, multiplied by the current 29 fiscal yearâs actual property tax dollars certified for levy 30 by the remainder of the total assessed value used to calculate 31 such taxes for the budget year minus value attributable to new 32 valuation. 33 The bill similarly modifies the maximum levy rate for rural 34 county services for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 35 -71- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 71/ 85 S.F. 651 2026. 1 The division takes effect January 1, 2026, and applies to 2 county taxes and budgets for fiscal years beginning on or after 3 July 1, 2026. 4 DIVISION II ââ CITY PROPERTY TAXES AND BUDGETS. Code 5 section 384.1 establishes the city general fund levy and limits 6 on the levy rate. The bill modifies the general fund levy 7 rate limitation for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2026, 8 to be a levy rate not to exceed the greater of: (1) a levy 9 rate per $1,000 of assessed value equal to 1,000 multiplied 10 by the quotient of 102 percent of the current fiscal yearâs 11 (immediately preceding fiscal year) actual property tax dollars 12 certified for levy divided by the remainder of the total 13 assessed value used to calculate such taxes for the budget year 14 minus value attributable to new valuation, as defined in the 15 bill; and (2) a levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value that 16 results in an amount of actual property tax dollars certified 17 for levy equal to 100.5 percent of the actual property tax 18 dollars certified for such levy for the current fiscal year. 19 For each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2027, the 20 maximum levy rate is the levy rate imposed by the city for the 21 current fiscal year unless the total assessed value, excluding 22 new valuation, used to calculate taxes for the budget year is 23 equal to or exceeds 102 percent of the total assessed value 24 used to calculate taxes for the current fiscal year, and for 25 the budget year beginning July 1, 2027, only, not less than 26 a levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value that results in an 27 amount of actual property tax dollars certified for levy equal 28 to 100.5 percent of the actual property tax dollars certified 29 for levy for the current fiscal year. 30 If the total assessed value, excluding value attributable 31 to new valuation, used to calculate taxes for the city general 32 fund for the budget year is equal to or exceeds 102 percent 33 of the total assessed value used to calculate taxes for the 34 current fiscal year, the levy rate imposed shall not exceed a 35 -72- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 72/ 85 S.F. 651 levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value that is equal to 1,000 1 multiplied by the quotient obtained by dividing the product 2 of the budget adjustment factor, as defined in the bill and 3 which ranges from 102 percent to 105 percent depending upon 4 the amount of annual increase in the consumer price index, 5 multiplied by the current fiscal yearâs actual property tax 6 dollars certified for levy by the remainder of the total 7 assessed value used to calculate such taxes for the budget year 8 minus value attributable to new valuation. 9 The bill also establishes a methodology to determine a 10 maximum levy rate for a city that is not imposing a general 11 fund levy in the current fiscal year. 12 The division takes effect January 1, 2026, and applies to 13 property taxes and budgets for fiscal years beginning on or 14 after July 1, 2026. 15 DIVISION III ââ SCHOOL TAXES AND BUDGETS. As part of 16 the state school foundation program, for school budget 17 years beginning on or after July 1, 2022, Code section 257.1 18 establishes the regular program foundation base to be 88.4 19 percent of the regular program state cost per pupil. Beginning 20 with the budget year beginning July 1, 2026, the bill increases 21 that percentage to 100 percent. Similarly, the bill increases 22 the special education support services foundation base 23 percentage from 79 percent to 100 percent. 24 Code section 257.3 requires school districts to levy a 25 foundation property tax of $5.40 per $1,000 of assessed value 26 on all taxable property in the school district. The bill 27 reduces the foundation property tax levy rate to $4.48662 per 28 $1,000 of assessed value for budget years beginning on or after 29 July 1, 2026. 30 Code section 257.3 provides an exception to the foundation 31 property tax levy rate of $5.40 for those school districts that 32 have recently been reorganized. Such districts are provided 33 reduced foundation property tax levy rates for three years 34 following the reorganization. The bill adjusts those reduced 35 -73- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 73/ 85 S.F. 651 rates for reorganizations that take effect on or after July 1 1, 2026, to reflect the reduction made in the bill to the 2 foundation property tax levy imposed by school districts that 3 are not subject to a reorganization and eliminates certain 4 supplemental aid related to such reorganized school district 5 rates for budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2026. 6 The bill eliminates certain property tax adjustment aid 7 under Code section 257.15(2) and (3) for fiscal years beginning 8 on or after July 1, 2026. 9 The bill eliminates the $24 million general fund 10 appropriation for adjusted additional property tax levy aid 11 under Code section 257.15(4) for fiscal years beginning on 12 or after July 1, 2026. The bill also eliminates the annual 13 appropriation of the balance of the property tax equity and 14 relief fund under Code section 257.16A for purposes designated 15 under Code section 257.15(4) and requires remaining moneys at 16 the end of a specified fiscal year to be transferred back to 17 the funds from which they were received. 18 The bill eliminates the payment of school district property 19 tax replacement payments for fiscal years beginning on or after 20 July 1, 2026. 21 The bill eliminates the annual appropriation of moneys in 22 the foundation base supplement fund for fiscal years beginning 23 on or after July 1, 2026, and requires the remaining moneys 24 at the end of a specified fiscal year to be transferred for 25 deposit in the secure an advanced vision for education fund. 26 The bill eliminates transfers from the secure an advanced 27 vision for education fund to the property tax equity and relief 28 fund and the foundation base supplement fund for fiscal years 29 beginning on or after July 1, 2026, and instead provides that 30 such amounts shall be credited to the state general fund to be 31 used for increased foundation aid resulting from the increase 32 in the regular program foundation base per pupil to 100 percent 33 of the regular program state cost per pupil. 34 In Code chapters 425A (family farm tax credit) and 426 35 -74- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 74/ 85 S.F. 651 (agricultural land tax credit), the bill replaces references 1 to the school foundation property tax levy rate ($5.40) with 2 citations to the appropriate provision of the Code section 3 establishing the foundation property tax rate. 4 The bill requires each school district with an unexpended 5 fund balance in the districtâs management levy fund under 6 Code section 298A.3 at the conclusion of the fiscal year 7 beginning July 1, 2024, that exceeds an amount equal to the 8 total expenditures from the districtâs management fund for the 9 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024, to certify such unexpended 10 fund balance and expenditure amounts, including any reserved 11 or designated amounts in the fund and the purposes therefor, 12 to the school budget review committee by November 15, 2025. 13 The committee is then required to conduct a review of the 14 unexpended fund balances and expenditures of school district 15 management levy funds certified under the bill. By February 16 1, 2026, the committee shall make recommendations to the 17 general assembly for establishing district management levy fund 18 unexpended fund balance limitations for fiscal years beginning 19 on or after July 1, 2027, including recommendations for 20 limitations based on a percentage of the districtâs management 21 levy fund expenditures and recommendations for management levy 22 limitations and expenditure requirements for excess funds. 23 The bill amends several provisions relating to the state 24 school foundation program funding formula to include funding 25 for the media services funding and educational services funding 26 under Code section 257.37 to be included and funded as part of 27 foundation aid paid by the state instead of funding through a 28 school districtâs additional property tax under Code section 29 257.4 for school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 30 2026. 31 The bill reduces by approximately 70 percent the maximum 32 levy rates for the regular and voter-approved physical plant 33 and equipment levy under Code section 298.2 and the school 34 district bond tax under Code section 298.18. The bill also 35 -75- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 75/ 85 S.F. 651 repeals an obsolete provision relating to levy adjustments 1 authorized to occur before June 30, 2007, in Code section 2 298.18A. 3 The bill also amends Code section 298.4 by providing that for 4 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2027, if a school 5 districtâs unexpended fund balance of the districtâs management 6 levy fund is equal to or exceeds a specified percentage of the 7 average annual expenditures from the districtâs management 8 levy fund for the three consecutive fiscal years immediately 9 preceding the base year, the board of directors may not certify 10 a district management levy for the fiscal year. Additionally, 11 if a school district is not prohibited from certifying a levy 12 under the bill, the maximum amount that the board of directors 13 may certify for levy under the district management levy shall 14 be an amount equal to the remainder of a specified percentage 15 of the average annual expenditures from the districtâs 16 management levy fund for the three consecutive fiscal years 17 immediately preceding the base year minus the districtâs 18 management levy fund unexpended fund balance for the fiscal 19 year preceding the base year. 20 Except for the section of the division amending Code section 21 257.31, which relates to the school budget review committee, 22 this division of the bill takes effect January 1, 2026, and 23 applies to fiscal years and school budget years beginning on 24 or after July 1, 2026. 25 DIVISION IV ââ PROPERTY VALUATIONS AND ASSESSMENT 26 LIMITATIONS. Code section 441.21 provides that the actual 27 value of agricultural property shall be determined on the 28 basis of productivity and net earning capacity and that any 29 formula or method employed to determine productivity and net 30 earning capacity of property shall be adopted in full by rule 31 of the department of revenue. The bill amends that provision 32 by specifying that for assessment years beginning on or after 33 January 1, 2026, structures on agricultural land constructed on 34 or after January 1, 2026, that are not agricultural dwellings 35 -76- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 76/ 85 S.F. 651 shall not be included in determination of productivity and 1 net earning capacity of agricultural property and shall not 2 be allocated any portion of the total county productivity 3 value so determined. Such agricultural structures shall 4 instead be valued according to the structureâs replacement 5 cost less depreciation and obsolescence and the structureâs 6 assessed value subject to taxation prior to application of 7 any assessment limitation shall be equal to the product of 8 the structureâs value multiplied by the agricultural factor, 9 as determined in 701 IAC 102.3(2) or succeeding rule of the 10 department. The bill also provides that such structures shall 11 be treated similarly to agricultural structures constructed 12 before January 1, 2026, when applying any equalization order 13 of the department of revenue. 14 The bill modifies the list of examples of abnormal property 15 transactions that are to be excluded from consideration or 16 adjusted to eliminate distortions of market value when valuing 17 property to include built-to-suit construction, sale-leaseback 18 transactions, leased fee sales, and instead of sales to 19 immediate family, sales between related parties. 20 Code section 441.21(4) establishes the calculation for 21 assessment limitations (rollback) for residential property and 22 agricultural property. The bill strikes the calculation of 23 the residential property assessment limitation for assessment 24 years beginning on or after January 1, 2025, and strikes 25 the provision within the agricultural property assessment 26 limitation calculation that limits growth of residential or 27 agricultural property to the growth in the other classification 28 (ag-residential tie). The bill provides that residential 29 property is assessed at 75 percent of the propertyâs actual 30 value for assessment years beginning January 1, 2025, and 31 January 1, 2026. The bill then increases the percentage of 32 actual value at which residential property is assessed by 2.5 33 percent each assessment year until the percentage reaches 100 34 percent for assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 35 -77- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 77/ 85 S.F. 651 2036. By operation of law and through changes in the bill, 1 all other classifications of property, except for agricultural 2 property, residential property, and multiresidential property, 3 are assessed at 100 percent of actual value for assessment 4 years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. 5 The bill modifies provisions governing the calculation 6 of payments made to local governments under Code section 7 441.21(5)(e) that are made to replace property taxes due to the 8 application of the residential property assessment limitation 9 to certain portions of commercial and industrial property 10 valuations and eliminates the appropriation for such payments 11 for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2026, due to 12 elimination of the assessment limitations. 13 The bill also reestablishes a multiresidential property 14 classification for assessment years beginning on or after 15 January 1, 2026, that includes types of property that were 16 classified as multiresidential property for assessment years 17 beginning before January 1, 2022. Such property is included 18 within the residential property classification under current 19 law. Under the bill, for purposes of equalization under Code 20 sections 441.47 through 441.49, multiresidential property shall 21 be considered residential property. The bill provides that 22 multiresidential property is assessed at 75 percent of actual 23 value for the assessment year beginning January 1, 2026. The 24 bill then increases the percentage of actual value at which 25 multiresidential property is assessed by 2.5 percent each 26 assessment year until the percentage reaches 100 percent for 27 assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2036. 28 Except for provisions relating to the reestablishment of the 29 multiresidential property classification, this division of the 30 bill applies retroactively to assessment years beginning on or 31 after January 1, 2025. 32 DIVISION V ââ DISABLED VETERAN AND HOMESTEAD CREDITS AND 33 EXEMPTIONS. Starting with the assessment year beginning 34 January 1, 2025, the bill replaces the homestead property 35 -78- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 78/ 85 S.F. 651 tax credit, other than the portion of the credit provided 1 to certain disabled veterans, with a homestead property tax 2 exemption. For assessment years beginning on or after January 3 1, 2025, the exemption amount is 25 percent of taxable value, 4 not to exceed $125,000 in taxable value. The bill specifies 5 that the elderly homestead exemption of $6,500 in taxable value 6 applies in addition to the homestead exemption established in 7 the bill. 8 The bill moves the disabled veteran homestead credit from 9 Code section 425.15 to Code section 425.1, and makes changes 10 to the scope of the disabled veteran homestead credit for new 11 applicants. Currently, a disabled veteran with a 100 percent 12 permanent and total disability rating receives a homestead 13 credit on the entire amount of tax levied on the homestead. 14 The bill specifies that a separate application form is required 15 to claim the disabled veteran homestead credit. The bill 16 does not change the homestead credit for an eligible disabled 17 veteran who makes an application for the homestead credit 18 before July 1, 2025. For a disabled veteran who makes an 19 application for the homestead credit on or after July 1, 2025, 20 the bill changes the definition of âhomesteadâ to exclude 21 appurtenances and limits the size of the homestead credit to 22 property on one-half acre. 23 The state continues to reimburse local governments for the 24 homestead credit, which for assessment years beginning on or 25 after January 1, 2025, includes only the disabled veterans 26 homestead credit, but does not reimburse local governments for 27 the homestead exemption under current law and in the bill. 28 The bill provides that homestead owners who have filed for 29 or who are receiving homestead credits or exemptions before 30 the effective date of this division of the bill shall continue 31 to receive such credits and exemptions for which the owner is 32 eligible for assessment years beginning on or after January 33 1, 2025, without refiling, and, if the owner is eligible, 34 shall receive the exemption under Code section 425.1A(1A), as 35 -79- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 79/ 85 S.F. 651 enacted in this division of the bill, without filing for such 1 exemption. 2 This division of the bill applies retroactively to 3 assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. 4 DIVISION VI ââ MILITARY SERVICE PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION. 5 Under current law, a veteran receives a property tax exemption 6 of $4,000 in taxable value on property owned by the veteran. 7 The bill increases the veterans property tax exemption from 8 $4,000 to the following exemption amounts: for the assessment 9 year beginning January 1, 2025, $5,000; for the assessment year 10 beginning January 1, 2026, $6,000; and for assessment years 11 beginning on or after January 1, 2027, $7,000. 12 The division applies retroactively to assessment years 13 beginning on or after January 1, 2025. 14 DIVISION VII ââ HOSPITAL AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES 15 PROPERTY TAX LEVIES. The bill provides that for fiscal years 16 beginning on or after July 1, 2026, any property tax levy 17 imposed for a county hospital under Code chapter 347 that 18 is limited by law to a specific property tax levy rate per 19 $1,000 of assessed value shall not exceed a levy rate per 20 $1,000 of assessed value that is equal to 1,000 multiplied by 21 the quotient obtained by dividing the product of the budget 22 adjustment factor multiplied by the current fiscal yearâs 23 actual property tax dollars certified for such levy by the 24 remainder of the total assessed value used to calculate such 25 taxes for the budget year minus value attributable to new 26 valuation. The bill defines âbudget adjustment factorâ, 27 âbudget yearâ, âcurrent fiscal yearâ, and ânew valuationâ to 28 mean the same as defined in Code section 331.423, as amended 29 in the bill. 30 The bill establishes similar limitations for levies imposed 31 under Code chapters 347A (county hospitals payable from 32 revenue), 357F (emergency medical services districts), 357G 33 (city emergency medical services districts), and 422D (optional 34 taxes for emergency medical services) that are limited by law 35 -80- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 80/ 85 S.F. 651 to a specific property tax levy rate per $1,000 of assessed 1 value. 2 DIVISION VIII ââ PROPERTY TAX LEVY RATES. The bill 3 establishes a reduction for rate-limited property tax levies. 4 The bill defines ârate-limited property tax levyâ to be any 5 ad valorem property tax levy limited by law to a specific 6 property tax levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value used to 7 calculate taxes, but does not include the school district 8 foundation levy under Code section 257.3, the county general 9 services levy under Code section 331.423(1), the county rural 10 services levy under Code section 331.423(2), the city general 11 fund levy under Code section 384.1(3), the physical plant 12 and equipment levies under Code section 298.2, the school 13 district bond tax under Code section 298.18, any levy under 14 Code chapter 28M, a levy under Code section 384.12(1)(b) levied 15 for operation and maintenance of a regional transit district, a 16 levy for the office of the assessor under Code section 441.16, 17 any levy under Code chapter 386, any levy under Code chapter 18 347 or 347A, and any levy under Code chapter 357F, 357G, or 19 422D. In addition, ârate-limited property tax levyâ does not 20 include levy rates used in the calculations under Code section 21 312.2(5)(a). 22 For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2026, each 23 rate-limited property tax levy may only be imposed if the 24 governmental entity imposed such levy for the fiscal year 25 beginning July 1, 2025, and shall, by operation of the bill, 26 be limited to a levy rate that is equal to 1,000 multiplied 27 by the quotient of 102 percent of the current fiscal yearâs 28 actual property tax dollars certified for such levy divided 29 by the total assessed value used to calculate such taxes for 30 the budget year, but not less than a levy rate per $1,000 of 31 assessed value that results in an amount of actual property tax 32 dollars certified for levy for such levy equal to 100.5 percent 33 of the actual property tax dollars certified for such levy for 34 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025. 35 -81- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 81/ 85 S.F. 651 For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2027, and each fiscal 1 year thereafter, rate-limited property tax levies may be 2 imposed by any governmental entity otherwise authorized by law, 3 regardless of whether the governmental entity imposed the levy 4 for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025, at rates not to 5 exceed those established by the general assembly by statute 6 following receipt and consideration of the report submitted by 7 the legislative interim committee requested to be established 8 by the legislative council in this division of the bill. 9 The bill also provides that, on or after July 1, 2025, a city 10 or county shall not issue bonds or other indebtedness payable 11 from an ad valorem property tax levy for the purpose of funding 12 the general operations of the city or general operations of 13 the county, as applicable, or otherwise use proceeds from the 14 sale of bonds or issuance of other indebtedness to fund general 15 operations. The bill defines âgeneral operationsâ to mean 16 services or activities generally funded from the governmental 17 entityâs general fund, which are necessary for the operation 18 of the governmental entity, including salaries and benefits, 19 or which are for the health and welfare of the governmental 20 entityâs citizens or primarily intended to benefit all 21 residents of the governmental entity, but excluding services 22 financed by statutory funds other than a debt service fund. 23 The city finance committee is required to adopt rules under 24 Code chapter 17A for cities to implement the new Code section 25 governing funding of general operations. The county finance 26 committee is required to adopt rules under Code chapter 17A for 27 counties to implement the new Code section governing funding 28 of general operations. 29 The bill updates the calculation methodologies for 30 agricultural extension levies under Code section 176A.10 and 31 reduces levy rates used to make certain calculations related to 32 the secondary road fund allocations under Code section 312.2. 33 The bill requests the legislative council to establish a 34 legislative study committee during the 2025 legislative interim 35 -82- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 82/ 85 S.F. 651 and the 2026 legislative interim to examine appropriate rates 1 of property taxation imposed by governmental entities following 2 enactment of the bill, determine an alternative methodology and 3 period of time to increase the percentage of actual value at 4 which residential and multiresidential property are subject to 5 tax from 75 percent to 100 percent, and examine the imposition 6 and administration of replacement taxes under Code chapters 7 437A and 437B. The study committee shall consist of six 8 voting members of the general assembly. Two members shall be 9 appointed by the majority leader of the senate, one member 10 appointed by the minority member of the senate, two members 11 appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives, 12 and one member appointed by the minority leader of the house 13 of representatives. The study committee is required to make 14 recommendations to the general assembly by January 15, 2027. 15 DIVISION IX ââ ELDERLY PROPERTY TAXES ââ LOW INCOME. The 16 bill modifies the eligibility for the property tax credit for 17 persons ages 70 and older under Code chapter 425, subchapter 18 II. Currently, a person filing a claim for the property tax 19 credit who is at least 70 years of age and who has a household 20 income of less than 250 percent of the federal poverty level is 21 eligible to receive a specified credit amount against property 22 taxes due on the claimantâs homestead. The bill increases the 23 household income threshold for eligibility from less than 250 24 percent of the federal poverty level to less than 300 percent 25 of the federal poverty level. 26 The division takes effect upon enactment and applies 27 retroactively to assessment years beginning on or after January 28 1, 2025. 29 DIVISION X ââ BRUCELLOSIS AND TUBERCULOSIS ERADICATION FUND 30 ââ LEVY. Code section 165.18 authorizes the secretary of 31 agriculture to direct the board of supervisors of each county 32 to levy an amount sufficient to pay the expenses estimated to 33 be incurred from the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication 34 fund for the following fiscal year, subject to a maximum levy 35 -83- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 83/ 85 S.F. 651 of 33.75 cents per $1,000.

Sale prices 18 of the property or comparable property in normal transactions 19 reflecting market value, and the probable availability 20 or unavailability of persons interested in purchasing the 21 property, shall be taken into consideration in arriving at 22 its market value. In arriving at market value, sale prices 23 of property in abnormal transactions not reflecting market 24 value shall not be taken into account, or shall be adjusted to 25 eliminate the effect of factors which distort market value, 26 including but not limited to built-to-suit construction, 27 sale-leaseback transactions, leased fee sales, sales to 28 immediate family of the seller between related parties , 29 foreclosure or other forced sales, contract sales, discounted 30 purchase transactions or purchase of adjoining land or other 31 land to be operated as a unit. 32 Sec. 54.

However, for assessment years beginning on or after 5 January 1, 2026, structures on agricultural land constructed on 6 or after January 1, 2026, that are not agricultural dwellings 7 shall not be included in determination of productivity and 8 net earning capacity of agricultural property and shall not 9 be allocated any portion of the total county productivity 10 value so determined. However, such structures shall be 11 treated similarly to agricultural structures constructed 12 before January 1, 2026, when applying any equalization 13 order of the department. Such agricultural structures shall 14 instead be valued according to the structureâs replacement 15 cost less depreciation and obsolescence and the structureâs 16 assessed value subject to taxation prior to application of any 17 assessment limitation under subsection 4 shall be equal to the 18 product of the structureâs value multiplied by the agricultural 19 factor, as determined in 701 IAC 102.3(2) or succeeding rule of 20 the department. Any formula or method employed to determine 21 productivity and net earning capacity of property shall be 22 adopted in full by rule. 23 Sec. 55. Section 441.21, subsection 2, Code 2025, is amended 24 to read as follows: 25 2. In the event market value of the property being assessed 26 cannot be readily established in the foregoing manner, then 27 the assessor may determine the value of the property using the 28 other uniform and recognized appraisal methods including its 29 productive and earning capacity, if any, industrial conditions, 30 its cost, physical and functional depreciation and obsolescence 31 and replacement cost, and all other factors which would assist 32 in determining the fair and reasonable market value of the 33 property but the actual value shall not be determined by use 34 of only one such factor. The following shall not be taken into 35 -29- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 29/ 85 S.F. 651 consideration: Special value or use value of the property to 1 its present owner, and the goodwill or value of a business 2 which uses the property as distinguished from the value of 3 the property as property. In addition, for assessment years 4 beginning on or after January 1, 2018, and unless otherwise 5 required for property valued by the department of revenue 6 pursuant to chapters 428 , 437 , and 438 , the assessor shall not 7 take into consideration and shall not request from any person 8 sales or receipts data, expense data, balance sheets, bank 9 account information, or other data related to the financial 10 condition of a business operating in whole or in part on the 11 property if the property is both classified as commercial or 12 industrial property and owned and used by the owner of the 13 business. However, in assessing property that is rented or 14 leased to low-income individuals and families as authorized by 15 section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and which 16 section limits the amount that the individual or family pays 17 for the rental or lease of units in the property, the assessor 18 shall, unless the owner elects to withdraw the property from 19 the assessment procedures for section 42 property, use the 20 productive and earning capacity from the actual rents received 21 as a method of appraisal and shall take into account the extent 22 to which that use and limitation reduces the market value of 23 the property. The assessor shall not consider any tax credit 24 equity or other subsidized financing as income provided to 25 the property in determining the assessed value. The property 26 owner shall notify the assessor when property is withdrawn 27 from section 42 eligibility under the Internal Revenue Code 28 or if the owner elects to withdraw the property from the 29 assessment procedures for section 42 property under this 30 subsection . The property shall not be subject to section 42 31 assessment procedures for the assessment year for which section 32 42 eligibility is withdrawn or an election is made. This 33 notification must be provided to the assessor no later than 34 March 1 of the assessment year or the owner will be subject to a 35 -30- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 30/ 85 S.F. 651 penalty of five hundred dollars for that assessment year. The 1 penalty shall be collected at the same time and in the same 2 manner as regular property taxes. An election to withdraw 3 from the assessment procedures for section 42 property is 4 irrevocable. Property that is withdrawn from the assessment 5 procedures for section 42 property shall be classified and 6 assessed as residential multiresidential property unless the 7 property otherwise fails to meet the requirements of subsection 8 14 13 . Upon adoption of uniform rules by the department of 9 revenue or succeeding authority covering assessments and 10 valuations of such properties, the valuation on such properties 11 shall be determined in accordance with such rules and in 12 accordance with forms and guidelines contained in the real 13 property appraisal manual prepared by the department as updated 14 from time to time for assessment purposes to assure uniformity, 15 but such rules, forms, and guidelines shall not be inconsistent 16 with or change the foregoing means of determining the actual, 17 market, taxable, and assessed values. 18 Sec. 56.

The commission, with the approval of the board of 8 supervisors of participating counties and the city council 9 of participating cities in the chapter 28E agreement, may , 10 subject to paragraph âbâ , levy annually a tax not to exceed 11 ninety-five eighty cents per thousand dollars of the assessed 12 value of all taxable property in a regional transit district 13 to the extent provided in this section . The chapter 28E 14 agreement may authorize the commission to levy the tax at 15 different rates within the participating cities and counties in 16 amounts sufficient to meet the revenue responsibilities of such 17 cities and counties as allocated in the budget adopted by the 18 commission. However, for a city participating in a regional 19 transit district, the total of all the tax levies imposed in 20 the city pursuant to section 384.12, subsection 1 , paragraph 21 âbâ , and this section shall not exceed the aggregate of 22 ninety-five eighty cents per thousand dollars of the assessed 23 value of all taxable property in the participating city. 24 b.

EFFECTIVE DATE. This division of this Act takes 15 effect January 1, 2026. 16 Sec. 115. APPLICABILITY. This division of this Act applies 17 to property taxes due and payable in fiscal years beginning on 18 or after July 1, 2026. 19 EXPLANATION 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 21 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 22 This bill relates to local government property taxes, 23 financial authority, and budgets. 24 DIVISION I ââ COUNTY PROPERTY TAXES AND BUDGETS. Code 25 section 331.423 establishes a levy rate limitation for the 26 general county services levy and a limitation for the rural 27 county services levy. The bill modifies the general county 28 services levy rate limitation for the fiscal year beginning 29 July 1, 2026, to be a levy rate not to exceed the greater of: 30 (1) a levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value equal to 1,000 31 multiplied by the quotient of 102 percent of the current fiscal 32 yearâs (immediately preceding fiscal year) actual property tax 33 dollars certified for levy for general county services divided 34 by the remainder of the total assessed value used to calculate 35 -70- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 70/ 85 S.F. 651 such taxes for the budget year minus value attributable to new 1 valuation, as defined in the bill; and (2) a levy rate per 2 $1,000 of assessed value that results in an amount of actual 3 property tax dollars certified for levy for general county 4 services equal to 100.5 percent of the actual property tax 5 dollars certified for such levy for the current fiscal year. 6 For each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2027, 7 the maximum levy rate is the levy rate imposed by the county 8 for the current fiscal year unless the total assessed value, 9 excluding new valuation, used to calculate taxes for general 10 county services for the budget year is equal to or exceeds 102 11 percent of the total assessed value used to calculate taxes for 12 general county services for the current fiscal year, and for 13 the budget year beginning July 1, 2027, only, not less than 14 a levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value that results in an 15 amount of actual property tax dollars certified for levy equal 16 to 100.5 percent of the actual property tax dollars certified 17 for levy for the current fiscal year. 18 If the total assessed value, excluding value attributable 19 to new valuation, used to calculate taxes for general county 20 services for the budget year is equal to or exceeds 102 percent 21 of the total assessed value used to calculate taxes for general 22 county services for the current fiscal year, the levy rate 23 imposed shall not exceed a levy rate per $1,000 of assessed 24 value that is equal to 1,000 multiplied by the quotient 25 obtained by dividing the product of the budget adjustment 26 factor, as defined in the bill and which ranges from 102 27 percent to 105 percent depending upon the amount of annual 28 increase in the consumer price index, multiplied by the current 29 fiscal yearâs actual property tax dollars certified for levy 30 by the remainder of the total assessed value used to calculate 31 such taxes for the budget year minus value attributable to new 32 valuation. 33 The bill similarly modifies the maximum levy rate for rural 34 county services for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 35 -71- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 71/ 85 S.F. 651 2026. 1 The division takes effect January 1, 2026, and applies to 2 county taxes and budgets for fiscal years beginning on or after 3 July 1, 2026. 4 DIVISION II ââ CITY PROPERTY TAXES AND BUDGETS. Code 5 section 384.1 establishes the city general fund levy and limits 6 on the levy rate. The bill modifies the general fund levy 7 rate limitation for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2026, 8 to be a levy rate not to exceed the greater of: (1) a levy 9 rate per $1,000 of assessed value equal to 1,000 multiplied 10 by the quotient of 102 percent of the current fiscal yearâs 11 (immediately preceding fiscal year) actual property tax dollars 12 certified for levy divided by the remainder of the total 13 assessed value used to calculate such taxes for the budget year 14 minus value attributable to new valuation, as defined in the 15 bill; and (2) a levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value that 16 results in an amount of actual property tax dollars certified 17 for levy equal to 100.5 percent of the actual property tax 18 dollars certified for such levy for the current fiscal year. 19 For each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2027, the 20 maximum levy rate is the levy rate imposed by the city for the 21 current fiscal year unless the total assessed value, excluding 22 new valuation, used to calculate taxes for the budget year is 23 equal to or exceeds 102 percent of the total assessed value 24 used to calculate taxes for the current fiscal year, and for 25 the budget year beginning July 1, 2027, only, not less than 26 a levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value that results in an 27 amount of actual property tax dollars certified for levy equal 28 to 100.5 percent of the actual property tax dollars certified 29 for levy for the current fiscal year. 30 If the total assessed value, excluding value attributable 31 to new valuation, used to calculate taxes for the city general 32 fund for the budget year is equal to or exceeds 102 percent 33 of the total assessed value used to calculate taxes for the 34 current fiscal year, the levy rate imposed shall not exceed a 35 -72- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 72/ 85 S.F. 651 levy rate per $1,000 of assessed value that is equal to 1,000 1 multiplied by the quotient obtained by dividing the product 2 of the budget adjustment factor, as defined in the bill and 3 which ranges from 102 percent to 105 percent depending upon 4 the amount of annual increase in the consumer price index, 5 multiplied by the current fiscal yearâs actual property tax 6 dollars certified for levy by the remainder of the total 7 assessed value used to calculate such taxes for the budget year 8 minus value attributable to new valuation. 9 The bill also establishes a methodology to determine a 10 maximum levy rate for a city that is not imposing a general 11 fund levy in the current fiscal year. 12 The division takes effect January 1, 2026, and applies to 13 property taxes and budgets for fiscal years beginning on or 14 after July 1, 2026. 15 DIVISION III ââ SCHOOL TAXES AND BUDGETS. As part of 16 the state school foundation program, for school budget 17 years beginning on or after July 1, 2022, Code section 257.1 18 establishes the regular program foundation base to be 88.4 19 percent of the regular program state cost per pupil. Beginning 20 with the budget year beginning July 1, 2026, the bill increases 21 that percentage to 100 percent. Similarly, the bill increases 22 the special education support services foundation base 23 percentage from 79 percent to 100 percent. 24 Code section 257.3 requires school districts to levy a 25 foundation property tax of $5.40 per $1,000 of assessed value 26 on all taxable property in the school district. The bill 27 reduces the foundation property tax levy rate to $4.48662 per 28 $1,000 of assessed value for budget years beginning on or after 29 July 1, 2026. 30 Code section 257.3 provides an exception to the foundation 31 property tax levy rate of $5.40 for those school districts that 32 have recently been reorganized. Such districts are provided 33 reduced foundation property tax levy rates for three years 34 following the reorganization. The bill adjusts those reduced 35 -73- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 73/ 85 S.F. 651 rates for reorganizations that take effect on or after July 1 1, 2026, to reflect the reduction made in the bill to the 2 foundation property tax levy imposed by school districts that 3 are not subject to a reorganization and eliminates certain 4 supplemental aid related to such reorganized school district 5 rates for budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2026. 6 The bill eliminates certain property tax adjustment aid 7 under Code section 257.15(2) and (3) for fiscal years beginning 8 on or after July 1, 2026. 9 The bill eliminates the $24 million general fund 10 appropriation for adjusted additional property tax levy aid 11 under Code section 257.15(4) for fiscal years beginning on 12 or after July 1, 2026. The bill also eliminates the annual 13 appropriation of the balance of the property tax equity and 14 relief fund under Code section 257.16A for purposes designated 15 under Code section 257.15(4) and requires remaining moneys at 16 the end of a specified fiscal year to be transferred back to 17 the funds from which they were received. 18 The bill eliminates the payment of school district property 19 tax replacement payments for fiscal years beginning on or after 20 July 1, 2026. 21 The bill eliminates the annual appropriation of moneys in 22 the foundation base supplement fund for fiscal years beginning 23 on or after July 1, 2026, and requires the remaining moneys 24 at the end of a specified fiscal year to be transferred for 25 deposit in the secure an advanced vision for education fund. 26 The bill eliminates transfers from the secure an advanced 27 vision for education fund to the property tax equity and relief 28 fund and the foundation base supplement fund for fiscal years 29 beginning on or after July 1, 2026, and instead provides that 30 such amounts shall be credited to the state general fund to be 31 used for increased foundation aid resulting from the increase 32 in the regular program foundation base per pupil to 100 percent 33 of the regular program state cost per pupil. 34 In Code chapters 425A (family farm tax credit) and 426 35 -74- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 74/ 85 S.F. 651 (agricultural land tax credit), the bill replaces references 1 to the school foundation property tax levy rate ($5.40) with 2 citations to the appropriate provision of the Code section 3 establishing the foundation property tax rate. 4 The bill requires each school district with an unexpended 5 fund balance in the districtâs management levy fund under 6 Code section 298A.3 at the conclusion of the fiscal year 7 beginning July 1, 2024, that exceeds an amount equal to the 8 total expenditures from the districtâs management fund for the 9 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024, to certify such unexpended 10 fund balance and expenditure amounts, including any reserved 11 or designated amounts in the fund and the purposes therefor, 12 to the school budget review committee by November 15, 2025. 13 The committee is then required to conduct a review of the 14 unexpended fund balances and expenditures of school district 15 management levy funds certified under the bill. By February 16 1, 2026, the committee shall make recommendations to the 17 general assembly for establishing district management levy fund 18 unexpended fund balance limitations for fiscal years beginning 19 on or after July 1, 2027, including recommendations for 20 limitations based on a percentage of the districtâs management 21 levy fund expenditures and recommendations for management levy 22 limitations and expenditure requirements for excess funds. 23 The bill amends several provisions relating to the state 24 school foundation program funding formula to include funding 25 for the media services funding and educational services funding 26 under Code section 257.37 to be included and funded as part of 27 foundation aid paid by the state instead of funding through a 28 school districtâs additional property tax under Code section 29 257.4 for school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 30 2026. 31 The bill reduces by approximately 70 percent the maximum 32 levy rates for the regular and voter-approved physical plant 33 and equipment levy under Code section 298.2 and the school 34 district bond tax under Code section 298.18. The bill also 35 -75- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 75/ 85 S.F. 651 repeals an obsolete provision relating to levy adjustments 1 authorized to occur before June 30, 2007, in Code section 2 298.18A. 3 The bill also amends Code section 298.4 by providing that for 4 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2027, if a school 5 districtâs unexpended fund balance of the districtâs management 6 levy fund is equal to or exceeds a specified percentage of the 7 average annual expenditures from the districtâs management 8 levy fund for the three consecutive fiscal years immediately 9 preceding the base year, the board of directors may not certify 10 a district management levy for the fiscal year. Additionally, 11 if a school district is not prohibited from certifying a levy 12 under the bill, the maximum amount that the board of directors 13 may certify for levy under the district management levy shall 14 be an amount equal to the remainder of a specified percentage 15 of the average annual expenditures from the districtâs 16 management levy fund for the three consecutive fiscal years 17 immediately preceding the base year minus the districtâs 18 management levy fund unexpended fund balance for the fiscal 19 year preceding the base year. 20 Except for the section of the division amending Code section 21 257.31, which relates to the school budget review committee, 22 this division of the bill takes effect January 1, 2026, and 23 applies to fiscal years and school budget years beginning on 24 or after July 1, 2026. 25 DIVISION IV ââ PROPERTY VALUATIONS AND ASSESSMENT 26 LIMITATIONS. Code section 441.21 provides that the actual 27 value of agricultural property shall be determined on the 28 basis of productivity and net earning capacity and that any 29 formula or method employed to determine productivity and net 30 earning capacity of property shall be adopted in full by rule 31 of the department of revenue. The bill amends that provision 32 by specifying that for assessment years beginning on or after 33 January 1, 2026, structures on agricultural land constructed on 34 or after January 1, 2026, that are not agricultural dwellings 35 -76- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 76/ 85 S.F. 651 shall not be included in determination of productivity and 1 net earning capacity of agricultural property and shall not 2 be allocated any portion of the total county productivity 3 value so determined. Such agricultural structures shall 4 instead be valued according to the structureâs replacement 5 cost less depreciation and obsolescence and the structureâs 6 assessed value subject to taxation prior to application of 7 any assessment limitation shall be equal to the product of 8 the structureâs value multiplied by the agricultural factor, 9 as determined in 701 IAC 102.3(2) or succeeding rule of the 10 department. The bill also provides that such structures shall 11 be treated similarly to agricultural structures constructed 12 before January 1, 2026, when applying any equalization order 13 of the department of revenue. 14 The bill modifies the list of examples of abnormal property 15 transactions that are to be excluded from consideration or 16 adjusted to eliminate distortions of market value when valuing 17 property to include built-to-suit construction, sale-leaseback 18 transactions, leased fee sales, and instead of sales to 19 immediate family, sales between related parties. 20 Code section 441.21(4) establishes the calculation for 21 assessment limitations (rollback) for residential property and 22 agricultural property. The bill strikes the calculation of 23 the residential property assessment limitation for assessment 24 years beginning on or after January 1, 2025, and strikes 25 the provision within the agricultural property assessment 26 limitation calculation that limits growth of residential or 27 agricultural property to the growth in the other classification 28 (ag-residential tie). The bill provides that residential 29 property is assessed at 75 percent of the propertyâs actual 30 value for assessment years beginning January 1, 2025, and 31 January 1, 2026. The bill then increases the percentage of 32 actual value at which residential property is assessed by 2.5 33 percent each assessment year until the percentage reaches 100 34 percent for assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 35 -77- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 77/ 85 S.F. 651 2036. By operation of law and through changes in the bill, 1 all other classifications of property, except for agricultural 2 property, residential property, and multiresidential property, 3 are assessed at 100 percent of actual value for assessment 4 years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. 5 The bill modifies provisions governing the calculation 6 of payments made to local governments under Code section 7 441.21(5)(e) that are made to replace property taxes due to the 8 application of the residential property assessment limitation 9 to certain portions of commercial and industrial property 10 valuations and eliminates the appropriation for such payments 11 for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2026, due to 12 elimination of the assessment limitations. 13 The bill also reestablishes a multiresidential property 14 classification for assessment years beginning on or after 15 January 1, 2026, that includes types of property that were 16 classified as multiresidential property for assessment years 17 beginning before January 1, 2022. Such property is included 18 within the residential property classification under current 19 law. Under the bill, for purposes of equalization under Code 20 sections 441.47 through 441.49, multiresidential property shall 21 be considered residential property. The bill provides that 22 multiresidential property is assessed at 75 percent of actual 23 value for the assessment year beginning January 1, 2026. The 24 bill then increases the percentage of actual value at which 25 multiresidential property is assessed by 2.5 percent each 26 assessment year until the percentage reaches 100 percent for 27 assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2036. 28 Except for provisions relating to the reestablishment of the 29 multiresidential property classification, this division of the 30 bill applies retroactively to assessment years beginning on or 31 after January 1, 2025. 32 DIVISION V ââ DISABLED VETERAN AND HOMESTEAD CREDITS AND 33 EXEMPTIONS. Starting with the assessment year beginning 34 January 1, 2025, the bill replaces the homestead property 35 -78- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 78/ 85 S.F. 651 tax credit, other than the portion of the credit provided 1 to certain disabled veterans, with a homestead property tax 2 exemption. For assessment years beginning on or after January 3 1, 2025, the exemption amount is 25 percent of taxable value, 4 not to exceed $125,000 in taxable value. The bill specifies 5 that the elderly homestead exemption of $6,500 in taxable value 6 applies in addition to the homestead exemption established in 7 the bill. 8 The bill moves the disabled veteran homestead credit from 9 Code section 425.15 to Code section 425.1, and makes changes 10 to the scope of the disabled veteran homestead credit for new 11 applicants. Currently, a disabled veteran with a 100 percent 12 permanent and total disability rating receives a homestead 13 credit on the entire amount of tax levied on the homestead. 14 The bill specifies that a separate application form is required 15 to claim the disabled veteran homestead credit. The bill 16 does not change the homestead credit for an eligible disabled 17 veteran who makes an application for the homestead credit 18 before July 1, 2025. For a disabled veteran who makes an 19 application for the homestead credit on or after July 1, 2025, 20 the bill changes the definition of âhomesteadâ to exclude 21 appurtenances and limits the size of the homestead credit to 22 property on one-half acre. 23 The state continues to reimburse local governments for the 24 homestead credit, which for assessment years beginning on or 25 after January 1, 2025, includes only the disabled veterans 26 homestead credit, but does not reimburse local governments for 27 the homestead exemption under current law and in the bill. 28 The bill provides that homestead owners who have filed for 29 or who are receiving homestead credits or exemptions before 30 the effective date of this division of the bill shall continue 31 to receive such credits and exemptions for which the owner is 32 eligible for assessment years beginning on or after January 33 1, 2025, without refiling, and, if the owner is eligible, 34 shall receive the exemption under Code section 425.1A(1A), as 35 -79- LSB 2982SV (2) 91 jm/md 79/ 85 S.F. 651 enacted in this division of the bill, without filing for such 1 exemption. 2 This division of the bill applies retroactively to 3 assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. 4 DIVISION VI ââ MILITARY SERVICE PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION. 5 Under current law, a veteran receives a property tax exemption 6 of $4,000 in taxable value on property owned by the veteran. 7 The bill increases the veterans property tax exemption from 8 $4,000 to the following exemption amounts: for the assessment 9 year beginning January 1, 2025, $5,000; for the assessment year 10 beginning January 1, 2026, $6,000; and for assessment years 11 beginning on or after January 1, 2027, $7,000. 12 The division applies retroactively to assessment years 13 beginning on or after January 1, 2025. 14 DIVISION VII ââ HOSPITAL AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES 15 PROPERTY TAX LEVIES.
