The agreement 15 must contain a notice to the smart deviceâs user that the 16 smart device has AI installed on the smart device; if the 17 smart deviceâs AI is designed to access the userâs private 18 data, the smart deviceâs statement of purpose (SOP); and an 19 option to uninstall the AI. If the smart deviceâs user does 20 not uninstall the AI, the device company needs to cause an 21 interactive form to appear that will allow the smart deviceâs 22 user to refuse the smart deviceâs AI access to each type of 23 private data the AI is designed to access on the smart device 24 prior to the AI accessing the private data. The agreement must 25 be separate from any other agreement or disclaimer the device 26 company requires or is required to create for the smart device, 27 including but not limited to terms of service agreements and 28 end user license agreements. 29 If a device company changes any information contained in the 30 SOP for a smart device, the bill requires the device company 31 to update the agreement containing the smart deviceâs SOP, and 32 cause the updated agreement to appear on each smart device 33 affected by the change and which has not authorized or refused 34 access to private data based on the change. 35 -8- LSB 1732YH (3) 91 dg/jh 8/ 10 H.F. 406 If a device company causes AI to be installed on a smart 1 device the device company manufactured, the bill prohibits 2 the device company from permitting the AI installed on the 3 smart device to access a type of private data that the AI was 4 not authorized to access in an agreement containing the smart 5 deviceâs SOP; using private data accessed by the AI in a manner 6 that is not stated in the smart deviceâs SOP; if the AI saves, 7 copies, or otherwise transfers private data to a location 8 outside a smart device from which the private data originated, 9 maintaining, disseminating, or deleting the private data in a 10 manner that is inconsistent with the smart deviceâs SOP. 11 The bill contains provisions for an app developer which 12 are similar to the requirements and prohibitions for a device 13 company if the app developer makes an app that includes AI 14 available for general use and the app is designed to access 15 private data. 16 The bill prohibits a device company from requiring a smart 17 device user to install AI on the smart device as a condition to 18 use the smart device. 19 The bill requires a device company to include clearly 20 identifiable means to allow a user to uninstall artificial 21 intelligence from a smart device if the artificial intelligence 22 was installed on the smart device due to an action taken by the 23 device company. 24 The bill prohibits a person from using AI to intentionally 25 recreate the audio or visual likeness of an individual without 26 the consent of the individual if the likeness was intended to 27 be substantially indistinguishable from the individual and the 28 likeness is used in commercial activity; a political campaign 29 which the individual does not support; a manner intended to 30 make other persons believe that the individual engages in 31 activities the individual would reasonably find offensive; 32 a manner intended to diminish the individualâs credibility, 33 cause embarrassment, or otherwise lower the individualâs esteem 34 within the individualâs community; or a manner intended to 35 -9- LSB 1732YH (3) 91 dg/jh 9/ 10 H.F. 406 induce a person to take an action or divulge information the 1 person otherwise would not. 2 The bill allows a person to bring an action for actual 3 damages and punitive damages for a violation of the bill, plus 4 reasonable attorney fees and costs. Punitive damages cannot 5 exceed $250,000 per violation. 6 The bill allows persons to bring class actions in accordance 7 with the Iowa rules of civil procedure for violations of the 8 bill. 9 The bill requires the court to specify the amount of actual 10 damages, punitive damages, court costs, and reasonable attorney 11 fees for each violation of the new Code chapter. The bill 12 lists several factors a court must consider when determining 13 the amount of punitive damages under the new Code chapter. 14 A device company is considered to have committed a separate 15 violation for each smart device manufactured on or after July 16 1, 2025, that is initialized in this state. A developer is 17 considered to have committed a separate violation for each 18 smart device that uses the developerâs AI or app on or after 19 July 1, 2025, in this state. A person is considered to have 20 committed a separate violation for each day a likeness is used 21 in violation of the bill. 22 The bill does not preclude a person from bringing an action 23 under any other provision of law. 24 -10- LSB 1732YH (3) 91 dg/jh 10/ 10
