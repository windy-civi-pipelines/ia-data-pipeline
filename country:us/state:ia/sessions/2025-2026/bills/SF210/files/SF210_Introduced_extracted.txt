Prior to issuing a license to practice a 17 health profession, the bill requires a health profession 18 licensing board to consult the national practitioner data bank, 19 the child abuse registry, and the sex offender registry for 20 any information that would constitute grounds to decline to 21 issue a license to an applicant. The bill also requires the 22 department of inspections, appeals, and licensing to create 23 an integrated database by July 1, 2026, that contains all 24 information found in the national practitioner data bank and 25 all state disciplinary records and actions, which shall be 26 available to the public at no cost. The bill requires the 27 integrated database to include a clearly identifiable function 28 that identifies whether each licensee has had a complaint filed 29 against the licensee for sexual misconduct or sexual assault, 30 as defined in the bill, substance use, medical malpractice, 31 or substandard practice. Upon the creation of the integrated 32 database, the bill requires a health profession licensing 33 board to consult the database before issuing a license to an 34 applicant. 35 -6- LSB 2056XS (2) 91 ss/ko 6/ 9 S.F. 210 If a health profession licensing board identifies a founded 1 case of sexual misconduct against an applicant, the bill 2 prohibits the board from issuing a license to the applicant 3 unless 10 years have elapsed since the conduct giving rise 4 to the case, and the applicant has completed a problematic 5 sexualized behavior treatment program. If a health profession 6 licensing board identifies a founded case of sexual misconduct 7 against a current licensee, the bill requires the board to 8 suspend the license of the licensee until 10 years have elapsed 9 since the conduct giving rise to the case, and the licensee has 10 completed a problematic sexualized behavior treatment program. 11 The bill imposes on licensees a duty to report any other 12 licensee that the licensee knows to have violated a law or rule 13 regarding sexual misconduct, sexual assault, or substance use 14 within five days of obtaining such knowledge to the relevant 15 board. The bill requires each health profession licensing 16 board to require each licensee to complete at least one hour 17 of continuing education per licensure renewal cycle on the 18 licenseeâs duty to report. 19 The bill requires a person who employs a licensed health 20 professional to submit to the board who licenses the person 21 information regarding all disciplinary actions taken against 22 the licensee. Upon the receipt of a complaint against a 23 licensee, the bill also requires a board to provide a copy 24 of the complaint to the licenseeâs employer, all insurance 25 carriers who have billed for the licenseeâs services in the 26 past year, and the licenseeâs medical malpractice insurance 27 company, if applicable, if the board receives the express 28 written permission of the complainant. 29 The bill requires health profession licensing boards to take 30 certain actions in response to the receipt of complaints on 31 specified matters. For a complaint of sexual misconduct, a 32 board shall require a licensee to practice under supervision 33 until the conclusion of the boardâs investigation. For a 34 complaint of sexual assault, the board shall suspend the 35 -7- LSB 2056XS (2) 91 ss/ko 7/ 9 S.F. 210 license of the licensee until the conclusion of the boardâs 1 investigation. The bill requires health profession licensing 2 boards to prioritize investigations of complaints of sexual 3 misconduct and sexual assault such that the average length of 4 such investigations does not exceed 30 days. If a licensee is 5 criminally charged with sexual abuse or human trafficking, a 6 health profession licensing board shall immediately suspend the 7 license of the licensee, and a board shall permanently revoke 8 the license of a licensee who is convicted of sexual abuse 9 or human trafficking. The bill requires a law enforcement 10 officer to provide all information gathered pursuant to an 11 investigation of a claim of sexual abuse or human trafficking 12 against a licensee to the relevant licensing board if the 13 law enforcement officer terminates the investigation without 14 requesting that charges be filed, charges are dropped, or a 15 conviction is overturned. The board shall then permanently 16 revoke the license of a licensee if the board finds by a 17 preponderance of the evidence that the underlying conduct 18 occurred. 19 The bill requires a licensed health professional who 20 is practicing on a probationary basis to provide a written 21 disclosure regarding the basis for the licenseeâs probationary 22 status to a person or the personâs guardian prior to providing 23 services. 24 Prior to granting a license to an applicant for a license 25 to practice medicine and surgery or osteopathic medicine and 26 surgery who has practiced in another state, the bill requires 27 the board of medicine to obtain the complete disciplinary 28 history of the applicant from each state in which the applicant 29 has practiced and determine whether the history requires the 30 board to decline to issue a license or complete an additional 31 investigation before issuing a license. The bill allows the 32 board of medicine to discipline a physician and surgeon or 33 osteopathic physician and surgeon who is employed by a health 34 insurer and denies a claim for any reason not supported by the 35 -8- LSB 2056XS (2) 91 ss/ko 8/ 9 S.F. 210 sound medical judgment of the licensee. 1 The bill removes the privileged and confidential status of 2 files relating to a licensing board investigation of a licensee 3 once the licensing board completes its investigation. The bill 4 prohibits a licensing board from releasing investigative files 5 containing personally identifiable information without the 6 express written consent of the complainant. 7 The bill makes disciplinary records of a licensed health 8 professional admissible in a civil action to the extent that 9 they show a pattern of misconduct or a breach of professional 10 duties. 11 -9- LSB 2056XS (2) 91 ss/ko 9/ 9

For a 34 complaint of sexual assault, the board shall suspend the 35 -7- LSB 2056XS (2) 91 ss/ko 7/ 9 S.F. 210 license of the licensee until the conclusion of the boardâs 1 investigation. The bill requires health profession licensing 2 boards to prioritize investigations of complaints of sexual 3 misconduct and sexual assault such that the average length of 4 such investigations does not exceed 30 days. If a licensee is 5 criminally charged with sexual abuse or human trafficking, a 6 health profession licensing board shall immediately suspend the 7 license of the licensee, and a board shall permanently revoke 8 the license of a licensee who is convicted of sexual abuse 9 or human trafficking. The bill requires a law enforcement 10 officer to provide all information gathered pursuant to an 11 investigation of a claim of sexual abuse or human trafficking 12 against a licensee to the relevant licensing board if the 13 law enforcement officer terminates the investigation without 14 requesting that charges be filed, charges are dropped, or a 15 conviction is overturned. The board shall then permanently 16 revoke the license of a licensee if the board finds by a 17 preponderance of the evidence that the underlying conduct 18 occurred. 19 The bill requires a licensed health professional who 20 is practicing on a probationary basis to provide a written 21 disclosure regarding the basis for the licenseeâs probationary 22 status to a person or the personâs guardian prior to providing 23 services. 24 Prior to granting a license to an applicant for a license 25 to practice medicine and surgery or osteopathic medicine and 26 surgery who has practiced in another state, the bill requires 27 the board of medicine to obtain the complete disciplinary 28 history of the applicant from each state in which the applicant 29 has practiced and determine whether the history requires the 30 board to decline to issue a license or complete an additional 31 investigation before issuing a license. The bill allows the 32 board of medicine to discipline a physician and surgeon or 33 osteopathic physician and surgeon who is employed by a health 34 insurer and denies a claim for any reason not supported by the 35 -8- LSB 2056XS (2) 91 ss/ko 8/ 9 S.F. 210 sound medical judgment of the licensee. 1 The bill removes the privileged and confidential status of 2 files relating to a licensing board investigation of a licensee 3 once the licensing board completes its investigation. The bill 4 prohibits a licensing board from releasing investigative files 5 containing personally identifiable information without the 6 express written consent of the complainant. 7 The bill makes disciplinary records of a licensed health 8 professional admissible in a civil action to the extent that 9 they show a pattern of misconduct or a breach of professional 10 duties. 11 -9- LSB 2056XS (2) 91 ss/ko 9/ 9
