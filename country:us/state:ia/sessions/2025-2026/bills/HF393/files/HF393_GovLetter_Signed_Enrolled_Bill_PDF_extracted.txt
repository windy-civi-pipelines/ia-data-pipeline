AFFECT SCHOOL PERFORMANCE GRADES CONTAINED IN THE PROFILES.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF IOWA:

Section 2:
Section 1. 2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 121, section 73,
subsection 2, is amended to read as follows:

Section 3:
2. The department shall develop an achievement score that
calculates aggregate growth as well as aggregate proficiency
of students which when combined with other academic indicators
results in an overall school performance grade for each
attendance center in the school district. For purposes of
calculating the performance grade, if a student returns to
the school after dropping out and subsequently drops out
again, the student's second or subsequent dropping out of
school shall not adversely affect the school's performance
grade. The performance grade may also be used as one measure
to rank and classify schools into six different performance
categories: exceptional, high performing, commendable,
acceptable, needs improvement, and priority. The categories
may be used to define support and specialized assistance to
schools classified as needs improvement or priority as well as
to recognize schools designated exceptional or high performing.
Additionally, a closing gap score shall be calculated as
another measure to determine subgroup performance and to rank
and classify attendance centers. Other academic indicators
House File 393, p. 2
shall be defined as criterion referenced variables that will
be utilized in the calculation of the performance grade.
Other academic indicators shall include but not be limited
to graduation rates, attendance rates, and college-readiness
rates. Additional indicators of academic success and progress
may include post-graduation data, suspension and expulsion
rates, levels of student engagement, parent satisfaction,
parent engagement, and staff working conditions.
