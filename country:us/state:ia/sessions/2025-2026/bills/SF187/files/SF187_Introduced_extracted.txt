The bill provides that an employer has an 19 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a 20 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other 21 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited 22 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or 23 experience. However, this affirmative defense shall only 24 apply if the employer demonstrates that the factor is not 25 based on or derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is 26 job related with respect to the position in question, and 27 is consistent with a business necessity. The bill defines 28 âbusiness necessityâ as an overriding legitimate business 29 purpose such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills 30 the business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative 31 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an 32 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same 33 business purpose without producing the wage differential. 34 The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under 35 -4- LSB 1528XS (5) 91 je/js 4/ 5 S.F. 187 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of 1 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is 2 the subject of the claim. 3 -5- LSB 1528XS (5) 91 je/js 5/ 5
