The dollar value of 13 the loss is the outstanding balance on the validated claim at 14 the time of payment the claimant is indemnified from the fund. 15 8. Payment Indemnification of claims claimant . 16 a. Upon a determination by the board that the claim is 17 an eligible for payment claim satisfies the requirements in 18 subsection 4 , the board shall provide for payment of ninety 19 percent of the loss, as determined under indemnify the claimant 20 as a depositor under subsection 5 , but not more than three 21 hundred thousand dollars per claimant and a seller under 22 subsection 6 . Upon a determination by the board that an 23 eligible repayment claim filed by that seller under section 24 203D.6A derives from the same covered transaction during the 25 claim period, and the repayment loss incurred for that claim, 26 the board shall indemnify the claimant as a seller subject to 27 the requirements of this section and section 203D.6A. 28 b. Subject to the indemnification limit described in 29 paragraph âcâ , the board shall indemnify a claimant ninety 30 percent of the combined dollar value losses, including any 31 repayment loss, incurred by the claimant as described in 32 paragraph âaâ , except for a segregated dollar value loss 33 incurred from the sale of grain under a credit-sale contract. 34 The board shall indemnify the seller seventy percent of the 35 -16- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 16/ 31 H.F. 999 dollar value loss incurred from the sale of grain under a 1 deferred-pricing contract and zero percent of the dollar 2 value loss for the sale of grain under a deferred-payment 3 contract. The full indemnity amount paid to a claimant shall 4 be calculated as the sum of the following: 5 (1) Ninety cents for each dollar value loss, including any 6 repayment loss, incurred by the claimant other than a dollar 7 value loss for the sale of grain under a credit-sale contract. 8 (2) For the sale of grain under a credit-sale contract, all 9 of the following: 10 (a) Seventy cents for each dollar value loss incurred by the 11 claimant other than a dollar value loss for the sale of grain 12 under a deferred-pricing contract. 13 (b) Zero cents for each dollar value loss incurred by the 14 claimant under a deferred-payment contract. 15 c. The board shall not indemnify any claimant for more than 16 three hundred thousand dollars for an eligible claim for all 17 dollar value losses described in paragraphs âaâ and âbâ that are 18 part of the same covered transaction during the indemnity claim 19 period. 20 d. (1) If at any time the board determines that there 21 are insufficient funds moneys in the fund to make payment of 22 fully indemnify all eligible claims, the board may shall order 23 that payment be deferred on specified claims. The department, 24 upon the boardâs instruction, shall hold those claims for 25 payment until the board determines that the fund again contains 26 sufficient assets the eligible claims be indemnified according 27 to the following order: 28 (a) First, by indemnifying all claims for dollar value 29 losses other than segregated dollar value losses arising from 30 the sale of grain under credit-sale contract as provided in 31 subsection 4 . 32 (b) Second, by indemnifying all claims for segregated 33 dollar value losses arising from the sale of grain under a 34 deferred-pricing contract as provided in subsection 4. 35 -17- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 17/ 31 H.F. 999 (2) The board may establish one or more eligible claim 1 indemnification periods required to fully indemnify all 2 eligible claims. The department shall hold those claims that 3 have not been fully indemnified until a later period or periods 4 for the full indemnification of those claims as moneys in the 5 fund are available. 6 9. Subrogation of fund. In the event of payment the 7 indemnification of a dollar value loss under this section , 8 the fund is subrogated to the extent of the amount of any 9 payments to all rights, powers, privileges, and remedies of the 10 depositor or seller against any person regarding the dollar 11 value loss. The depositor or seller shall render all necessary 12 assistance to aid the department and the board in securing 13 the rights granted in this section . No An action or claim 14 initiated by a depositor or seller and pending at the time of 15 payment indemnification from the fund shall not be compromised 16 or settled without the consent of the board. 17 Sec. 18. Section 203D.6, subsection 10, paragraph b, Code 18 2025, is amended to read as follows: 19 b. The fund shall not be liable for the payment 20 indemnification of an expired claim. 21 Sec. 19. NEW SECTION . 203D.6A Indemnification of repayment 22 loss against fund. 23 1. A separate process is established to provide for 24 indemnification of a repayment loss incurred by a seller 25 against a grain dealer who is a debtor in bankruptcy under the 26 protections provided in Tit. 11 of the United States Code. 27 a. A repayment claim that includes the repayment loss shall 28 be filed with the department in the manner prescribed by the 29 department. 30 b. A seller may file an eligible claim for a dollar value 31 loss under section 203D.6 and an eligible repayment claim for a 32 repayment loss under this section. 33 c. The department may consolidate a repayment claim filed 34 under this subsection with a claim filed by the same claimant 35 -18- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 18/ 31 H.F. 999 that is part of the same covered transaction under the claim 1 period as provided in section 203D.6. 2 2. To be timely, a seller must file a repayment claim with 3 the department not later than sixty days after the repayment 4 claimâs dollar value loss is finalized by a bankruptcy court, 5 whether by an order issued, judgment entered, or settlement 6 agreement approved. 7 3. The department may provide notice of the repayment claim 8 process to a seller that may become or has become subject to 9 an order issued, judgment entered, or settlement agreement 10 approved by a bankruptcy court that requires the seller to 11 pay back amounts previously received for grain purchased by a 12 licensed grain dealer, in the bankruptcy of the grain dealer. 13 If the department chooses to provide a notice to the seller, it 14 shall have discretion to determine any reasonable method and 15 manner of providing such notice. A failure by the department 16 to provide a notice or a failure by a seller to receive a 17 notice under this subsection does not relieve the seller of the 18 requirement to timely file a repayment claim. 19 4. The board shall determine that a repayment claim is 20 eligible for indemnification from the fund if the board finds 21 all of the following: 22 a. The repayment claim was timely filed. 23 b. The repayment claimant qualifies as a seller. 24 c. The repayment claim derives from a covered transaction. 25 For purposes of this paragraph, a repayment claim derives 26 from a covered transaction if the claimant is a seller who 27 transferred title to the grain to a licensed grain dealer 28 within six months of the incurrence date as provided in section 29 203D.6, subsection 2. 30 d. The seller submits adequate proof to establish the 31 repayment claim and the amount of the repayment loss. 32 e. A claim has not been paid for the same loss. 33 5. A seller is not entitled to indemnify a claim for a 34 repayment loss if the repayment loss is incurred as a result of 35 -19- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 19/ 31 H.F. 999 a fraudulent transfer or conveyance by the seller. 1 6. The dollar value loss of a repayment claim is the amount 2 a seller is required to pay back that was previously received 3 for the grain as a result of an order issued, judgment entered, 4 or settlement agreement approved by a bankruptcy court and 5 which has not been recovered through other legal or equitable 6 remedies including the liquidation of the grain dealerâs 7 assets. 8 7. The department acting on behalf of the board shall 9 deliver a notice to a seller filing a repayment claim 10 under this section. The notice must include the boardâs 11 determination of the sellerâs eligibility and the dollar value 12 of the sellerâs loss. Within twenty days of delivering the 13 notice, the seller may request a hearing for the review of 14 either determination. The request shall be made in the manner 15 provided by the board. The hearing and any further appeal 16 shall be conducted as a contested case subject to chapter 17A. 17 A seller whose repayment claim has been refused by the board 18 may appeal the refusal to either the district court of Polk 19 county or the district court of the county in which the seller 20 resides. 21 8. Upon a determination that the repayment claim is 22 eligible, the board shall provide for indemnification of ninety 23 percent of the repayment loss, as determined by the board, 24 subject to section 203D.6. If at any time the board determines 25 that there are insufficient moneys in the fund to fully 26 indemnify all eligible claims under section 203D.6 and all 27 eligible repayment claims under this section, the board shall 28 order that the eligible claims be fully indemnified during one 29 or more indemnification periods as provided in section 203D.6. 30 9. In the event of the indemnification of a repayment loss 31 under this section, the fund is subrogated to the extent of 32 the amount of any payments to all rights, powers, privileges, 33 and remedies of the seller against any person regarding 34 the repayment loss. The seller shall render all necessary 35 -20- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 20/ 31 H.F. 999 assistance to the department and the board in securing the 1 rights granted in this section. An action or claim initiated 2 by a seller and pending at the time of indemnification from the 3 fund shall not be compromised or settled without the consent 4 of the board. 5 10. a. A repayment claim shall expire if five years after 6 the board determines that the repayment claim is eligible, the 7 claimant has failed to do any of the following: 8 (1) Provide for the fundâs subrogation or render all 9 necessary assistance to the department and the board in 10 securing the departmentâs rights of subrogation as required in 11 this section. 12 (2) Provide necessary documentation or information required 13 by the board in order to process the indemnification claim. 14 b. The fund is not liable for the indemnification of an 15 expired repayment claim. 16 Sec. 20. EMERGENCY RULES. The department of agriculture 17 and land stewardship shall adopt emergency rules under section 18 17A.4, subsection 3, and section 17A.5, subsection 2, paragraph 19 âbâ, to implement the provisions of this Act within thirty 20 business days of the effective date of this section of this 21 Act and shall submit such rules to the administrative rules 22 coordinator and the administrative code editor pursuant to 23 section 17A.5, subsection 1, within the same period. The rules 24 shall be effective immediately upon filing unless a later date 25 is specified in the rules. Any rules adopted in accordance 26 with this section shall also be published as a notice of 27 intended action as provided in section 17A.4. 28 Sec. 21. ASSESSMENT OF INDEMNITY FEES. A grain dealer 29 licensed under chapter 203 who is a party to a credit-sale 30 contract shall owe any indemnity fees assessed on grain 31 purchased under the credit-sale contract beginning on the 32 following September 1 of the first assessment quarter pursuant 33 to section 203D.3A. 34 Sec. 22. EFFECTIVE DATE. The following, being deemed of 35 -21- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 21/ 31 H.F. 999 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment: 1 The section of this Act requiring the department of 2 agriculture and land stewardship to adopt emergency rules. 3 EXPLANATION 4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 5 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 6 BACKGROUND ââ REGULATION OF GRAIN MARKETERS (GRAIN DEALERS 7 AND WAREHOUSE OPERATORS). This bill amends provisions 8 regulating commercial transactions involving grain (e.g., 9 corn and soybeans) made by a grain marketer who has made 10 a promise regarding the transaction with a person for the 11 sale or storage of the grain. The grain is usually in bulk 12 form, meaning unpackaged. For purposes of the bill, a grain 13 marketer is referred to as a grain dealer purchasing grain 14 from a seller, especially a seller who is a grain producer. 15 A grain marketer may also be a bailor, referred to as a 16 warehouse operator, storing grain under bailment on behalf of 17 the bailee, referred to as a depositor. The seller and the 18 grain dealer, or the depositor and the warehouse operator, are 19 the respective parties to a legal transaction, evidenced by a 20 sales contract entered into by the seller and grain dealer, 21 or a document of title in the form of a receipt such as a 22 warehouse receipt or scale weight ticket issued by a warehouse 23 operator to a depositor. The department of agriculture and 24 land stewardship (DALS) regulates grain dealers (Code chapter 25 203) and warehouse operators (Code chapter 203C). DALS and the 26 Iowa grain indemnity fund board (board) indemnifies sellers and 27 depositors for losses incurred by the management of grain by 28 grain marketers when performing legal obligations arising under 29 the sale or deposit of the grain (Code chapter 203D). The 30 indemnification is made as a payment from the grain depositors 31 and sellers indemnity fund (fund). The fund is comprised 32 of fees established by the board and contributed to DALS by 33 grain marketers. The payment is a percentage of the dollar 34 value loss incurred by the seller or a depositor based on 35 -22- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 22/ 31 H.F. 999 the contract price or the market price offered for the same 1 quantity and quality of grain. 2 BACKGROUND ââ LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS ââ GENERAL. DALS 3 regulates grain marketers by licensure either as a grain dealer 4 or warehouse operator (licensee). DALS licenses a grain 5 dealer purchasing at least 1,000 bushels from sellers who are 6 producers during any calendar month (Code section 203.1). 7 DALS licenses a warehouse operator in the business of storing 8 bushels of grain on behalf of depositors for more than 30 days 9 (Code section 203C.1). Alternatively, a warehouse operator 10 storing grain may be licensed by the United States department 11 of agriculture (USDA) under the federal United States Warehouse 12 Act (Code section 203C.16). DALS must issue a class 1 or class 13 2 license to an applicant based on the applicantâs business 14 size. A person applying to be licensed as a grain dealer must 15 be issued a class 1 license if the value of grain purchased by 16 the grain dealer exceeds $500,000 (Code section 203.3). In 17 addition, the grain dealer must maintain a net worth of at 18 least $75,000, or alternatively maintain a deficiency bond 19 or an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $2,000 20 for each $1,000 of net worth deficiency. However, the class 21 1 grain dealerâs net worth cannot be less than $37,500. The 22 grain dealer must also maintain current assets equal to at 23 least 100 percent of current liabilities or provide a bond 24 based on the deficiency to meet that minimum requirement. The 25 grain dealer must annually submit to DALS a financial statement 26 accompanied by an unqualified opinion based upon an audit 27 performed by a certified public accountant (CPA) licensed in 28 this state. However, rather than submitting an unqualified 29 opinion, the grain dealer may elect to submit a financial 30 statement that is accompanied by the report of a CPA licensed 31 in this state that is based upon a review in lieu of an audit. 32 The requirements for a class 2 license are similar to those of 33 a class 1 license except the grain dealer must maintain a net 34 worth of at least $37,500 or maintain a deficiency bond or an 35 -23- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 23/ 31 H.F. 999 irrevocable letter of credit for $2,000 for each $1,000 of net 1 worth deficiency. A class 2 licensee must maintain a minimum 2 net worth of $17,500. 3 BACKGROUND ââ SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR GRAIN DEALERS AND 4 SELLERS ENTERING INTO CREDIT-SALE CONTRACTS. The parties 5 under a sales contract must each perform their respective 6 obligations. The buyer must pay, or tender payment of, the 7 sales price for a purchased good to the seller and the seller 8 must deliver (transfer possession and title), or tender 9 delivery of, the purchased good to the buyer, all according 10 to the sales contractâs terms. Under Code chapter 203, the 11 sales price is more commonly referred to as the purchase 12 price. Generally, as a buyer under a sales contract, the 13 grain dealer must pay the seller the sales/purchase price for 14 grain upon the grainâs delivery or upon demand for payment by 15 the seller, but not later than 30 days after delivery of the 16 grain by the seller (Code section 203.8). Delivery occurs 17 when title to and possession of the grain is transferred to 18 the grain dealer or another person in accordance with the 19 contract terms. Otherwise, a transaction in which a grain 20 dealer pays the seller for the purchased grain more than 30 21 days after the grainâs delivery is considered a credit-sale 22 contract and subject to special requirements. The grain 23 dealer must be issued a class 1 license (Code section 203.3). 24 In addition, the grain dealer must account for credit-sale 25 contract transactions by using forms and keeping records 26 involving those transactions (Code section 203.15). The grain 27 dealer must maintain 50 cents of net worth for each outstanding 28 bushel of grain purchased under credit-sale contract or may 29 maintain a deficiency bond or an irrevocable letter of credit 30 or $2,000 for each $1,000 of deficiency. The grain dealer must 31 also meet at least one of two conditions. The grain dealerâs 32 last financial statement must be accompanied by an unqualified 33 opinion based upon an audit performed by a CPA licensed in 34 this state or the grain dealer must file a bond with DALS in 35 -24- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 24/ 31 H.F. 999 the amount of $100,000 payable to DALS for use in indemnifying 1 a seller for a loss resulting from a breach of a credit-sale 2 contract. Finally, the seller must sign a form presented by a 3 grain dealer acknowledging that the seller knows that a loss 4 arising from a credit-sale contract is not indemnified by the 5 fund. 6 BILL ââ SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR GRAIN DEALERS AND SELLERS 7 ENTERING INTO CREDIT-SALE CONTRACTS. The bill distinguishes 8 between two types of credit-sale contracts: a deferred-payment 9 contract and a deferred-pricing contract (Code section 10 203.1). Under a deferred-payment contract, the licensed grain 11 dealer and seller have agreed to the purchase price for grain 12 but payment is delayed more than 30 days from the date of 13 delivery regardless of whether delivery has or has not yet 14 occurred. For example, a seller may elect to deliver (transfer 15 possession and title) grain on December 1 and receive payment 16 after January 1 to claim income in the subsequent tax year. 17 Under a deferred-pricing contract, delivery occurs but the 18 sales/purchase price has not been agreed to by the licensed 19 grain dealer and the seller. The grainâs sales/purchase price 20 paid to the seller may depend upon a speculative decision by 21 the seller to sell the grain at a future market price with the 22 expectation of increasing a profit or decreasing a loss. The 23 bill provides that a seller still cannot claim a dollar value 24 of a loss for indemnification from the fund arising from a 25 credit-sale contract classified as a deferred-payment contract 26 but that a seller may claim a limited dollar value loss for 27 indemnification arising from a deferred-pricing contract. 28 BACKGROUND ââ FUND ââ INDEMNITY FEES. In addition to license 29 fees collected by DALS for deposit into the general fund of 30 the state (Code sections 203.6 and 203C.33), each licensee may 31 be required to remit either one or two special fees (indemnity 32 fees) collected by DALS for deposit in the fund, referred 33 to as a participation fee and per-bushel fee. The licensed 34 grain dealerâs participation fee is calculated according to 35 -25- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 25/ 31 H.F. 999 the following formula: the assessment rate of not more than 1 $0.014 multiplied by all bushels of purchased grain during the 2 grain dealerâs prior fiscal year with a minimum of $50 and no 3 maximum limit. The licensed grain dealerâs per-bushel fee is 4 calculated according to a similar formula: the assessment 5 rate of not more than $0.25 multiplied by all bushels of 6 purchased grain for the grain dealerâs assessment year with 7 no minimum or maximum limit. The qualifying term âpurchased 8 grainâ equals the total number of bushels purchased from a 9 seller by a grain dealer minus a number of exempt bushels, 10 including those purchased under credit-sale contract (Code 11 section 203D.1). Purchased grain is reported to DALS as âpaid 12 company-ownedâ (Code section 203D.1). The licensed warehouse 13 operatorâs participation fee is based on the number of bushels 14 of bulk grain storage capacity of the warehouse (Code section 15 203D.5). The licensed warehouse operatorâs participation 16 fee is calculated according to the following formula: the 17 assessment rate of not more than $0.014 multiplied by the 18 bulk grain storage capacity for the licensed warehouse with a 19 minimum $50 and a maximum $500 limit (Code section 203D.5). An 20 assessment year begins September 1 and ends August 31 (Code 21 sections 203D.3 and 203D.5). The assessment year is further 22 divided into four three-month assessment quarters. A grain 23 dealer or warehouse operator may remit a participation fee 24 annually (with an application for an initial license or the 25 renewal of a license) or for the renewal of a license on a 26 quarterly basis. A grain dealer must remit a per-bushel fee on 27 a quarterly basis (Code section 203D.3A). 28 BACKGROUND ââ BOARD REVIEW OF FUND. The board must 29 annually review the debits of and credits to the fund and 30 by May 1 determine whether to impose the indemnity fees, 31 make adjustments to the existing indemnity fees, or waive 32 the existing indemnity fees as necessary to comply with two 33 triggers. The balance in the fund triggers the indemnity 34 fees waiver or reinstatement (Code section 203D.5). When the 35 -26- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 26/ 31 H.F. 999 balance in the fund reaches $8 million, the indemnity fees 1 are automatically waived. The indemnity fees are reinstated 2 by the board if the balance in the fund is $3 million or less 3 (Code section 203D.5). The triggered waiver or reinstatement 4 is effective on the first day of the following assessment year 5 (September 1). A licensee is required to remit the outstanding 6 amount of the waived participation fee that is otherwise owing 7 for the current assessment year. However, a licensed grain 8 dealer is no longer obligated to remit the outstanding amount 9 of the per-bushel fee otherwise owing for that period, unless 10 the amount is delinquent (Code section 203D.5). 11 BACKGROUND ââ FUND ââ VALUE OF LOSS. Generally, a loss 12 incurred by a depositor (holding a warehouse receipt or scale 13 weight ticket) or seller who is a party to a sale is the amount 14 stated in an eligible claim held by a depositor that states the 15 amount owed by a warehouse operator or held by a seller that 16 states the amount owed by a grain dealer, if either such amount 17 has not been recovered by other legal and equitable remedies 18 (Code section 203D.1). The dollar value of the loss may be 19 determined using several methods of valuation (Code section 20 203D.6). For a depositor, it may be part of a court order 21 after hearing the matter in a DALSâ receivership. Otherwise, 22 the loss is based on the fair market price paid to producer 23 sellers at a nearby terminal on an incurrence date. For a 24 seller, it may be the sales price agreed to by the parties. 25 If the grain has not yet been priced, the loss is again based 26 on the fair market price paid at the terminal on one of those 27 incurrence dates. An incurrence date is either the cessation 28 of the license of a warehouse operator or grain dealer (by 29 revocations, cancellation, or expiration) or the licenseeâs 30 filing of a petition in bankruptcy. 31 BACKGROUND ââ FUND ââ PAYMENT OF CLAIMS. A claim must 32 meet eligibility requirements, including that it is timely 33 filed, there is evidence of a loss incurred by a claimant, 34 and the claim derives from a covered transaction during 35 -27- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 27/ 31 H.F. 999 the claim period. For a claimant who is a depositor, a 1 covered transaction requires that the grain must have been 2 delivered to a licensed warehouse operator. For a claimant 3 who is a seller, a covered transaction requires that title 4 be transferred within six months of the incurrence date. A 5 covered transaction excludes sale by credit-sale contract. The 6 board must indemnify a claimant (a grain dealer and warehouse 7 operator) 90 percent of the combined losses, if the losses are 8 part of the same covered transaction during the indemnity claim 9 period. However, the board cannot indemnify a claimant more 10 than $300,000 for all such losses (Code section 203D.6). 11 BILL ââ FUND ââ INDEMNITY FEES. After paying the initial 12 participation fee for the issuance of a new license, the 13 licensee must remit a participation fee in one installment 14 as part of a license renewal application in the same manner 15 provided for a new license (Code section 203D.3A). However, 16 the bill allows the licensee to continue to elect to remit the 17 participation fee on four successive installment dates. The 18 bill provides that each installment date occurs in the month 19 succeeding the last assessment quarter on a date determined 20 by rules adopted by DALS. The bill requires a licensed 21 grain dealer to remit the per-bushel fee on the following 22 four successive installment dates: December 15, March 15, 23 June 15, and September 15. The bill provides a special 24 per-bushel waiver is applicable to purchased grain that 25 is unpriced on the last date of the fundâs assessment year 26 (Code section 203D.5). The bill provides that grain sold by 27 deferred-pricing contract is considered purchased grain and 28 grain sold by deferred-payment contract is not. Therefore, 29 a licensed grain dealer is only assessed an indemnity fee on 30 the deferred-pricing contract grain (Code sections 203D.3 and 31 203D.3A). 32 BILL ââ INDEMNITY FEES ââ TRIGGERS. The bill adjusts both 33 triggers waiving or reinstating the two indemnity fees. The 34 bill increases from $8 million to $16 million the balance in 35 -28- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 28/ 31 H.F. 999 the fund required to trigger a waiver and increases from $3 1 million to $8 million the balance in the fund required to 2 trigger a reinstatement (Code section 203D.5). 3 BILL ââ FUND ââ DOLLAR VALUE OF LOSSES. The bill 4 requires that a loss incurred by a seller who was a party 5 to a credit-sale contract must be segregated, including a 6 deferred-pricing contract and deferred-payment contract. The 7 bill provides special valuation rules for losses incurred by 8 a depositor or seller. The dollar value of a loss of priced 9 or unpriced grain cannot exceed the price of that grain if the 10 grain were valued as U.S. No. 2 grain according to standards 11 adopted by the federal grain inspection service of the USDA. 12 DALS may adjust the price of the grain if necessary to better 13 account for its condition when stored or sold. 14 BILL ââ INDEMNIFICATION OF REPAYMENT LOSSES (REPAYMENT 15 CLAIMS). The bill allows a seller to file a special repayment 16 claim against the fund as a result of the grain dealerâs 17 bankruptcy (Code section 203D.6A). The special repayment 18 process allows such a seller to recover the amount of the 19 grain dealer payment that the seller was forced to repay to 20 the grain dealerâs bankruptcy estate. To be timely, a seller 21 must file a repayment claim with DALS not later than 30 days 22 after the repayment loss is finalized by a bankruptcy court. 23 DALS may provide notice of the repayment claim process to 24 a seller who may file a repayment claim. If DALS chooses 25 to provide a notice to the seller, DALS has discretion to 26 determine a reasonable method and manner of providing such 27 notice. The board must determine that a repayment claim is 28 eligible for payment from the indemnity fund, including whether 29 the repayment claim derives from a covered transaction. DALS 30 is required to deliver notice to a seller filing a repayment 31 claim regarding the indemnity boardâs determination in the same 32 manner as for an ordinary loss. 33 BILL ââ INDEMNIFICATION OF DOLLAR VALUE LOSSES. The bill 34 provides that upon a determination by the board that a claim is 35 -29- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 29/ 31 H.F. 999 eligible, the board must indemnify the claimant as a depositor 1 or a seller incurring ordinary dollar value losses and as a 2 seller incurring repayment (dollar value) losses, if all such 3 dollar value losses derive from the same covered transaction 4 during the claim period (Code section 203D.6). With one 5 exception, the board must indemnify a claimant 90 percent 6 of the combined dollar value losses. The exception applies 7 to a segregated dollar value loss incurred from the sale of 8 grain under a credit-sale contract. The board must indemnify 9 the seller 70 percent of the dollar value loss incurred from 10 the sale of grain under a deferred-pricing contract and 0 11 percent of the dollar value loss for the sale of grain under a 12 deferred-payment contract. The full indemnity amount paid to a 13 claimant still cannot exceed the existing limit of $300,000. 14 BILL ââ ORDER OF INDEMNIFICATION AND INDEMNIFICATION 15 PERIODS. The board must indemnify claims by giving priority to 16 claims that are not segregated (arising from a deferred-pricing 17 contract). If there are not sufficient moneys in the indemnity 18 fund to indemnify all claims, the board may establish one or 19 more eligible claim indemnification periods required to fully 20 indemnify claims that have not been satisfied. 21 BILL ââ EMERGENCY RULES. DALS is authorized to adopt 22 rules on an emergency basis necessary to administer the 23 billâs provisions. When a statute authorizes emergency 24 rulemaking, an agency may adopt a rule immediately without 25 going through the periods of the rulemaking process known 26 as regulatory analysis (Code section 17A.4A) and notice of 27 intended action (Code section 17A.4(3)). The bill requires 28 that such emergency rulemaking be âdouble barreledâ. Under 29 that process, when an agency files an emergency rule, it also 30 files the same rule as a notice of intended action that will 31 follow the regular rulemaking process. Normally, a rule 32 cannot be effective prior to 35 days after its filing with the 33 administrative rules coordinator and publication in the Iowa 34 administrative bulletin. Under emergency rulemaking, a rule 35 -30- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 30/ 31 H.F. 999 can be made effective on the date of filing and acceptance 1 by the administrative rules coordinator or any subsequent 2 date, as specified by the agency in the filing (Code section 3 17A.5(2)(b)(1)). This provision of the bill takes effect upon 4 enactment. 5 BILL ââ ASSESSMENT OF INDEMNITY FEES (CREDIT-SALE CONTRACT). 6 A grain dealer who is a party to a credit-sale contract owing 7 an indemnity fee assessed on grain purchased by credit-sale 8 contract as provided in the bill is imposed on September 1 of 9 the first assessment quarter. 10 -31- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 31/ 31

NEW SECTION . 203D.6A Indemnification of repayment 22 loss against fund. 23 1. A separate process is established to provide for 24 indemnification of a repayment loss incurred by a seller 25 against a grain dealer who is a debtor in bankruptcy under the 26 protections provided in Tit. 11 of the United States Code. 27 a. A repayment claim that includes the repayment loss shall 28 be filed with the department in the manner prescribed by the 29 department. 30 b. A seller may file an eligible claim for a dollar value 31 loss under section 203D.6 and an eligible repayment claim for a 32 repayment loss under this section. 33 c. The department may consolidate a repayment claim filed 34 under this subsection with a claim filed by the same claimant 35 -18- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 18/ 31 H.F. 999 that is part of the same covered transaction under the claim 1 period as provided in section 203D.6. 2 2. To be timely, a seller must file a repayment claim with 3 the department not later than sixty days after the repayment 4 claimâs dollar value loss is finalized by a bankruptcy court, 5 whether by an order issued, judgment entered, or settlement 6 agreement approved. 7 3. The department may provide notice of the repayment claim 8 process to a seller that may become or has become subject to 9 an order issued, judgment entered, or settlement agreement 10 approved by a bankruptcy court that requires the seller to 11 pay back amounts previously received for grain purchased by a 12 licensed grain dealer, in the bankruptcy of the grain dealer. 13 If the department chooses to provide a notice to the seller, it 14 shall have discretion to determine any reasonable method and 15 manner of providing such notice. A failure by the department 16 to provide a notice or a failure by a seller to receive a 17 notice under this subsection does not relieve the seller of the 18 requirement to timely file a repayment claim. 19 4. The board shall determine that a repayment claim is 20 eligible for indemnification from the fund if the board finds 21 all of the following: 22 a. The repayment claim was timely filed. 23 b. The repayment claimant qualifies as a seller. 24 c. The repayment claim derives from a covered transaction. 25 For purposes of this paragraph, a repayment claim derives 26 from a covered transaction if the claimant is a seller who 27 transferred title to the grain to a licensed grain dealer 28 within six months of the incurrence date as provided in section 29 203D.6, subsection 2. 30 d. The seller submits adequate proof to establish the 31 repayment claim and the amount of the repayment loss. 32 e. A claim has not been paid for the same loss. 33 5. A seller is not entitled to indemnify a claim for a 34 repayment loss if the repayment loss is incurred as a result of 35 -19- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 19/ 31 H.F. 999 a fraudulent transfer or conveyance by the seller. 1 6. The dollar value loss of a repayment claim is the amount 2 a seller is required to pay back that was previously received 3 for the grain as a result of an order issued, judgment entered, 4 or settlement agreement approved by a bankruptcy court and 5 which has not been recovered through other legal or equitable 6 remedies including the liquidation of the grain dealerâs 7 assets. 8 7. The department acting on behalf of the board shall 9 deliver a notice to a seller filing a repayment claim 10 under this section. The notice must include the boardâs 11 determination of the sellerâs eligibility and the dollar value 12 of the sellerâs loss. Within twenty days of delivering the 13 notice, the seller may request a hearing for the review of 14 either determination. The request shall be made in the manner 15 provided by the board. The hearing and any further appeal 16 shall be conducted as a contested case subject to chapter 17A. 17 A seller whose repayment claim has been refused by the board 18 may appeal the refusal to either the district court of Polk 19 county or the district court of the county in which the seller 20 resides. 21 8. Upon a determination that the repayment claim is 22 eligible, the board shall provide for indemnification of ninety 23 percent of the repayment loss, as determined by the board, 24 subject to section 203D.6. If at any time the board determines 25 that there are insufficient moneys in the fund to fully 26 indemnify all eligible claims under section 203D.6 and all 27 eligible repayment claims under this section, the board shall 28 order that the eligible claims be fully indemnified during one 29 or more indemnification periods as provided in section 203D.6. 30 9. In the event of the indemnification of a repayment loss 31 under this section, the fund is subrogated to the extent of 32 the amount of any payments to all rights, powers, privileges, 33 and remedies of the seller against any person regarding 34 the repayment loss. The seller shall render all necessary 35 -20- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 20/ 31 H.F. 999 assistance to the department and the board in securing the 1 rights granted in this section. An action or claim initiated 2 by a seller and pending at the time of indemnification from the 3 fund shall not be compromised or settled without the consent 4 of the board. 5 10. a. A repayment claim shall expire if five years after 6 the board determines that the repayment claim is eligible, the 7 claimant has failed to do any of the following: 8 (1) Provide for the fundâs subrogation or render all 9 necessary assistance to the department and the board in 10 securing the departmentâs rights of subrogation as required in 11 this section. 12 (2) Provide necessary documentation or information required 13 by the board in order to process the indemnification claim. 14 b. The fund is not liable for the indemnification of an 15 expired repayment claim. 16 Sec. 20. EMERGENCY RULES. The department of agriculture 17 and land stewardship shall adopt emergency rules under section 18 17A.4, subsection 3, and section 17A.5, subsection 2, paragraph 19 âbâ, to implement the provisions of this Act within thirty 20 business days of the effective date of this section of this 21 Act and shall submit such rules to the administrative rules 22 coordinator and the administrative code editor pursuant to 23 section 17A.5, subsection 1, within the same period. The rules 24 shall be effective immediately upon filing unless a later date 25 is specified in the rules. Any rules adopted in accordance 26 with this section shall also be published as a notice of 27 intended action as provided in section 17A.4. 28 Sec. 21. ASSESSMENT OF INDEMNITY FEES. A grain dealer 29 licensed under chapter 203 who is a party to a credit-sale 30 contract shall owe any indemnity fees assessed on grain 31 purchased under the credit-sale contract beginning on the 32 following September 1 of the first assessment quarter pursuant 33 to section 203D.3A. 34 Sec. 22. EFFECTIVE DATE. The following, being deemed of 35 -21- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 21/ 31 H.F. 999 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment: 1 The section of this Act requiring the department of 2 agriculture and land stewardship to adopt emergency rules. 3 EXPLANATION 4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 5 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 6 BACKGROUND ââ REGULATION OF GRAIN MARKETERS (GRAIN DEALERS 7 AND WAREHOUSE OPERATORS). This bill amends provisions 8 regulating commercial transactions involving grain (e.g., 9 corn and soybeans) made by a grain marketer who has made 10 a promise regarding the transaction with a person for the 11 sale or storage of the grain. The grain is usually in bulk 12 form, meaning unpackaged. For purposes of the bill, a grain 13 marketer is referred to as a grain dealer purchasing grain 14 from a seller, especially a seller who is a grain producer. 15 A grain marketer may also be a bailor, referred to as a 16 warehouse operator, storing grain under bailment on behalf of 17 the bailee, referred to as a depositor. The seller and the 18 grain dealer, or the depositor and the warehouse operator, are 19 the respective parties to a legal transaction, evidenced by a 20 sales contract entered into by the seller and grain dealer, 21 or a document of title in the form of a receipt such as a 22 warehouse receipt or scale weight ticket issued by a warehouse 23 operator to a depositor. The department of agriculture and 24 land stewardship (DALS) regulates grain dealers (Code chapter 25 203) and warehouse operators (Code chapter 203C). DALS and the 26 Iowa grain indemnity fund board (board) indemnifies sellers and 27 depositors for losses incurred by the management of grain by 28 grain marketers when performing legal obligations arising under 29 the sale or deposit of the grain (Code chapter 203D). The 30 indemnification is made as a payment from the grain depositors 31 and sellers indemnity fund (fund). The fund is comprised 32 of fees established by the board and contributed to DALS by 33 grain marketers. The payment is a percentage of the dollar 34 value loss incurred by the seller or a depositor based on 35 -22- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 22/ 31 H.F. 999 the contract price or the market price offered for the same 1 quantity and quality of grain. 2 BACKGROUND ââ LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS ââ GENERAL. DALS 3 regulates grain marketers by licensure either as a grain dealer 4 or warehouse operator (licensee). DALS licenses a grain 5 dealer purchasing at least 1,000 bushels from sellers who are 6 producers during any calendar month (Code section 203.1). 7 DALS licenses a warehouse operator in the business of storing 8 bushels of grain on behalf of depositors for more than 30 days 9 (Code section 203C.1). Alternatively, a warehouse operator 10 storing grain may be licensed by the United States department 11 of agriculture (USDA) under the federal United States Warehouse 12 Act (Code section 203C.16). DALS must issue a class 1 or class 13 2 license to an applicant based on the applicantâs business 14 size. A person applying to be licensed as a grain dealer must 15 be issued a class 1 license if the value of grain purchased by 16 the grain dealer exceeds $500,000 (Code section 203.3). In 17 addition, the grain dealer must maintain a net worth of at 18 least $75,000, or alternatively maintain a deficiency bond 19 or an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $2,000 20 for each $1,000 of net worth deficiency. However, the class 21 1 grain dealerâs net worth cannot be less than $37,500. The 22 grain dealer must also maintain current assets equal to at 23 least 100 percent of current liabilities or provide a bond 24 based on the deficiency to meet that minimum requirement. The 25 grain dealer must annually submit to DALS a financial statement 26 accompanied by an unqualified opinion based upon an audit 27 performed by a certified public accountant (CPA) licensed in 28 this state. However, rather than submitting an unqualified 29 opinion, the grain dealer may elect to submit a financial 30 statement that is accompanied by the report of a CPA licensed 31 in this state that is based upon a review in lieu of an audit. 32 The requirements for a class 2 license are similar to those of 33 a class 1 license except the grain dealer must maintain a net 34 worth of at least $37,500 or maintain a deficiency bond or an 35 -23- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 23/ 31 H.F. 999 irrevocable letter of credit for $2,000 for each $1,000 of net 1 worth deficiency. A class 2 licensee must maintain a minimum 2 net worth of $17,500. 3 BACKGROUND ââ SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR GRAIN DEALERS AND 4 SELLERS ENTERING INTO CREDIT-SALE CONTRACTS. The parties 5 under a sales contract must each perform their respective 6 obligations. The buyer must pay, or tender payment of, the 7 sales price for a purchased good to the seller and the seller 8 must deliver (transfer possession and title), or tender 9 delivery of, the purchased good to the buyer, all according 10 to the sales contractâs terms. Under Code chapter 203, the 11 sales price is more commonly referred to as the purchase 12 price. Generally, as a buyer under a sales contract, the 13 grain dealer must pay the seller the sales/purchase price for 14 grain upon the grainâs delivery or upon demand for payment by 15 the seller, but not later than 30 days after delivery of the 16 grain by the seller (Code section 203.8). Delivery occurs 17 when title to and possession of the grain is transferred to 18 the grain dealer or another person in accordance with the 19 contract terms. Otherwise, a transaction in which a grain 20 dealer pays the seller for the purchased grain more than 30 21 days after the grainâs delivery is considered a credit-sale 22 contract and subject to special requirements. The grain 23 dealer must be issued a class 1 license (Code section 203.3). 24 In addition, the grain dealer must account for credit-sale 25 contract transactions by using forms and keeping records 26 involving those transactions (Code section 203.15). The grain 27 dealer must maintain 50 cents of net worth for each outstanding 28 bushel of grain purchased under credit-sale contract or may 29 maintain a deficiency bond or an irrevocable letter of credit 30 or $2,000 for each $1,000 of deficiency. The grain dealer must 31 also meet at least one of two conditions. The grain dealerâs 32 last financial statement must be accompanied by an unqualified 33 opinion based upon an audit performed by a CPA licensed in 34 this state or the grain dealer must file a bond with DALS in 35 -24- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 24/ 31 H.F. 999 the amount of $100,000 payable to DALS for use in indemnifying 1 a seller for a loss resulting from a breach of a credit-sale 2 contract. Finally, the seller must sign a form presented by a 3 grain dealer acknowledging that the seller knows that a loss 4 arising from a credit-sale contract is not indemnified by the 5 fund. 6 BILL ââ SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR GRAIN DEALERS AND SELLERS 7 ENTERING INTO CREDIT-SALE CONTRACTS. The bill distinguishes 8 between two types of credit-sale contracts: a deferred-payment 9 contract and a deferred-pricing contract (Code section 10 203.1). Under a deferred-payment contract, the licensed grain 11 dealer and seller have agreed to the purchase price for grain 12 but payment is delayed more than 30 days from the date of 13 delivery regardless of whether delivery has or has not yet 14 occurred. For example, a seller may elect to deliver (transfer 15 possession and title) grain on December 1 and receive payment 16 after January 1 to claim income in the subsequent tax year. 17 Under a deferred-pricing contract, delivery occurs but the 18 sales/purchase price has not been agreed to by the licensed 19 grain dealer and the seller. The grainâs sales/purchase price 20 paid to the seller may depend upon a speculative decision by 21 the seller to sell the grain at a future market price with the 22 expectation of increasing a profit or decreasing a loss. The 23 bill provides that a seller still cannot claim a dollar value 24 of a loss for indemnification from the fund arising from a 25 credit-sale contract classified as a deferred-payment contract 26 but that a seller may claim a limited dollar value loss for 27 indemnification arising from a deferred-pricing contract. 28 BACKGROUND ââ FUND ââ INDEMNITY FEES. In addition to license 29 fees collected by DALS for deposit into the general fund of 30 the state (Code sections 203.6 and 203C.33), each licensee may 31 be required to remit either one or two special fees (indemnity 32 fees) collected by DALS for deposit in the fund, referred 33 to as a participation fee and per-bushel fee. The licensed 34 grain dealerâs participation fee is calculated according to 35 -25- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 25/ 31 H.F. 999 the following formula: the assessment rate of not more than 1 $0.014 multiplied by all bushels of purchased grain during the 2 grain dealerâs prior fiscal year with a minimum of $50 and no 3 maximum limit. The licensed grain dealerâs per-bushel fee is 4 calculated according to a similar formula: the assessment 5 rate of not more than $0.25 multiplied by all bushels of 6 purchased grain for the grain dealerâs assessment year with 7 no minimum or maximum limit. The qualifying term âpurchased 8 grainâ equals the total number of bushels purchased from a 9 seller by a grain dealer minus a number of exempt bushels, 10 including those purchased under credit-sale contract (Code 11 section 203D.1). Purchased grain is reported to DALS as âpaid 12 company-ownedâ (Code section 203D.1). The licensed warehouse 13 operatorâs participation fee is based on the number of bushels 14 of bulk grain storage capacity of the warehouse (Code section 15 203D.5). The licensed warehouse operatorâs participation 16 fee is calculated according to the following formula: the 17 assessment rate of not more than $0.014 multiplied by the 18 bulk grain storage capacity for the licensed warehouse with a 19 minimum $50 and a maximum $500 limit (Code section 203D.5). An 20 assessment year begins September 1 and ends August 31 (Code 21 sections 203D.3 and 203D.5). The assessment year is further 22 divided into four three-month assessment quarters. A grain 23 dealer or warehouse operator may remit a participation fee 24 annually (with an application for an initial license or the 25 renewal of a license) or for the renewal of a license on a 26 quarterly basis. A grain dealer must remit a per-bushel fee on 27 a quarterly basis (Code section 203D.3A). 28 BACKGROUND ââ BOARD REVIEW OF FUND. The board must 29 annually review the debits of and credits to the fund and 30 by May 1 determine whether to impose the indemnity fees, 31 make adjustments to the existing indemnity fees, or waive 32 the existing indemnity fees as necessary to comply with two 33 triggers. The balance in the fund triggers the indemnity 34 fees waiver or reinstatement (Code section 203D.5). When the 35 -26- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 26/ 31 H.F. 999 balance in the fund reaches $8 million, the indemnity fees 1 are automatically waived. The indemnity fees are reinstated 2 by the board if the balance in the fund is $3 million or less 3 (Code section 203D.5). The triggered waiver or reinstatement 4 is effective on the first day of the following assessment year 5 (September 1). A licensee is required to remit the outstanding 6 amount of the waived participation fee that is otherwise owing 7 for the current assessment year. However, a licensed grain 8 dealer is no longer obligated to remit the outstanding amount 9 of the per-bushel fee otherwise owing for that period, unless 10 the amount is delinquent (Code section 203D.5). 11 BACKGROUND ââ FUND ââ VALUE OF LOSS. Generally, a loss 12 incurred by a depositor (holding a warehouse receipt or scale 13 weight ticket) or seller who is a party to a sale is the amount 14 stated in an eligible claim held by a depositor that states the 15 amount owed by a warehouse operator or held by a seller that 16 states the amount owed by a grain dealer, if either such amount 17 has not been recovered by other legal and equitable remedies 18 (Code section 203D.1). The dollar value of the loss may be 19 determined using several methods of valuation (Code section 20 203D.6). For a depositor, it may be part of a court order 21 after hearing the matter in a DALSâ receivership. Otherwise, 22 the loss is based on the fair market price paid to producer 23 sellers at a nearby terminal on an incurrence date. For a 24 seller, it may be the sales price agreed to by the parties. 25 If the grain has not yet been priced, the loss is again based 26 on the fair market price paid at the terminal on one of those 27 incurrence dates. An incurrence date is either the cessation 28 of the license of a warehouse operator or grain dealer (by 29 revocations, cancellation, or expiration) or the licenseeâs 30 filing of a petition in bankruptcy. 31 BACKGROUND ââ FUND ââ PAYMENT OF CLAIMS. A claim must 32 meet eligibility requirements, including that it is timely 33 filed, there is evidence of a loss incurred by a claimant, 34 and the claim derives from a covered transaction during 35 -27- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 27/ 31 H.F. 999 the claim period. For a claimant who is a depositor, a 1 covered transaction requires that the grain must have been 2 delivered to a licensed warehouse operator. For a claimant 3 who is a seller, a covered transaction requires that title 4 be transferred within six months of the incurrence date. A 5 covered transaction excludes sale by credit-sale contract. The 6 board must indemnify a claimant (a grain dealer and warehouse 7 operator) 90 percent of the combined losses, if the losses are 8 part of the same covered transaction during the indemnity claim 9 period. However, the board cannot indemnify a claimant more 10 than $300,000 for all such losses (Code section 203D.6). 11 BILL ââ FUND ââ INDEMNITY FEES. After paying the initial 12 participation fee for the issuance of a new license, the 13 licensee must remit a participation fee in one installment 14 as part of a license renewal application in the same manner 15 provided for a new license (Code section 203D.3A). However, 16 the bill allows the licensee to continue to elect to remit the 17 participation fee on four successive installment dates. The 18 bill provides that each installment date occurs in the month 19 succeeding the last assessment quarter on a date determined 20 by rules adopted by DALS. The bill requires a licensed 21 grain dealer to remit the per-bushel fee on the following 22 four successive installment dates: December 15, March 15, 23 June 15, and September 15. The bill provides a special 24 per-bushel waiver is applicable to purchased grain that 25 is unpriced on the last date of the fundâs assessment year 26 (Code section 203D.5). The bill provides that grain sold by 27 deferred-pricing contract is considered purchased grain and 28 grain sold by deferred-payment contract is not. Therefore, 29 a licensed grain dealer is only assessed an indemnity fee on 30 the deferred-pricing contract grain (Code sections 203D.3 and 31 203D.3A). 32 BILL ââ INDEMNITY FEES ââ TRIGGERS. The bill adjusts both 33 triggers waiving or reinstating the two indemnity fees. The 34 bill increases from $8 million to $16 million the balance in 35 -28- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 28/ 31 H.F. 999 the fund required to trigger a waiver and increases from $3 1 million to $8 million the balance in the fund required to 2 trigger a reinstatement (Code section 203D.5). 3 BILL ââ FUND ââ DOLLAR VALUE OF LOSSES. The bill 4 requires that a loss incurred by a seller who was a party 5 to a credit-sale contract must be segregated, including a 6 deferred-pricing contract and deferred-payment contract. The 7 bill provides special valuation rules for losses incurred by 8 a depositor or seller. The dollar value of a loss of priced 9 or unpriced grain cannot exceed the price of that grain if the 10 grain were valued as U.S. No. 2 grain according to standards 11 adopted by the federal grain inspection service of the USDA. 12 DALS may adjust the price of the grain if necessary to better 13 account for its condition when stored or sold. 14 BILL ââ INDEMNIFICATION OF REPAYMENT LOSSES (REPAYMENT 15 CLAIMS). The bill allows a seller to file a special repayment 16 claim against the fund as a result of the grain dealerâs 17 bankruptcy (Code section 203D.6A). The special repayment 18 process allows such a seller to recover the amount of the 19 grain dealer payment that the seller was forced to repay to 20 the grain dealerâs bankruptcy estate. To be timely, a seller 21 must file a repayment claim with DALS not later than 30 days 22 after the repayment loss is finalized by a bankruptcy court. 23 DALS may provide notice of the repayment claim process to 24 a seller who may file a repayment claim. If DALS chooses 25 to provide a notice to the seller, DALS has discretion to 26 determine a reasonable method and manner of providing such 27 notice. The board must determine that a repayment claim is 28 eligible for payment from the indemnity fund, including whether 29 the repayment claim derives from a covered transaction. DALS 30 is required to deliver notice to a seller filing a repayment 31 claim regarding the indemnity boardâs determination in the same 32 manner as for an ordinary loss. 33 BILL ââ INDEMNIFICATION OF DOLLAR VALUE LOSSES. The bill 34 provides that upon a determination by the board that a claim is 35 -29- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 29/ 31 H.F. 999 eligible, the board must indemnify the claimant as a depositor 1 or a seller incurring ordinary dollar value losses and as a 2 seller incurring repayment (dollar value) losses, if all such 3 dollar value losses derive from the same covered transaction 4 during the claim period (Code section 203D.6). With one 5 exception, the board must indemnify a claimant 90 percent 6 of the combined dollar value losses. The exception applies 7 to a segregated dollar value loss incurred from the sale of 8 grain under a credit-sale contract. The board must indemnify 9 the seller 70 percent of the dollar value loss incurred from 10 the sale of grain under a deferred-pricing contract and 0 11 percent of the dollar value loss for the sale of grain under a 12 deferred-payment contract. The full indemnity amount paid to a 13 claimant still cannot exceed the existing limit of $300,000. 14 BILL ââ ORDER OF INDEMNIFICATION AND INDEMNIFICATION 15 PERIODS. The board must indemnify claims by giving priority to 16 claims that are not segregated (arising from a deferred-pricing 17 contract). If there are not sufficient moneys in the indemnity 18 fund to indemnify all claims, the board may establish one or 19 more eligible claim indemnification periods required to fully 20 indemnify claims that have not been satisfied. 21 BILL ââ EMERGENCY RULES. DALS is authorized to adopt 22 rules on an emergency basis necessary to administer the 23 billâs provisions. When a statute authorizes emergency 24 rulemaking, an agency may adopt a rule immediately without 25 going through the periods of the rulemaking process known 26 as regulatory analysis (Code section 17A.4A) and notice of 27 intended action (Code section 17A.4(3)). The bill requires 28 that such emergency rulemaking be âdouble barreledâ. Under 29 that process, when an agency files an emergency rule, it also 30 files the same rule as a notice of intended action that will 31 follow the regular rulemaking process. Normally, a rule 32 cannot be effective prior to 35 days after its filing with the 33 administrative rules coordinator and publication in the Iowa 34 administrative bulletin. Under emergency rulemaking, a rule 35 -30- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 30/ 31 H.F. 999 can be made effective on the date of filing and acceptance 1 by the administrative rules coordinator or any subsequent 2 date, as specified by the agency in the filing (Code section 3 17A.5(2)(b)(1)). This provision of the bill takes effect upon 4 enactment. 5 BILL ââ ASSESSMENT OF INDEMNITY FEES (CREDIT-SALE CONTRACT). 6 A grain dealer who is a party to a credit-sale contract owing 7 an indemnity fee assessed on grain purchased by credit-sale 8 contract as provided in the bill is imposed on September 1 of 9 the first assessment quarter. 10 -31- LSB 2306HZ (4) 91 da/ns 31/ 31
