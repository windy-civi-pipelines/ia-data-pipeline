11 in writing and filed with the grain dealer and with the issuer
12 of a deficiency bond or of an irrevocable letter of credit
13 and with the department within one hundred twenty days after
14 the date of the cessation. A failure to make this timely
15 claim relieves the issuer and the grain depositors and sellers
16 indemnity fund provided in chapter 203D section 203D.6 or
17 203D.6A of all obligations to the claimant.
18 Sec. 2. Section 203.15, subsection 6, Code 2025, is amended

27 bond, or an irrevocable letter of credit, and, if the claim
28 relates to bulk grain, with the department. The claim must
29 be made within one hundred twenty days after the cessation
30 of the license. The failure to make a timely claim relieves
31 the issuer and, if the claim relates to bulk grain, the grain

5 seller has paid back that was previously received for the grain

11 in writing and filed with the grain dealer and with the issuer
12 of a deficiency bond or of an irrevocable letter of credit

15 claim relieves the issuer and the grain depositors and sellers
16 indemnity fund provided in chapter 203D section 203D.6 or
17 203D.6A of all obligations to the claimant.
18 Sec. 2. Section 203.15, subsection 6, Code 2025, is amended

28 relates to bulk grain, with the department. The claim must
29 be made within one hundred twenty days after the cessation
30 of the license. The failure to make a timely claim relieves

1 a. A repayment claim shall be filed with the department in
2 the manner prescribed by the department.
3 b. A seller may file an eligible claim for a loss under
4 section 203D.6 and an eligible repayment claim for a repayment
5 loss under this section.
6 2. To be timely, a seller must file a repayment claim with
7 the department not later than sixty days after the repayment
8 loss is finalized by a bankruptcy court, whether by an order
9 issued, judgment entered, or settlement agreement approved.
10 3. The department may provide notice of the repayment claim
11 process to a seller that may become or has become subject to
12 an order issued, judgment entered, or settlement agreement
13 approved by a bankruptcy court that requires the seller to
14 pay back amounts previously received for grain purchased by a
15 licensed grain dealer, in the bankruptcy of the grain dealer.
16 If the department chooses to provide a notice to the seller, it
17 shall have discretion to determine any reasonable method and
18 manner of providing such notice. A failure by the department
19 to provide a notice or a failure by a seller to receive a notice
20 under this subsection, does not relieve the seller of the
21 requirement to timely file a repayment claim.
22 4. The board shall determine that a repayment claim is
23 eligible for payment from the fund if the board finds all of
24 the following:
25 a. The repayment claim was timely filed.
26 b. The repayment claimant qualifies as a seller.
27 c. The repayment claim derives from a covered transaction.
28 For purposes of this paragraph, a claim derives from a covered
29 transaction if the claimant is a seller who transferred title
30 to the grain to a licensed grain dealer within six months of
31 the incurrence date as provided in section 203D.6, subsection
32 2.
33 d. The seller submits adequate proof to establish the
34 repayment claim and the amount of the repayment loss.
35 e. A claim has not been paid for the same repayment loss.

1 5. A seller is not entitled to indemnify a claim for a
2 repayment loss if the repayment loss is incurred as a result of
3 a fraudulent transfer or conveyance by the seller.
4 6. The dollar value of a repayment claim is the amount a
5 seller has paid back that was previously received for the grain
6 as a result of an order issued, judgment entered, or settlement
7 agreement approved by a bankruptcy court and which has not been
8 recovered through other legal or equitable remedies including
9 the liquidation of assets.
10 7. The department acting on behalf of the board shall
11 deliver a notice to a seller filing a claim under this section.
12 The notice must include the board’s determination of the
13 seller’s eligibility and the value of the seller’s repayment
14 loss. Within twenty days of delivering the notice, the seller
15 may request a hearing for the review of either determination.
16 The request shall be made in the manner provided by the
17 board. The hearing and any further appeal shall be conducted
18 as a contested case subject to chapter 17A. A seller whose
19 repayment claim has been refused by the board may appeal the
20 refusal to either the district court of Polk county or the
21 district court of the county in which the seller resides.
22 8. Upon a determination that the claim is eligible for
23 indemnification, the board shall provide for payment of ninety
24 percent of the repayment loss, as determined by the board,
25 but not more than three hundred thousand dollars counting
26 the dollar value losses paid to the same grain dealer during
27 the claim period as provided in section 203D.6. If at any
28 time the board determines that there are insufficient moneys
29 in the fund to make payment of all claims under section
30 203D.6 and this section, the board may order that payment be
31 deferred on specified claims. The department, upon the board’s
32 instruction, shall hold the claims for deferred payment until
33 the board determines that the fund again contains sufficient
34 assets.
35 9. In the event of the payment of a repayment loss under
HF 999.1492 (2) 91
(amending this HF 999 to CONFORM to SF 608)
-9- da/ns 9/12

1 this section, the fund is subrogated to the extent of the
2 amount of any payments to all rights, powers, privileges,
3 and remedies of the seller against any person regarding
4 the repayment loss. The seller shall render all necessary
5 assistance to the department and the board in securing the
6 rights granted in this section. No action or claim initiated
7 by a seller and pending at the time of payment from the fund
8 shall be compromised or settled without the consent of the
9 board.
10 10. a. A repayment claim shall expire if five years after
11 the board determines that the repayment claim is eligible, and
12 the claimant has failed to do any of the following:
13 (1) Provide for the fund’s subrogation or render all
14 necessary assistance to the department and the board in
15 securing the department’s rights of subrogation as required in
