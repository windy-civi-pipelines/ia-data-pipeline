For districts approved before July 1, 2018, the area 11 consists of contiguous parcels and does not exceed twenty-five 12 acres in total. For districts approved on or after July 1, 13 2020, the area consists of contiguous parcels and does not 14 exceed seventy-five one hundred twenty-five acres in total. 15 Sec. 44. RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY. This division of this 16 Act applies retroactively to July 1, 2020. 17 EXPLANATION 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 19 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 20 This bill relates to matters under the purview of the 21 economic development authority and the Iowa finance authority 22 including the strategic infrastructure program, brownfield, 23 grayfield, and redevelopment tax credits, community attraction 24 and tourism, vision Iowa, sports tourism marketing, the 25 historic preservation tax credit, homelessness, the title 26 guaranty board, arts and culture, and the Iowa reinvestment 27 Act. 28 Division I eliminates the requirement that the Iowa 29 innovation council review and make recommendations on all 30 applications received by the Iowa economic development 31 authority (IEDA) for financial assistance under the Iowa 32 strategic infrastructure program, and instead requires a 33 committee appointed by the IEDA director to conduct a review 34 and make recommendations. 35 -17- LSB 1410SW (3) 91 nls/ko 17/ 23 S.F. 642 Division II repeals the brownfield redevelopment program, 1 fund, and advisory council (council). 2 The bill requires that the amount of a redevelopment tax 3 credit be determined by members of the IEDA appointed by the 4 governor (the board), rather than determined by the board 5 in conjunction with the council as required under current 6 law. The IEDA shall accept and review applications for the 7 redevelopment tax credit and make award recommendations to 8 the board, rather than accept and review applications in 9 conjunction with the council as required under current law. 10 The IEDA may engage outside experts to complete a technical, 11 financial, or other review. The bill makes conforming changes 12 related to elimination of the council. 13 Under current law, upon completion of a registered project 14 for redevelopment tax credits, an audit of the project 15 completed by an independent certified public accountant (CPA) 16 shall be submitted to the IEDA. Under the bill, the investor 17 shall engage a CPA to conduct an examination of the project 18 and submit the examination, and a statement of the amount of 19 final qualifying investments, to the IEDA. Upon review of the 20 examination and statement, the IEDA may issue a tax credit 21 certificate to the investor. 22 On the effective date of the bill, all unencumbered and 23 unobligated moneys remaining in the brownfield redevelopment 24 fund are transferred to a fund or funds established pursuant to 25 Code section 15.335B, as determined by the IEDA. 26 Division III eliminates the requirement that an applicant 27 awarded financial assistance under both the vision Iowa program 28 and the community attraction and tourism program provide and 29 pay at least 50 percent of the cost of a standard medical 30 insurance plan for all full-time employees after the completion 31 of the project for which financial assistance was received. 32 This division applies to applicants awarded financial 33 assistance under both programs on or after the effective date 34 of the bill, and applies retroactively to applicants awarded 35 -18- LSB 1410SW (3) 91 nls/ko 18/ 23 S.F. 642 financial assistance under both programs prior to the effective 1 date of the bill. 2 Under division IV, the director of the IEDA shall appoint a 3 review committee composed of members with relevant expertise to 4 review community attraction and tourism program applications 5 and sports tourism marketing and infrastructure program 6 applications. Under current law, the review committee is 7 composed of five members of the IEDA board. 8 Division V requires, in addition to existing requirements 9 for the historic preservation tax credit program (historic 10 tax program) under current law, for a project for the 11 rehabilitation of property to be considered a âqualified 12 rehabilitation projectâ (project), that the property not be a 13 single-family dwelling unit, unless the project will result 14 in two or more new single-family dwelling units that were 15 not available for occupancy for at least six months prior to 16 the project, and the dwelling units are located in the same 17 neighborhood as confirmed by the IEDA. The single-family 18 dwelling units must be made available for occupancy as a result 19 of the project. The IEDA may promulgate rules that specify the 20 criteria used to determine if a property is a single-family 21 dwelling unit, and to determine if a property is a qualified 22 rehabilitation project. 23 Currently, the refundability of a historic preservation tax 24 credit in excess of tax liability is gradually reduced until 25 the tax credit is 75 percent refundable for tax years beginning 26 on or after January 1, 2027. The bill strikes the gradual 27 reduction of the tax credit refundability and makes the tax 28 credit 100 percent refundable for tax years beginning on or 29 after January 1, 2026. The historic preservation tax credit 30 certificate is also currently transferable to another taxpayer. 31 The bill prohibits such a transfer to another taxpayer on or 32 after January 1, 2026. 33 Under current law, upon successful registration of a 34 project under the historic tax program, the eligible taxpayer 35 -19- LSB 1410SW (3) 91 nls/ko 19/ 23 S.F. 642 (taxpayer) shall enter into an agreement with the IEDA that 1 contains mutually agreeable terms and conditions including the 2 commencement date of the project, which shall not be later than 3 the end of the fiscal year in which the agreement is entered 4 into, and the completion date of the project, which shall be 5 within 36 months of the commencement date. Under the bill, 6 the date by which the project must commence shall be no later 7 than one calendar year from the registration date, except 8 that upon application of the taxpayer the IEDA may extend the 9 date of commencement up to 12 additional months. The date by 10 which the project must be completed shall be no later than 11 three consecutive calendar years from the registration date, 12 except that upon application of the taxpayer, the IEDA may 13 extend the date of commencement up to another 12 months. The 14 project is complete as of the date the property is placed in 15 service. Upon application of the taxpayer made prior to the 16 expiration of the 12-month extension, the IEDA may extend the 17 date by which the project must be completed up to an additional 18 12 months. The taxpayer must substantiate that the requested 19 extension is warranted due to extenuating circumstances. 20 Under the bill, the IEDA may grant historic preservation 21 tax credits beyond the aggregate tax credit award limit in one 22 fiscal year if, during that fiscal year, the IEDA receives an 23 application for a project that has qualified rehabilitation 24 expenditures that, if registered, would make the taxpayer 25 eligible for tax credits of $10 million or more. The IEDA is 26 then permitted to award tax credits during that fiscal year not 27 to exceed 20 percent more than the maximum aggregate tax credit 28 award limit. Such tax credits awarded shall be considered for 29 purposes of calculating the maximum aggregate tax credit award 30 limit in the immediately succeeding fiscal year. 31 Under division VI, the Iowa finance authority (IFA) may 32 adopt rules to carry out the duties of the IFA related to 33 homelessness, and may establish internal rules of procedure, 34 consistent with the requirements of the federal McKinney-Vento 35 -20- LSB 1410SW (3) 91 nls/ko 20/ 23 S.F. 642 Homeless Assistance Act. Under current law, the IFA must adopt 1 rules. 2 Division VII eliminates the title guaranty division board. 3 The powers of the title guaranty division relating to the 4 issuance of title guaranties are vested in the IFA board of 5 directors. The director of the IFA shall appoint an attorney 6 as director of the division, and the division directorâs 7 appointment and compensation shall be exempt from the merit 8 system. The bill makes conforming changes to Code sections 9 16.1A, 16.91, 16.92, and 16.93. 10 Division VIII is related to arts and culture. Under current 11 law, the IEDA is responsible for the Iowa cultural trust, 12 including the issuance of trust fund credits for the promotion 13 of the arts, history, or the sciences and humanities; the 14 issuance of grants for qualified organizations; developing and 15 implementing fee-based educational programming opportunities; 16 conducting surveys of existing art and cultural programs 17 and activities within the state; and the establishment and 18 administration of a film office. The bill maintains the 19 responsibility for the IEDA to accept, receive, and administer 20 grants or other funds or gifts from public or private agencies; 21 to design and carry out a comprehensive, statewide, long-range 22 plan (plan) with the assistance of the Iowa arts council to 23 develop the arts in Iowa; and to establish advisory groups for 24 the receipt of federal funds or grants or the administration 25 of the IEDAâs programs. Under the bill, the IEDA is no longer 26 required to establish and administer a film office. Instead, 27 the IEDA is responsible for providing technical assistance for 28 the production of film, television, and video projects in the 29 state. 30 The bill eliminates certified cultural and entertainment 31 districts. The bill eliminates the cultural grant programs 32 under current law, which requires the IEDA to establish 33 a grant program for cities and nonprofit, tax-exempt 34 community organizations for the development of community 35 -21- LSB 1410SW (3) 91 nls/ko 21/ 23 S.F. 642 programs that provide local jobs for Iowa residents and 1 promote Iowaâs historic, ethnic, and cultural heritages 2 through the development of festivals, music, drama, cultural 3 programs, or tourist attractions. Additionally, the IEDA 4 is required to establish a grant program which provides 5 general operating budget support to major, multidisciplinary 6 cultural organizations that demonstrate cultural and managerial 7 excellence on a continuing basis to the citizens of Iowa. 8 Instead, the bill creates the arts and culture enhancement 9 fund (enhancement fund), under which the IEDA shall allocate 10 moneys to the fund to provide support to municipal and 11 nonprofit arts and cultural organizations that serve as 12 significant attractions or community resources; to support 13 artists and entities that foster artistic and cultural 14 expression, promote lifelong learning and engagement in the 15 arts, advance community development goals, or emphasize Iowaâs 16 diverse heritage through artwork; to increase access to arts 17 and culture in rural and underserved communities; for the 18 promotion of and investment in film, television, and video 19 projects produced in the state; and to address other goals and 20 priorities in the plan designed by the IEDA. The enhancement 21 fund consists of moneys appropriated by the general assembly 22 and any other moneys that are lawfully available to the IEDA. 23 Each fiscal year, $520,000 is appropriated from gambling 24 and sports wagering taxes to the IEDA for deposit in the 25 enhancement fund. The IEDA may establish and adopt by rule 26 eligibility and priority criteria for allocation of moneys in 27 the enhancement fund. 28 The Iowa arts council (arts council) may elect a chairperson 29 and vice chairperson from the members of the arts council, 30 rather than being designated by the governor under current law. 31 In addition to duties under current law, the arts council is 32 required to recommend programs to ensure that Iowa citizens and 33 communities have access to the cultural, civic, economic, and 34 educational benefits of the arts. 35 -22- LSB 1410SW (3) 91 nls/ko 22/ 23 S.F. 642 The bill repeals Code sections 15.437 through 15.441, 15.476 1 through 15.479, 15.481, and 15.482, eliminating the Iowa 2 cultural trust Act, including the Iowa cultural trust, trust 3 fund, grant account, and board of trustees, and eliminates the 4 arts and cultural conferences and caucuses, the cultural and 5 entertainment districts, the Iowa great places program and 6 fund, and the culture, history, and arts teams program. 7 On the effective date of this division of the bill, all 8 unencumbered and unobligated moneys remaining in the Iowa 9 great places program fund, Iowa cultural trust fund, and Iowa 10 cultural trust grant account are transferred to the arts and 11 culture enhancement fund established in the bill. 12 Division IX makes conforming changes to Code sections 16.6 13 and 16.64. 14 Under division X, if in addition to meeting the other 15 requirements under current law, a district approved on or after 16 July 1, 2020, consists of contiguous parcels and no more than 17 125 acres, the district may be eligible to be designated as 18 a reinvestment district. This division of the bill applies 19 retroactively to July 1, 2020. 20 -23- LSB 1410SW (3) 91 nls/ko 23/ 23

RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY. This division of this 16 Act applies retroactively to July 1, 2020. 17 EXPLANATION 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 19 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 20 This bill relates to matters under the purview of the 21 economic development authority and the Iowa finance authority 22 including the strategic infrastructure program, brownfield, 23 grayfield, and redevelopment tax credits, community attraction 24 and tourism, vision Iowa, sports tourism marketing, the 25 historic preservation tax credit, homelessness, the title 26 guaranty board, arts and culture, and the Iowa reinvestment 27 Act. 28 Division I eliminates the requirement that the Iowa 29 innovation council review and make recommendations on all 30 applications received by the Iowa economic development 31 authority (IEDA) for financial assistance under the Iowa 32 strategic infrastructure program, and instead requires a 33 committee appointed by the IEDA director to conduct a review 34 and make recommendations. 35 -17- LSB 1410SW (3) 91 nls/ko 17/ 23 S.F. 642 Division II repeals the brownfield redevelopment program, 1 fund, and advisory council (council). 2 The bill requires that the amount of a redevelopment tax 3 credit be determined by members of the IEDA appointed by the 4 governor (the board), rather than determined by the board 5 in conjunction with the council as required under current 6 law. The IEDA shall accept and review applications for the 7 redevelopment tax credit and make award recommendations to 8 the board, rather than accept and review applications in 9 conjunction with the council as required under current law. 10 The IEDA may engage outside experts to complete a technical, 11 financial, or other review. The bill makes conforming changes 12 related to elimination of the council. 13 Under current law, upon completion of a registered project 14 for redevelopment tax credits, an audit of the project 15 completed by an independent certified public accountant (CPA) 16 shall be submitted to the IEDA. Under the bill, the investor 17 shall engage a CPA to conduct an examination of the project 18 and submit the examination, and a statement of the amount of 19 final qualifying investments, to the IEDA. Upon review of the 20 examination and statement, the IEDA may issue a tax credit 21 certificate to the investor. 22 On the effective date of the bill, all unencumbered and 23 unobligated moneys remaining in the brownfield redevelopment 24 fund are transferred to a fund or funds established pursuant to 25 Code section 15.335B, as determined by the IEDA. 26 Division III eliminates the requirement that an applicant 27 awarded financial assistance under both the vision Iowa program 28 and the community attraction and tourism program provide and 29 pay at least 50 percent of the cost of a standard medical 30 insurance plan for all full-time employees after the completion 31 of the project for which financial assistance was received. 32 This division applies to applicants awarded financial 33 assistance under both programs on or after the effective date 34 of the bill, and applies retroactively to applicants awarded 35 -18- LSB 1410SW (3) 91 nls/ko 18/ 23 S.F. 642 financial assistance under both programs prior to the effective 1 date of the bill. 2 Under division IV, the director of the IEDA shall appoint a 3 review committee composed of members with relevant expertise to 4 review community attraction and tourism program applications 5 and sports tourism marketing and infrastructure program 6 applications. Under current law, the review committee is 7 composed of five members of the IEDA board. 8 Division V requires, in addition to existing requirements 9 for the historic preservation tax credit program (historic 10 tax program) under current law, for a project for the 11 rehabilitation of property to be considered a âqualified 12 rehabilitation projectâ (project), that the property not be a 13 single-family dwelling unit, unless the project will result 14 in two or more new single-family dwelling units that were 15 not available for occupancy for at least six months prior to 16 the project, and the dwelling units are located in the same 17 neighborhood as confirmed by the IEDA. The single-family 18 dwelling units must be made available for occupancy as a result 19 of the project. The IEDA may promulgate rules that specify the 20 criteria used to determine if a property is a single-family 21 dwelling unit, and to determine if a property is a qualified 22 rehabilitation project. 23 Currently, the refundability of a historic preservation tax 24 credit in excess of tax liability is gradually reduced until 25 the tax credit is 75 percent refundable for tax years beginning 26 on or after January 1, 2027. The bill strikes the gradual 27 reduction of the tax credit refundability and makes the tax 28 credit 100 percent refundable for tax years beginning on or 29 after January 1, 2026. The historic preservation tax credit 30 certificate is also currently transferable to another taxpayer. 31 The bill prohibits such a transfer to another taxpayer on or 32 after January 1, 2026. 33 Under current law, upon successful registration of a 34 project under the historic tax program, the eligible taxpayer 35 -19- LSB 1410SW (3) 91 nls/ko 19/ 23 S.F. 642 (taxpayer) shall enter into an agreement with the IEDA that 1 contains mutually agreeable terms and conditions including the 2 commencement date of the project, which shall not be later than 3 the end of the fiscal year in which the agreement is entered 4 into, and the completion date of the project, which shall be 5 within 36 months of the commencement date. Under the bill, 6 the date by which the project must commence shall be no later 7 than one calendar year from the registration date, except 8 that upon application of the taxpayer the IEDA may extend the 9 date of commencement up to 12 additional months. The date by 10 which the project must be completed shall be no later than 11 three consecutive calendar years from the registration date, 12 except that upon application of the taxpayer, the IEDA may 13 extend the date of commencement up to another 12 months. The 14 project is complete as of the date the property is placed in 15 service. Upon application of the taxpayer made prior to the 16 expiration of the 12-month extension, the IEDA may extend the 17 date by which the project must be completed up to an additional 18 12 months. The taxpayer must substantiate that the requested 19 extension is warranted due to extenuating circumstances. 20 Under the bill, the IEDA may grant historic preservation 21 tax credits beyond the aggregate tax credit award limit in one 22 fiscal year if, during that fiscal year, the IEDA receives an 23 application for a project that has qualified rehabilitation 24 expenditures that, if registered, would make the taxpayer 25 eligible for tax credits of $10 million or more. The IEDA is 26 then permitted to award tax credits during that fiscal year not 27 to exceed 20 percent more than the maximum aggregate tax credit 28 award limit. Such tax credits awarded shall be considered for 29 purposes of calculating the maximum aggregate tax credit award 30 limit in the immediately succeeding fiscal year. 31 Under division VI, the Iowa finance authority (IFA) may 32 adopt rules to carry out the duties of the IFA related to 33 homelessness, and may establish internal rules of procedure, 34 consistent with the requirements of the federal McKinney-Vento 35 -20- LSB 1410SW (3) 91 nls/ko 20/ 23 S.F. 642 Homeless Assistance Act. Under current law, the IFA must adopt 1 rules. 2 Division VII eliminates the title guaranty division board. 3 The powers of the title guaranty division relating to the 4 issuance of title guaranties are vested in the IFA board of 5 directors. The director of the IFA shall appoint an attorney 6 as director of the division, and the division directorâs 7 appointment and compensation shall be exempt from the merit 8 system. The bill makes conforming changes to Code sections 9 16.1A, 16.91, 16.92, and 16.93. 10 Division VIII is related to arts and culture. Under current 11 law, the IEDA is responsible for the Iowa cultural trust, 12 including the issuance of trust fund credits for the promotion 13 of the arts, history, or the sciences and humanities; the 14 issuance of grants for qualified organizations; developing and 15 implementing fee-based educational programming opportunities; 16 conducting surveys of existing art and cultural programs 17 and activities within the state; and the establishment and 18 administration of a film office. The bill maintains the 19 responsibility for the IEDA to accept, receive, and administer 20 grants or other funds or gifts from public or private agencies; 21 to design and carry out a comprehensive, statewide, long-range 22 plan (plan) with the assistance of the Iowa arts council to 23 develop the arts in Iowa; and to establish advisory groups for 24 the receipt of federal funds or grants or the administration 25 of the IEDAâs programs. Under the bill, the IEDA is no longer 26 required to establish and administer a film office. Instead, 27 the IEDA is responsible for providing technical assistance for 28 the production of film, television, and video projects in the 29 state. 30 The bill eliminates certified cultural and entertainment 31 districts. The bill eliminates the cultural grant programs 32 under current law, which requires the IEDA to establish 33 a grant program for cities and nonprofit, tax-exempt 34 community organizations for the development of community 35 -21- LSB 1410SW (3) 91 nls/ko 21/ 23 S.F. 642 programs that provide local jobs for Iowa residents and 1 promote Iowaâs historic, ethnic, and cultural heritages 2 through the development of festivals, music, drama, cultural 3 programs, or tourist attractions. Additionally, the IEDA 4 is required to establish a grant program which provides 5 general operating budget support to major, multidisciplinary 6 cultural organizations that demonstrate cultural and managerial 7 excellence on a continuing basis to the citizens of Iowa. 8 Instead, the bill creates the arts and culture enhancement 9 fund (enhancement fund), under which the IEDA shall allocate 10 moneys to the fund to provide support to municipal and 11 nonprofit arts and cultural organizations that serve as 12 significant attractions or community resources; to support 13 artists and entities that foster artistic and cultural 14 expression, promote lifelong learning and engagement in the 15 arts, advance community development goals, or emphasize Iowaâs 16 diverse heritage through artwork; to increase access to arts 17 and culture in rural and underserved communities; for the 18 promotion of and investment in film, television, and video 19 projects produced in the state; and to address other goals and 20 priorities in the plan designed by the IEDA. The enhancement 21 fund consists of moneys appropriated by the general assembly 22 and any other moneys that are lawfully available to the IEDA. 23 Each fiscal year, $520,000 is appropriated from gambling 24 and sports wagering taxes to the IEDA for deposit in the 25 enhancement fund. The IEDA may establish and adopt by rule 26 eligibility and priority criteria for allocation of moneys in 27 the enhancement fund. 28 The Iowa arts council (arts council) may elect a chairperson 29 and vice chairperson from the members of the arts council, 30 rather than being designated by the governor under current law. 31 In addition to duties under current law, the arts council is 32 required to recommend programs to ensure that Iowa citizens and 33 communities have access to the cultural, civic, economic, and 34 educational benefits of the arts. 35 -22- LSB 1410SW (3) 91 nls/ko 22/ 23 S.F. 642 The bill repeals Code sections 15.437 through 15.441, 15.476 1 through 15.479, 15.481, and 15.482, eliminating the Iowa 2 cultural trust Act, including the Iowa cultural trust, trust 3 fund, grant account, and board of trustees, and eliminates the 4 arts and cultural conferences and caucuses, the cultural and 5 entertainment districts, the Iowa great places program and 6 fund, and the culture, history, and arts teams program. 7 On the effective date of this division of the bill, all 8 unencumbered and unobligated moneys remaining in the Iowa 9 great places program fund, Iowa cultural trust fund, and Iowa 10 cultural trust grant account are transferred to the arts and 11 culture enhancement fund established in the bill. 12 Division IX makes conforming changes to Code sections 16.6 13 and 16.64. 14 Under division X, if in addition to meeting the other 15 requirements under current law, a district approved on or after 16 July 1, 2020, consists of contiguous parcels and no more than 17 125 acres, the district may be eligible to be designated as 18 a reinvestment district.
