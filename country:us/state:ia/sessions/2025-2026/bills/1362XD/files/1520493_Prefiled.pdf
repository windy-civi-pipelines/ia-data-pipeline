9 EXPLANATION
10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
11 the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
12 This bill relates to matters under the purview of the
13 department of management (DOM).
14 Under current law, the governor’s budget recommendation is
15 considered confidential by the legislative services agency
16 until it is made public by the governor. The bill states that
17 information transmitted by state entities to DOM for developing
18 the budget as required by law, and documents based on the
19 transmittals, are confidential until the governor transmits the
20 budget to the general assembly.
21 The bill strikes current law providing for the use of moneys
22 in the technology reinvestment fund for certain technology
23 projects and instead appropriates moneys in the fund to DOM for
24 technology projects using factors set forth in the bill. The
25 bill requires DOM to provide a prioritized list of proposed
26 projects to the governor, who must use the list to develop
27 a budgetary recommendation to the general assembly, and to
28 report completed and ongoing projects to the general assembly
29 annually.
30 The bill increases the frequency at which a person
31 performing work for DOM or an individual on the information
32 technology staff of a supported entity may be subject to a
33 national criminal history check through the federal bureau of
34 investigation from at least once every 10 years to every 5
35 years.

1 The bill prohibits the inclusion of certain provisions in
2 information technology contracts and declares those provisions
3 void if present in such contracts. The bill also provides that
4 such contracts are deemed to include provisions requiring the
5 contract to be governed by Iowa law and litigation related to
6 the contract to be brought and maintained in Polk county. The
7 bill authorizes the director of DOM to include limitations of
8 vendor liability in information technology goods and services
9 contracts, but sets forth prohibited terms in such limitations
10 of liability.
11 The bill makes all communication concerning cybersecurity
12 between the chief information security officer and other
13 entities confidential and allows the communications to be
14 released only for specific purposes.
15 Under current law, the department of health and human
16 services serves as the Iowa statistical analysis center and
17 maintains an integrated information system for data sharing
18 among federal, state, and local governments. The bill
19 transfers these powers and duties to DOM and grants DOM access
20 to criminal justice information other than intelligence data
21 and peace officer investigative reports maintained by the
22 department of public safety. DOM is authorized to provide
23 data analysis and reporting on issues that may affect the
24 state’s correctional population and various subgroups of the
25 population, to maintain a multiagency information system to
26 track the progress of juveniles and adults charged with a
27 criminal offense through state and local agencies and programs,
28 and to count and track decision points for individuals in
29 the juvenile justice system, child welfare system, and
30 court system. If DOM lacks sufficient moneys to perform the
31 authorized tasks of the Iowa statistical analysis center, the
