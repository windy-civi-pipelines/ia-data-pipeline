5 b. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
6 contrary, the department may establish by rule a process to
7 waive or alter the work search requirements of this subsection
8 for a claim for benefits if an individual has a reasonable
9 expectation that the individual will be returning to employment

12 employment. To be considered attached to a regular job or
13 industry, an individual must be on a short-term seasonal or

19 seasonal or temporary layoff” means a layoff period of sixteen
20 weeks or less due to seasonal weather conditions or other

22 highway construction, repair, or maintenance with a specific
23 return-to-work date verified by the employer.
