15 during the individual’s base period. However, the director
16 shall recompute wage credits for an individual who is laid
17 off due to the individual’s employer going out of business at

22 base period. Benefits paid to an eligible individual shall
23 be charged against the base period wage credits in the
24 individual’s account which have not been previously charged,
25 in the inverse chronological order as the wages on which the
26 wage credits are based were paid. However if the state “off”
27 indicator is in effect and if the individual is laid off due to
28 the individual’s employer going out of business at the factory,
29 establishment, or other premises at which the individual was
30 last employed, the maximum benefits payable shall be extended
31 to twenty-six times the individual’s weekly benefit amount,
