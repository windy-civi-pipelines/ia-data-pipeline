When a dealer sells 2 beverages in eligible containers to a consumer, the dealer 3 adds the 5-cent deposit to the sale price of each beverage 4 container. A consumer can take eligible beverage containers 5 to a participating dealer or redemption center and receive a 6 5-cent refund for every eligible beverage container that the 7 consumer returns. A distributor collects eligible containers 8 from a participating dealer, dealer agent, or redemption 9 center, at which time the distributor pays the participating 10 dealer, dealer agent, or redemption center 5 cents per eligible 11 container plus a handling fee of an additional 1 cent or 3 12 cents per eligible container. 13 Upon enactment, the bill strikes the provision of the 14 beverage containers control program that requires a dealer to 15 charge a consumer the refund value for each beverage container, 16 repeals the requirement that the refund value be stated on 17 containers, and repeals provisions relating to redemption 18 center approval. Six months thereafter, the bill repeals the 19 remaining provisions of the program, including provisions 20 allowing a consumer to return beverage containers in exchange 21 for the refund value, allowing a participating dealer or 22 a person operating a redemption center to return beverage 23 containers to a distributor in exchange for the refund value 24 and handling fee, allowing refusal of beverage containers, 25 and providing for enforcement and associated penalties. Any 26 unencumbered and unobligated moneys remaining in the bottle 27 bill fund are transferred to the general fund of the state. 28 Thirty days later, any amount of refund value or handling fees 29 possessed by a distributor after the distributor has made 30 payments and fees required pursuant to current Code chapter 31 455C shall be considered the property of the distributor. 32 During the 30-day period, a distributor who pays a handling 33 fee for a beverage container that was sold for consumption off 34 the premises and that used to contain beer, including high 35 -5- LSB 1960YH (6) 91 sb/js 5/ 6 H.F. 809 alcoholic content beer, may continue to claim a refund of the 1 barrel tax as provided by current law. 2 The bill does not repeal Code section 455C.16, which 3 prohibits disposal of beverage containers in a sanitary 4 landfill by a participating dealer, distributor, manufacturer, 5 or a redemption center, or strike the associated definitions 6 in Code section 455C.1. 7 The bill amends various Code provisions to conform with 8 changes to the beverage containers control program as changes 9 to the program become effective. 10 -6- LSB 1960YH (6) 91 sb/js 6/ 6
