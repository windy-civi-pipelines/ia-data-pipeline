The bill establishes a process such 7 persons must follow before bringing such a civil action that 8 includes the submission of written complaints, opportunities 9 for the school district to remedy potential violations of 10 Code section 279.77, and written responses from the school 11 district describing actions taken. If a person has satisfied 12 all of the requirements associated with the process, the person 13 may bring a civil action, including an action for a writ of 14 mandamus, and if the person prevails, the court is required to 15 award reasonable court costs and attorney fees to the person. 16 The bill provides that the board of directors of a school 17 districtâs failure to obey orders of the court issued pursuant 18 to Code section 279.77 renders the board members who fail to 19 obey the orders of the court in contempt of the court and 20 subject to penalties provided for that offense. 21 The bill authorizes an attorney employed or retained by the 22 board of directors of a school district to request a formal 23 opinion of the attorney general or a county attorney related 24 to whether the actions taken by the school district are in 25 compliance with Code section 279.77. 26 The bill provides that Code section 279.77 shall not be 27 construed to require a school district to separately include 28 the individual components of textbooks or other instructional 29 materials that are produced as a single volume in any required 30 list; include in any required list instructional materials 31 that are used at an attendance center that is utilized by less 32 than 30 students, instructional materials that are used only 33 for individualized special education instruction as part of a 34 studentâs individualized education program, or instructional 35 -9- LSB 1865HV (2) 91 jda/jh 9/ 10 H.F. 929 materials that are used only for the instruction of a student 1 who has a plan under section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation 2 Act; or update any required list when the internet address 3 where an instructional material may be accessed no longer 4 functions or to account for people retiring or otherwise 5 discontinuing employment at the school district. 6 The bill authorizes the board of directors of a school 7 district to arrange to meet in a closed session, in accordance 8 with the stateâs open meetings requirements, to hear the 9 request of a parent or guardian of a student enrolled in the 10 school district that is related to the removal of a book, 11 article, outline, handout, video, or other educational material 12 that is available to students in the classroom or in a library 13 operated by a school district. 14 The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code 15 section 25B.3. The bill requires that the state cost of 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the 18 school district under Code section 257.16. The specification 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate 20 funding-related requirements of Code section 25B.2. The 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state 23 mandates included in the bill. 24 -10- LSB 1865HV (2) 91 jda/jh 10/ 10

This 23 specification of the payment of the state cost shall be deemed 24 to meet all of the state funding-related requirements of 25 section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional state funding 26 shall be necessary for the full implementation of this Act 27 by and enforcement of this Act against all affected school 28 districts. 29 EXPLANATION 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 31 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 32 This bill relates to school districts, including by 33 modifying provisions related to closed sessions of meetings of 34 the boards of directors of school districts and school district 35 -7- LSB 1865HV (2) 91 jda/jh 7/ 10 H.F. 929 requirements to publish information regarding the school 1 districtâs policies and procedures and educational materials 2 available to students enrolled in the school district. 3 Current Code section 279.77 requires school districts to 4 adopt a policy describing the procedures for the parent or 5 guardian of a student, or a resident of the school district, 6 to review the instructional materials used in classrooms in 7 the school district. Current Code section 279.77 defines 8 âinstructional materialsâ to mean either printed or electronic 9 textbooks and related core materials that are written and 10 published primarily for use in elementary school and secondary 11 school instruction and are required by a state educational 12 agency or local educational agency for use by students in 13 the studentâs classes by the teacher of record. The bill 14 modifies the definition of âinstructional materialsâ to 15 include any book, article, audio or visual clip, internet site, 16 digital material, or instructional handout that is assigned, 17 distributed, or otherwise presented to students in any course 18 for which students receive academic credit. 19 Current Code section 279.77 requires school districts 20 to make available on the school districtâs internet site a 21 comprehensive list of all books available to students in 22 libraries operated by the school district. The bill provides 23 this provision to require school districts to also make 24 available on the school districtâs internet site a list of 25 all instructional materials used at each attendance center 26 in the school district in the current school year, organized 27 by subject area, grade level, and teacher utilizing the 28 instructional material. The list must include the title and 29 author of the instructional material, or the organization 30 associated with the production of the instructional material, 31 and if the instructional material is accessed on the internet, 32 the internet address where the instructional material may be 33 accessed. The bill establishes other requirements related to 34 this list and alternative ways in which a school district may 35 -8- LSB 1865HV (2) 91 jda/jh 8/ 10 H.F. 929 comply with these requirements. 1 The bill provides that only the director of the department 2 of education, the attorney general, a county attorney, a 3 student, or a studentâs parent or guardian may bring a civil 4 action against the board of directors of a school district 5 to compel the school district to comply with the provisions 6 of Code section 279.77. The bill establishes a process such 7 persons must follow before bringing such a civil action that 8 includes the submission of written complaints, opportunities 9 for the school district to remedy potential violations of 10 Code section 279.77, and written responses from the school 11 district describing actions taken. If a person has satisfied 12 all of the requirements associated with the process, the person 13 may bring a civil action, including an action for a writ of 14 mandamus, and if the person prevails, the court is required to 15 award reasonable court costs and attorney fees to the person. 16 The bill provides that the board of directors of a school 17 districtâs failure to obey orders of the court issued pursuant 18 to Code section 279.77 renders the board members who fail to 19 obey the orders of the court in contempt of the court and 20 subject to penalties provided for that offense. 21 The bill authorizes an attorney employed or retained by the 22 board of directors of a school district to request a formal 23 opinion of the attorney general or a county attorney related 24 to whether the actions taken by the school district are in 25 compliance with Code section 279.77. 26 The bill provides that Code section 279.77 shall not be 27 construed to require a school district to separately include 28 the individual components of textbooks or other instructional 29 materials that are produced as a single volume in any required 30 list; include in any required list instructional materials 31 that are used at an attendance center that is utilized by less 32 than 30 students, instructional materials that are used only 33 for individualized special education instruction as part of a 34 studentâs individualized education program, or instructional 35 -9- LSB 1865HV (2) 91 jda/jh 9/ 10 H.F. 929 materials that are used only for the instruction of a student 1 who has a plan under section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation 2 Act; or update any required list when the internet address 3 where an instructional material may be accessed no longer 4 functions or to account for people retiring or otherwise 5 discontinuing employment at the school district. 6 The bill authorizes the board of directors of a school 7 district to arrange to meet in a closed session, in accordance 8 with the stateâs open meetings requirements, to hear the 9 request of a parent or guardian of a student enrolled in the 10 school district that is related to the removal of a book, 11 article, outline, handout, video, or other educational material 12 that is available to students in the classroom or in a library 13 operated by a school district. 14 The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code 15 section 25B.3. The bill requires that the state cost of 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the 18 school district under Code section 257.16. The specification 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate 20 funding-related requirements of Code section 25B.2. The 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state 23 mandates included in the bill. 24 -10- LSB 1865HV (2) 91 jda/jh 10/ 10
