1 not exceed thirty-one percent of a full-time position, on a

29 EXPLANATION
30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
31 the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
32 This bill relates to magistrate judges.
33 Under current law, a substitution of a district associate
34 judge for a magistrate must not result in lack of a resident
35 district associate judge or magistrate in one or more of the
LSB 1372XD (9) 91
-4- cm/ns 4/5
S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 counties. Under the bill, the substitution must not result in
2 a lack of at least one district associate judge or magistrate
3 appointed to serve each county. A district associate judge is
4 allowed to be appointed to serve in more than one county.
5 In addition, the bill allows a magistrate to be appointed to
6 serve in more than one county. If a magistrate is appointed
7 in more than one county, the appointment shall be made jointly
8 from persons nominated by the county magistrate appointing
9 commission of each county, with each commission following the
10 procedures set forth under current law. The bill strikes a
11 prohibition on appointing more magistrates than are authorized
12 for a county. The bill requires the supreme court to prescribe
13 a new formula for apportioning magistrates based on an
14 estimated case-related workload and to create the application
15 to become a magistrate. Under current law, the magistrate
16 appointing commission for each county creates the application
17 in addition to any form provided by the supreme court. These
18 magistrate provisions take effect January 1, 2029.
19 Until January 1, 2029, if a magistrate vacancy occurs, the
20 bill allows the chief judge of a judicial district to assign a
21 magistrate to a county in the same judicial election district
22 to the vacant magistrate position if the position cannot be
23 filled by normal appointment and if the combined weighted
24 workload of the two counties does not exceed 31 percent of a
25 full-time position.
26 Under current law, a magistrate is required to be a resident
27 of the county of appointment or a resident in a county
28 contiguous to the county of appointment. Under the bill, a
29 magistrate is instead required to be a resident of the judicial
30 election district or a county contiguous to the judicial
31 election district.

29 EXPLANATION
30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
31 the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
32 This bill relates to magistrate judges.
33 Under current law, a substitution of a district associate
34 judge for a magistrate must not result in lack of a resident
35 district associate judge or magistrate in one or more of the
LSB 1372XD (9) 91
-4- cm/ns 4/5

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 counties. Under the bill, the substitution must not result in
2 a lack of at least one district associate judge or magistrate
3 appointed to serve each county. A district associate judge is
4 allowed to be appointed to serve in more than one county.
5 In addition, the bill allows a magistrate to be appointed to
6 serve in more than one county. If a magistrate is appointed
7 in more than one county, the appointment shall be made jointly
8 from persons nominated by the county magistrate appointing
9 commission of each county, with each commission following the
10 procedures set forth under current law. The bill strikes a
11 prohibition on appointing more magistrates than are authorized
12 for a county. The bill requires the supreme court to prescribe
13 a new formula for apportioning magistrates based on an
14 estimated case-related workload and to create the application
15 to become a magistrate. Under current law, the magistrate
16 appointing commission for each county creates the application
17 in addition to any form provided by the supreme court. These
18 magistrate provisions take effect January 1, 2029.
19 Until January 1, 2029, if a magistrate vacancy occurs, the
20 bill allows the chief judge of a judicial district to assign a
21 magistrate to a county in the same judicial election district
22 to the vacant magistrate position if the position cannot be
23 filled by normal appointment and if the combined weighted
24 workload of the two counties does not exceed 31 percent of a
25 full-time position.
26 Under current law, a magistrate is required to be a resident
27 of the county of appointment or a resident in a county
28 contiguous to the county of appointment. Under the bill, a
29 magistrate is instead required to be a resident of the judicial
30 election district or a county contiguous to the judicial
31 election district.
