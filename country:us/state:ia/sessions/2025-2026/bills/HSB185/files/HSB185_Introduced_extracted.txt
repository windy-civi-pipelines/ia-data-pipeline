After the deposit has been 15 made the electric cooperative may use the electric transmission 16 or distribution easements for broadband purposes, conditioned 17 on an obligation to pay the amount of damages determined by the 18 court. 19 If the property owner is challenging the electric 20 cooperativeâs right to use the easement for broadband services 21 or infrastructure, the bill directs the district court to 22 promptly hold a hearing on the property ownerâs challenge once 23 the complaint has been answered by the electric cooperative. 24 If the district court denies the property ownerâs challenge, 25 the electric cooperative may proceed to make a deposit and make 26 use of the easement for broadband service purposes. 27 The bill requires that in an action involving a property 28 ownerâs claim for damages, the property owner has the burden 29 to prove the existence and amount of any net reduction in the 30 fair market value of the property, considering the existence, 31 installation, construction, maintenance, modification, 32 operation, repair, replacement, or removal of broadband 33 infrastructure in the easement, as well as any benefit to the 34 property from access to broadband service.

The bill 14 directs the electric cooperative to coordinate placement with 15 the relevant authority to minimize potential future relocations 16 and to notify the authority prior to placing infrastructure for 17 broadband service in an easement that is in or adjacent to that 18 authorityâs public right-of-way. 19 The bill takes effect upon enactment. 20 -6- LSB 1615YC (6) 91 sb/js 6/ 6
