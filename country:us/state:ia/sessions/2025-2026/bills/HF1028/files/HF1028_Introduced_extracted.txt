APPLICABILITY. The following apply to contracts 28 entered into or renewed on or after the effective date of this 29 Act: 30 1. The section of this Act enacting section 8.94. 31 2. The section of this Act enacting section 8.95. 32 3. The section of this Act enacting section 8.96. 33 EXPLANATION 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 35 -12- LSB 1362HZ (3) 91 sc/ns 12/ 14 H.F. 1028 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 1 This bill relates to matters under the purview of the 2 department of management (DOM). 3 The bill strikes current law providing for the use of moneys 4 in the technology reinvestment fund for certain technology 5 projects and instead appropriates moneys in the fund to DOM for 6 technology projects using factors set forth in the bill. The 7 bill requires DOM to provide a prioritized list of proposed 8 projects to the governor, who must use the list to develop 9 a budgetary recommendation to the general assembly, and to 10 report completed and ongoing projects to the general assembly 11 annually. 12 The bill increases the frequency at which a person 13 performing work for DOM or an individual on the information 14 technology staff of a supported entity may be subject to a 15 national criminal history check through the federal bureau of 16 investigation from at least once every 10 years to every 5 17 years. 18 The bill prohibits the inclusion of certain provisions in 19 information technology contracts and declares those provisions 20 void if present in such contracts. The bill also provides that 21 such contracts are deemed to include provisions requiring the 22 contract to be governed by Iowa law and litigation related to 23 the contract to be brought and maintained in an appropriate 24 state or federal court sitting in Iowa. The bill authorizes 25 the director of DOM to include limitations of vendor liability 26 in information technology goods and services contracts, but 27 sets forth prohibited terms in such limitations of liability. 28 The bill makes all communication concerning cybersecurity 29 between the chief information security officer and other 30 entities confidential and allows the communications to be 31 released only for specific purposes. 32 Under current law, the department of health and human 33 services serves as the Iowa statistical analysis center and 34 maintains an integrated information system for data sharing 35 -13- LSB 1362HZ (3) 91 sc/ns 13/ 14 H.F. 1028 among federal, state, and local governments. The bill 1 transfers these powers and duties to DOM and grants DOM access 2 to criminal justice information other than intelligence data 3 and peace officer investigative reports maintained by the 4 department of public safety. DOM is authorized to provide 5 data analysis and reporting on issues that may affect the 6 stateâs correctional population and various subgroups of the 7 population, to maintain a multiagency information system to 8 track the progress of juveniles and adults charged with a 9 criminal offense through state and local agencies and programs, 10 and to count and track decision points for individuals in 11 the juvenile justice system, child welfare system, and 12 court system. If DOM lacks sufficient moneys to perform the 13 authorized tasks of the Iowa statistical analysis center, the 14 bill allows DOM to determine which, if any, to implement. 15 The bill states that DOM is not the lawful custodian under 16 Code chapter 22 (open records) for records DOM maintains in 17 DOMâs information technology capacity for other state entities 18 as an automated data processing unit of government or when 19 held by DOM solely for storage for another department or 20 establishment. The bill requires DOM to deny requests for 21 information for which DOM is not the lawful custodian, to 22 provide assistance to the lawful custodian to comply with 23 production obligations, and to cooperate in any efforts to 24 resist associated subpoenas. 25 -14- LSB 1362HZ (3) 91 sc/ns 14/ 14

APPLICABILITY. The following apply to contracts 28 entered into or renewed on or after the effective date of this 29 Act: 30 1. The section of this Act enacting section 8.94. 31 2. The section of this Act enacting section 8.95. 32 3. The section of this Act enacting section 8.96. 33 EXPLANATION 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 35 -12- LSB 1362HZ (3) 91 sc/ns 12/ 14 H.F. 1028 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 1 This bill relates to matters under the purview of the 2 department of management (DOM). 3 The bill strikes current law providing for the use of moneys 4 in the technology reinvestment fund for certain technology 5 projects and instead appropriates moneys in the fund to DOM for 6 technology projects using factors set forth in the bill. The 7 bill requires DOM to provide a prioritized list of proposed 8 projects to the governor, who must use the list to develop 9 a budgetary recommendation to the general assembly, and to 10 report completed and ongoing projects to the general assembly 11 annually. 12 The bill increases the frequency at which a person 13 performing work for DOM or an individual on the information 14 technology staff of a supported entity may be subject to a 15 national criminal history check through the federal bureau of 16 investigation from at least once every 10 years to every 5 17 years. 18 The bill prohibits the inclusion of certain provisions in 19 information technology contracts and declares those provisions 20 void if present in such contracts. The bill also provides that 21 such contracts are deemed to include provisions requiring the 22 contract to be governed by Iowa law and litigation related to 23 the contract to be brought and maintained in an appropriate 24 state or federal court sitting in Iowa. The bill authorizes 25 the director of DOM to include limitations of vendor liability 26 in information technology goods and services contracts, but 27 sets forth prohibited terms in such limitations of liability. 28 The bill makes all communication concerning cybersecurity 29 between the chief information security officer and other 30 entities confidential and allows the communications to be 31 released only for specific purposes. 32 Under current law, the department of health and human 33 services serves as the Iowa statistical analysis center and 34 maintains an integrated information system for data sharing 35 -13- LSB 1362HZ (3) 91 sc/ns 13/ 14 H.F. 1028 among federal, state, and local governments. The bill 1 transfers these powers and duties to DOM and grants DOM access 2 to criminal justice information other than intelligence data 3 and peace officer investigative reports maintained by the 4 department of public safety. DOM is authorized to provide 5 data analysis and reporting on issues that may affect the 6 stateâs correctional population and various subgroups of the 7 population, to maintain a multiagency information system to 8 track the progress of juveniles and adults charged with a 9 criminal offense through state and local agencies and programs, 10 and to count and track decision points for individuals in 11 the juvenile justice system, child welfare system, and 12 court system. If DOM lacks sufficient moneys to perform the 13 authorized tasks of the Iowa statistical analysis center, the 14 bill allows DOM to determine which, if any, to implement. 15 The bill states that DOM is not the lawful custodian under 16 Code chapter 22 (open records) for records DOM maintains in 17 DOMâs information technology capacity for other state entities 18 as an automated data processing unit of government or when 19 held by DOM solely for storage for another department or 20 establishment. The bill requires DOM to deny requests for 21 information for which DOM is not the lawful custodian, to 22 provide assistance to the lawful custodian to comply with 23 production obligations, and to cooperate in any efforts to 24 resist associated subpoenas. 25 -14- LSB 1362HZ (3) 91 sc/ns 14/ 14
