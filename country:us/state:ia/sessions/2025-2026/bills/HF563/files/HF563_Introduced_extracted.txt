Section 441.42, Code 2025, is amended by adding the 13 following new subsection: 14 NEW SUBSECTION . 1A. A property owner may appeal the 15 assessment of any property to the board of review or a court 16 with jurisdiction over the assessed property provided that the 17 assessed property is located in a taxing district to which the 18 property owner appealing the assessment owns property of the 19 same class. Appeals made pursuant to this subsection shall be 20 made in accordance with section 441.37. 21 EXPLANATION 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 23 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 24 This bill relates to property assessment standards and 25 litigation. 26 The international association of assessing officers 27 (IAAO) is a nonprofit professional membership organization 28 of government assessment officials and others interested in 29 the administration of the property tax. The IAAO regularly 30 publishes standards related to property assessments with 31 the goal of advancing more equitable property appraisals, 32 assessment administration, and property tax policies. 33 Current law requires the director of the department of 34 revenue (director) to prepare and issue a state appraisal 35 -3- LSB 2106YH (4) 91 jm/md 3/ 5 H.F. 563 manual which each county and city assessor must use to assess 1 and value all classes of property. The bill requires the 2 director to adopt real estate property assessment standards for 3 the state appraisal manual in conformance with the standards 4 developed and published by the IAAO. Such standards must 5 include the use of the coefficient of dispersion (COD) and 6 price-related differentials (PRD). 7 COD is the measure of the spread of values about the median 8 value of a class of properties. When the difference between 9 the median value of a class of properties and the actual value 10 to sales value ratio of a property increases, the COD will 11 increase as well. CODs above a certain percentage are seen as 12 inequitable. The bill requires assessors to maintain a COD 13 of less than 15.99 percent unless there is good cause for a 14 variance. 15 PRD, or analysis of assessment bias, is used in order to 16 determine whether higher-valued properties are overvalued or 17 undervalued in relation to lower-valued properties. The bill 18 requires assessors to maintain a PRD between .98 and 1.03 19 unless there is good cause for a variance. 20 The bill requires the COD and PRD of a class of property 21 to be calculated based on comparisons of the actual value of 22 property in the same class. 23 The bill defines, for the purposes of protesting an 24 assessment, âlike propertyâ as all property within a given 25 class of property. 26 The bill limits the employment of special counsel to assist a 27 city legal department or county attorney in litigation dealing 28 with assessments to cases where the opposing party is a legal 29 business entity, including a nonprofit entity. Under current 30 law, a city legal department or county attorney may employ 31 special counsel to assist the city legal department or county 32 attorney in any litigation dealing with assessments. 33 The bill allows a property owner to appeal the assessment 34 of any other property provided that the property with the 35 -4- LSB 2106YH (4) 91 jm/md 4/ 5 H.F. 563 assessment to be appealed is located in a taxing district to 1 which the property owner appealing the assessment owns property 2 of the same class. The bill requires such appeals to be made 3 in accordance with Code section 441.37 (protest of assessment 4 ââ grounds). 5 -5- LSB 2106YH (4) 91 jm/md 5/ 5

Section 441.42, Code 2025, is amended by adding the 13 following new subsection: 14 NEW SUBSECTION . 1A. A property owner may appeal the 15 assessment of any property to the board of review or a court 16 with jurisdiction over the assessed property provided that the 17 assessed property is located in a taxing district to which the 18 property owner appealing the assessment owns property of the 19 same class. Appeals made pursuant to this subsection shall be 20 made in accordance with section 441.37. 21 EXPLANATION 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 23 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 24 This bill relates to property assessment standards and 25 litigation. 26 The international association of assessing officers 27 (IAAO) is a nonprofit professional membership organization 28 of government assessment officials and others interested in 29 the administration of the property tax. The IAAO regularly 30 publishes standards related to property assessments with 31 the goal of advancing more equitable property appraisals, 32 assessment administration, and property tax policies. 33 Current law requires the director of the department of 34 revenue (director) to prepare and issue a state appraisal 35 -3- LSB 2106YH (4) 91 jm/md 3/ 5 H.F. 563 manual which each county and city assessor must use to assess 1 and value all classes of property. The bill requires the 2 director to adopt real estate property assessment standards for 3 the state appraisal manual in conformance with the standards 4 developed and published by the IAAO. Such standards must 5 include the use of the coefficient of dispersion (COD) and 6 price-related differentials (PRD). 7 COD is the measure of the spread of values about the median 8 value of a class of properties.

CODs above a certain percentage are seen as 12 inequitable. The bill requires assessors to maintain a COD 13 of less than 15.99 percent unless there is good cause for a 14 variance. 15 PRD, or analysis of assessment bias, is used in order to 16 determine whether higher-valued properties are overvalued or 17 undervalued in relation to lower-valued properties. The bill 18 requires assessors to maintain a PRD between .98 and 1.03 19 unless there is good cause for a variance. 20 The bill requires the COD and PRD of a class of property 21 to be calculated based on comparisons of the actual value of 22 property in the same class. 23 The bill defines, for the purposes of protesting an 24 assessment, âlike propertyâ as all property within a given 25 class of property. 26 The bill limits the employment of special counsel to assist a 27 city legal department or county attorney in litigation dealing 28 with assessments to cases where the opposing party is a legal 29 business entity, including a nonprofit entity. Under current 30 law, a city legal department or county attorney may employ 31 special counsel to assist the city legal department or county 32 attorney in any litigation dealing with assessments. 33 The bill allows a property owner to appeal the assessment 34 of any other property provided that the property with the 35 -4- LSB 2106YH (4) 91 jm/md 4/ 5 H.F. 563 assessment to be appealed is located in a taxing district to 1 which the property owner appealing the assessment owns property 2 of the same class.
