NEW SECTION . 237A.13A State child care assistance 29 ââ child care workforce. 30 1. Notwithstanding any provision of section 237A.13 to 31 the contrary, a child shall be eligible for the state child 32 care assistance program under section 237A.13 if a parent, 33 guardian, or custodian meets all of the following requirements, 34 as applicable: 35 -19- LSB 1122SV (2) 91 jda/jh 19/ 26 S.F. 445 a. The parent, guardian, or custodian is employed at a child 1 care facility or child care home that has an agreement with the 2 department to accept reimbursement from the state child care 3 assistance program. 4 b. The parent, guardian, or custodian works in a child 5 care facility or child care home an average minimum of 6 thirty-two hours per week during the month in a position with 7 a primary duty of providing child care directly to children, 8 and is regularly counted in the minimum child-to-staff ratio 9 established by the department by rule. 10 c. If the parent, guardian, or custodian is employed at 11 a child care home or a child development home, the parent, 12 guardian, or custodian does not provide child care to the 13 parent, guardian, or custodianâs own child. A co-provider 14 at a child development home may qualify for state child care 15 assistance if the person meets all the requirements specified 16 in this section and by the department by rule. 17 d. The parent, guardian, or custodian is not a substitute or 18 an assistant at a child care home or a child development home. 19 e. Based on the departmentâs evaluation of the parent, 20 guardian, or custodianâs application for state child care 21 assistance, the department has determined the parent, guardian, 22 or custodian has a need for child care. 23 f. The parent, guardian, or custodian is not the owner of 24 the child care facility or child care home where the children 25 are enrolled. 26 2. A director, co-director, or other administrative 27 staff member of a child care facility may qualify for state 28 child care assistance pursuant to subsection 1 if such person 29 is regularly counted in the minimum child-to-staff ratio 30 established by the department by rule. 31 3. A person participating in the state child care assistance 32 program pursuant to eligibility established under this section 33 shall make copayments based on the personâs household income 34 for services received from the program. 35 -20- LSB 1122SV (2) 91 jda/jh 20/ 26 S.F. 445 4. The department shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A 1 to administer this section. 2 DIVISION VI 3 CHILD CARE CONTINUUM PARTNERSHIP GRANTS ââ PILOT PROGRAM 4 Sec. 40. CHILD CARE CONTINUUM PARTNERSHIP GRANTS ââ 5 PILOT PROGRAM. The department of health and human services, 6 in collaboration with early childhood Iowa area boards 7 created pursuant to section 256I.7 and the department of 8 education, shall create and administer a child care continuum 9 partnership grants pilot program. The pilot program shall 10 award competitive grants to partnerships between providers 11 of statewide voluntary preschool programming and child care 12 centers licensed pursuant to chapter 237A to provide full-day 13 early childhood education and care programming for participants 14 in the statewide voluntary preschool program created in 15 accordance with chapter 256C. The department of health and 16 human services shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A to 17 administer the child care continuum partnership grants pilot 18 program. 19 EXPLANATION 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 21 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 22 This bill relates to early childhood education and care, 23 including by modifying provisions related to the statewide 24 preschool program, the child development coordinating council, 25 programs for at-risk children, the responsibilities of 26 the department of education (DE), the early childhood Iowa 27 initiative, and the state child care assistance program, and 28 establishing the child care continuum partnership grants pilot 29 program within the department of health and human services 30 (HHS). 31 DIVISION I ââ STATEWIDE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. Under 32 current law, only school districts that meet certain 33 requirements established by the state board of education 34 are able to participate in the statewide preschool program 35 -21- LSB 1122SV (2) 91 jda/jh 21/ 26 S.F. 445 for four-year-old children established pursuant to Code 1 chapter 256C, although school districts may contract with 2 community-based providers. The bill authorizes community-based 3 providers to directly participate in the statewide preschool 4 program for four-year-old children established pursuant to 5 Code chapter 256C by applying with DE to implement a preschool 6 program. The state board is required to adopt rules to 7 further define the requirements of community-based providers 8 implementing the preschool program. 9 Under current law, state funding provided under the 10 statewide preschool program for four-year-old children is 11 provided to school districts based upon the number of eligible 12 students enrolled in the preschool programming provided by 13 the school district. Also under current law, if the school 14 district contracts with a community-based provider, state 15 funding passes from the school district to the community-based 16 provider. The bill allows a community-based provider approved 17 to directly participate in the preschool program to be paid 18 preschool foundation aid directly in the same manner as a 19 school district. The bill establishes the amount of preschool 20 foundation aid that is payable to such a community-based 21 provider for the initial school year for which the 22 community-based provider is approved to directly participate in 23 the preschool program, and for subsequent school years. 24 The bill makes conforming changes. 25 DIVISION II ââ CHILD DEVELOPMENT COORDINATING COUNCIL AND 26 PROGRAMS FOR AT-RISK CHILDREN. Current Code chapter 256A 27 establishes the child development coordinating council to 28 promote the provision of child development services to at-risk 29 three-year-old and four-year-old children. The bill strikes 30 transfers all of the responsibilities of the child development 31 coordinating council to DE and makes conforming changes. 32 Current law requires the child development coordinating 33 council to establish minimum guidelines for comprehensive early 34 child development services for at-risk three-year-old and 35 -22- LSB 1122SV (2) 91 jda/jh 22/ 26 S.F. 445 four-year-old children. Current law also requires the child 1 development coordinating council to develop an inventory of 2 child development services provided to at-risk three-year-old 3 and four-year-old children in this state that identifies the 4 number of children who are not receiving these services. 5 Additionally, current law requires the child development 6 coordinating council to encourage the establishment of programs 7 that will enhance the skills of parents in parenting and in 8 providing for the learning and development of their children. 9 Also, current law requires the child development coordinating 10 council to develop a resource directory of parent involvement 11 programs to assist districts in planning family support 12 programs. The bill strikes these provisions and does not 13 transfer these responsibilities to DE. 14 Current law requires the director of the department of 15 education to develop standards and instructional materials to 16 assist school districts in development of appropriate before 17 and after school programs for elementary school children, child 18 care services and programs to complement half-day and all-day 19 kindergarten programs, curricula for all-day kindergarten 20 programs, and curricula for the early elementary grades one 21 through three. Current law also requires the director to 22 assist prekindergarten instructors in the development of 23 appropriate curricula and teaching practices. In developing 24 these standards and materials, current law requires the 25 director to consult with the child development coordinating 26 council, the department of health and human services, the state 27 board of regents center for early developmental education, the 28 area education agencies, the department of human development 29 and family studies in the college of human sciences at 30 Iowa state university of science and technology, the early 31 childhood elementary division of the college of education at 32 the university of Iowa, and the college of education at the 33 university of northern Iowa. The bill strikes the provision 34 related to persons the director is required to consult with in 35 -23- LSB 1122SV (2) 91 jda/jh 23/ 26 S.F. 445 developing these standards and materials. 1 Current Code section 279.51(1)(b) provides that for the 2 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2007, and for each succeeding 3 fiscal year, $8,536,740 of the funds appropriated from the 4 general fund of the state to DE under Code section 279.51(1) 5 (programs for at-risk children) shall be allocated to the child 6 development coordinating council for the purposes set out in 7 Code section 279.51(2) and Code section 256A.3 (duties of 8 child development coordinating council). The bill modifies 9 Code section 279.51(1)(b) to provide that the moneys shall be 10 allocated to DE for purposes set out in Code section 279.51(2), 11 Code section 256A.3, as modified in the bill, and to be 12 used as grants to early childhood programs that demonstrate 13 the greatest need for programs for at-risk children and the 14 families of at-risk children. 15 Under current law, the moneys allocated under Code 16 section 279.51(1)(b) may be used by the child development 17 coordinating council to award grants to school districts to 18 establish programs for three-year-old, four-year-old, and 19 five-year-old at-risk children, and to provide grants to 20 provide educational support services to parents of at-risk 21 children age birth through three years. The bill modifies Code 22 section 279.51(1)(b) to provide that such moneys may be used by 23 DE to award grants to school districts to establish programs 24 for three-year-old and four-year-old at-risk children. 25 Current law requires DE to seek assistance from foundations 26 and public and private agencies in the evaluation of the 27 programs funded under Code section 279.51 (programs for at-risk 28 children), and in the provision of support to school districts 29 in developing and implementing the programs funded under Code 30 section 279.51. The bill strikes this provision. 31 DIVISION III ââ DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION RESPONSIBILITIES. 32 The bill requires the director of DE to review and conduct 33 research related to the most effective evidence-based 34 curricula, instructional materials, and evidence-based 35 -24- LSB 1122SV (2) 91 jda/jh 24/ 26 S.F. 445 or promising practices used in prekindergarten programs 1 and in preschools, and make a list of the most effective 2 evidence-based curricula, instructional materials, and 3 evidence-based or promising practices for prekindergarten 4 programs and preschools available on the DEâs internet site. 5 The bill requires the director of DE to develop a preschool 6 accountability system representing, at minimum, developmental 7 and learning outcomes and continuous implementation of 8 high-quality program standards for school districts offering a 9 prekindergarten program, accredited nonpublic schools offering 10 a prekindergarten program, prekindergarten and preschool 11 programs serving children with individualized education 12 programs, and preschool programs created in accordance with 13 Code chapters 256A and 256C. The director is also required 14 to provide, in coordination with HHS, an alignment of an 15 outcomes-based accountability system for school districts 16 offering a prekindergarten program, accredited nonpublic 17 schools offering a prekindergarten program, preschool programs 18 serving children with individualized education programs, and 19 preschool programs created in accordance with Code chapters 20 256A and 256C. 21 The bill requires the director of DE to review and revise 22 the state early learning standards and standards related 23 to preschool programs serving children with individualized 24 education programs and preschool programs created in accordance 25 with Code chapters 256A and 256C. The bill also requires the 26 director of DE to provide professional development services 27 to assist such programs in implementing the revised early 28 learning standards, preschool assessments, high-quality program 29 standards, and standards related to preschool programs. 30 DIVISION IV ââ EARLY CHILDHOOD IOWA INITIATIVE. In general, 31 the early childhood Iowa program established under Code 32 chapter 256I within HHS provides leadership for facilitation, 33 communication, and coordination for the early childhood Iowa 34 initiative activities and funding and for improvement of the 35 -25- LSB 1122SV (2) 91 jda/jh 25/ 26 S.F. 445 early care, education, health, and human services systems. 1 Current law requires the early childhood Iowa state board to 2 approve the geographic boundaries for the early childhood Iowa 3 areas throughout the state and any changes in the boundaries. 4 The bill provides that, by January 1, 2026, HHS shall designate 5 early childhood Iowa areas in the same number and using the 6 same geographic boundaries as the behavioral health districts 7 designated by HHS pursuant to Code section 225A.4 (behavioral 8 health service system ââ districts and administrative 9 organizations). The bill makes conforming changes. 10 DIVISION V ââ CHILD CARE WORKFORCE ââ STATE CHILD CARE 11 ASSISTANCE ELIGIBILITY. The bill provides that a child shall 12 be eligible for the state child care assistance program under 13 Code section 237A.13 if a parent, guardian, or custodian meets 14 certain specified requirements established in the bill. A 15 director, co-director, or other administrative staff member 16 of a child care facility may qualify for the state child 17 care assistance program if such person is regularly counted 18 in the minimum child-to-staff ratio established by HHS. The 19 bill requires a person participating in the state child care 20 assistance program pursuant to eligibility established under 21 the billâs provisions to make copayments based on the personâs 22 household income for services received from the program. 23 DIVISION VI ââ CHILD CARE CONTINUUM PARTNERSHIP GRANTS 24 ââ PILOT PROGRAM. The bill requires HHS, in collaboration 25 with early childhood Iowa area boards and DE, to create and 26 administer a child care continuum partnership grants pilot 27 program. The pilot program shall award competitive grants to 28 partnerships between providers of statewide voluntary preschool 29 programming and licensed child care centers to provide full-day 30 early childhood education and care programming for participants 31 in the statewide voluntary preschool program. 32 -26- LSB 1122SV (2) 91 jda/jh 26/ 26

An early childhood programs grant account is created in 17 the fund under the authority of the director of the department. 18 Moneys credited to the account are appropriated to and shall 19 be distributed by the department in the form of grants to 20 early childhood Iowa areas that the department determines are 21 eligible pursuant to criteria established by the state board in 22 accordance with law. The criteria shall include but are not 23 limited to a requirement that an early childhood Iowa area must 24 be designated by the state board in order to be eligible to 25 receive an early childhood programs grant. 26 DIVISION V 27 CHILD CARE WORKFORCE ââ STATE CHILD CARE ASSISTANCE ELIGIBILITY 28 Sec. 39. NEW SECTION . 237A.13A State child care assistance 29 ââ child care workforce. 30 1. Notwithstanding any provision of section 237A.13 to 31 the contrary, a child shall be eligible for the state child 32 care assistance program under section 237A.13 if a parent, 33 guardian, or custodian meets all of the following requirements, 34 as applicable: 35 -19- LSB 1122SV (2) 91 jda/jh 19/ 26 S.F. 445 a. The parent, guardian, or custodian is employed at a child 1 care facility or child care home that has an agreement with the 2 department to accept reimbursement from the state child care 3 assistance program. 4 b. The parent, guardian, or custodian works in a child 5 care facility or child care home an average minimum of 6 thirty-two hours per week during the month in a position with 7 a primary duty of providing child care directly to children, 8 and is regularly counted in the minimum child-to-staff ratio 9 established by the department by rule. 10 c. If the parent, guardian, or custodian is employed at 11 a child care home or a child development home, the parent, 12 guardian, or custodian does not provide child care to the 13 parent, guardian, or custodianâs own child. A co-provider 14 at a child development home may qualify for state child care 15 assistance if the person meets all the requirements specified 16 in this section and by the department by rule. 17 d. The parent, guardian, or custodian is not a substitute or 18 an assistant at a child care home or a child development home. 19 e. Based on the departmentâs evaluation of the parent, 20 guardian, or custodianâs application for state child care 21 assistance, the department has determined the parent, guardian, 22 or custodian has a need for child care. 23 f. The parent, guardian, or custodian is not the owner of 24 the child care facility or child care home where the children 25 are enrolled. 26 2. A director, co-director, or other administrative 27 staff member of a child care facility may qualify for state 28 child care assistance pursuant to subsection 1 if such person 29 is regularly counted in the minimum child-to-staff ratio 30 established by the department by rule. 31 3. A person participating in the state child care assistance 32 program pursuant to eligibility established under this section 33 shall make copayments based on the personâs household income 34 for services received from the program. 35 -20- LSB 1122SV (2) 91 jda/jh 20/ 26 S.F. 445 4. The department shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A 1 to administer this section. 2 DIVISION VI 3 CHILD CARE CONTINUUM PARTNERSHIP GRANTS ââ PILOT PROGRAM 4 Sec. 40. CHILD CARE CONTINUUM PARTNERSHIP GRANTS ââ 5 PILOT PROGRAM. The department of health and human services, 6 in collaboration with early childhood Iowa area boards 7 created pursuant to section 256I.7 and the department of 8 education, shall create and administer a child care continuum 9 partnership grants pilot program. The pilot program shall 10 award competitive grants to partnerships between providers 11 of statewide voluntary preschool programming and child care 12 centers licensed pursuant to chapter 237A to provide full-day 13 early childhood education and care programming for participants 14 in the statewide voluntary preschool program created in 15 accordance with chapter 256C. The department of health and 16 human services shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A to 17 administer the child care continuum partnership grants pilot 18 program. 19 EXPLANATION 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 21 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 22 This bill relates to early childhood education and care, 23 including by modifying provisions related to the statewide 24 preschool program, the child development coordinating council, 25 programs for at-risk children, the responsibilities of 26 the department of education (DE), the early childhood Iowa 27 initiative, and the state child care assistance program, and 28 establishing the child care continuum partnership grants pilot 29 program within the department of health and human services 30 (HHS). 31 DIVISION I ââ STATEWIDE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. Under 32 current law, only school districts that meet certain 33 requirements established by the state board of education 34 are able to participate in the statewide preschool program 35 -21- LSB 1122SV (2) 91 jda/jh 21/ 26 S.F. 445 for four-year-old children established pursuant to Code 1 chapter 256C, although school districts may contract with 2 community-based providers. The bill authorizes community-based 3 providers to directly participate in the statewide preschool 4 program for four-year-old children established pursuant to 5 Code chapter 256C by applying with DE to implement a preschool 6 program. The state board is required to adopt rules to 7 further define the requirements of community-based providers 8 implementing the preschool program. 9 Under current law, state funding provided under the 10 statewide preschool program for four-year-old children is 11 provided to school districts based upon the number of eligible 12 students enrolled in the preschool programming provided by 13 the school district. Also under current law, if the school 14 district contracts with a community-based provider, state 15 funding passes from the school district to the community-based 16 provider. The bill allows a community-based provider approved 17 to directly participate in the preschool program to be paid 18 preschool foundation aid directly in the same manner as a 19 school district. The bill establishes the amount of preschool 20 foundation aid that is payable to such a community-based 21 provider for the initial school year for which the 22 community-based provider is approved to directly participate in 23 the preschool program, and for subsequent school years. 24 The bill makes conforming changes. 25 DIVISION II ââ CHILD DEVELOPMENT COORDINATING COUNCIL AND 26 PROGRAMS FOR AT-RISK CHILDREN. Current Code chapter 256A 27 establishes the child development coordinating council to 28 promote the provision of child development services to at-risk 29 three-year-old and four-year-old children. The bill strikes 30 transfers all of the responsibilities of the child development 31 coordinating council to DE and makes conforming changes. 32 Current law requires the child development coordinating 33 council to establish minimum guidelines for comprehensive early 34 child development services for at-risk three-year-old and 35 -22- LSB 1122SV (2) 91 jda/jh 22/ 26 S.F. 445 four-year-old children. Current law also requires the child 1 development coordinating council to develop an inventory of 2 child development services provided to at-risk three-year-old 3 and four-year-old children in this state that identifies the 4 number of children who are not receiving these services. 5 Additionally, current law requires the child development 6 coordinating council to encourage the establishment of programs 7 that will enhance the skills of parents in parenting and in 8 providing for the learning and development of their children. 9 Also, current law requires the child development coordinating 10 council to develop a resource directory of parent involvement 11 programs to assist districts in planning family support 12 programs. The bill strikes these provisions and does not 13 transfer these responsibilities to DE. 14 Current law requires the director of the department of 15 education to develop standards and instructional materials to 16 assist school districts in development of appropriate before 17 and after school programs for elementary school children, child 18 care services and programs to complement half-day and all-day 19 kindergarten programs, curricula for all-day kindergarten 20 programs, and curricula for the early elementary grades one 21 through three. Current law also requires the director to 22 assist prekindergarten instructors in the development of 23 appropriate curricula and teaching practices. In developing 24 these standards and materials, current law requires the 25 director to consult with the child development coordinating 26 council, the department of health and human services, the state 27 board of regents center for early developmental education, the 28 area education agencies, the department of human development 29 and family studies in the college of human sciences at 30 Iowa state university of science and technology, the early 31 childhood elementary division of the college of education at 32 the university of Iowa, and the college of education at the 33 university of northern Iowa. The bill strikes the provision 34 related to persons the director is required to consult with in 35 -23- LSB 1122SV (2) 91 jda/jh 23/ 26 S.F. 445 developing these standards and materials. 1 Current Code section 279.51(1)(b) provides that for the 2 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2007, and for each succeeding 3 fiscal year, $8,536,740 of the funds appropriated from the 4 general fund of the state to DE under Code section 279.51(1) 5 (programs for at-risk children) shall be allocated to the child 6 development coordinating council for the purposes set out in 7 Code section 279.51(2) and Code section 256A.3 (duties of 8 child development coordinating council). The bill modifies 9 Code section 279.51(1)(b) to provide that the moneys shall be 10 allocated to DE for purposes set out in Code section 279.51(2), 11 Code section 256A.3, as modified in the bill, and to be 12 used as grants to early childhood programs that demonstrate 13 the greatest need for programs for at-risk children and the 14 families of at-risk children. 15 Under current law, the moneys allocated under Code 16 section 279.51(1)(b) may be used by the child development 17 coordinating council to award grants to school districts to 18 establish programs for three-year-old, four-year-old, and 19 five-year-old at-risk children, and to provide grants to 20 provide educational support services to parents of at-risk 21 children age birth through three years. The bill modifies Code 22 section 279.51(1)(b) to provide that such moneys may be used by 23 DE to award grants to school districts to establish programs 24 for three-year-old and four-year-old at-risk children. 25 Current law requires DE to seek assistance from foundations 26 and public and private agencies in the evaluation of the 27 programs funded under Code section 279.51 (programs for at-risk 28 children), and in the provision of support to school districts 29 in developing and implementing the programs funded under Code 30 section 279.51. The bill strikes this provision. 31 DIVISION III ââ DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION RESPONSIBILITIES. 32 The bill requires the director of DE to review and conduct 33 research related to the most effective evidence-based 34 curricula, instructional materials, and evidence-based 35 -24- LSB 1122SV (2) 91 jda/jh 24/ 26 S.F. 445 or promising practices used in prekindergarten programs 1 and in preschools, and make a list of the most effective 2 evidence-based curricula, instructional materials, and 3 evidence-based or promising practices for prekindergarten 4 programs and preschools available on the DEâs internet site. 5 The bill requires the director of DE to develop a preschool 6 accountability system representing, at minimum, developmental 7 and learning outcomes and continuous implementation of 8 high-quality program standards for school districts offering a 9 prekindergarten program, accredited nonpublic schools offering 10 a prekindergarten program, prekindergarten and preschool 11 programs serving children with individualized education 12 programs, and preschool programs created in accordance with 13 Code chapters 256A and 256C. The director is also required 14 to provide, in coordination with HHS, an alignment of an 15 outcomes-based accountability system for school districts 16 offering a prekindergarten program, accredited nonpublic 17 schools offering a prekindergarten program, preschool programs 18 serving children with individualized education programs, and 19 preschool programs created in accordance with Code chapters 20 256A and 256C. 21 The bill requires the director of DE to review and revise 22 the state early learning standards and standards related 23 to preschool programs serving children with individualized 24 education programs and preschool programs created in accordance 25 with Code chapters 256A and 256C. The bill also requires the 26 director of DE to provide professional development services 27 to assist such programs in implementing the revised early 28 learning standards, preschool assessments, high-quality program 29 standards, and standards related to preschool programs. 30 DIVISION IV ââ EARLY CHILDHOOD IOWA INITIATIVE. In general, 31 the early childhood Iowa program established under Code 32 chapter 256I within HHS provides leadership for facilitation, 33 communication, and coordination for the early childhood Iowa 34 initiative activities and funding and for improvement of the 35 -25- LSB 1122SV (2) 91 jda/jh 25/ 26 S.F. 445 early care, education, health, and human services systems. 1 Current law requires the early childhood Iowa state board to 2 approve the geographic boundaries for the early childhood Iowa 3 areas throughout the state and any changes in the boundaries. 4 The bill provides that, by January 1, 2026, HHS shall designate 5 early childhood Iowa areas in the same number and using the 6 same geographic boundaries as the behavioral health districts 7 designated by HHS pursuant to Code section 225A.4 (behavioral 8 health service system ââ districts and administrative 9 organizations). The bill makes conforming changes. 10 DIVISION V ââ CHILD CARE WORKFORCE ââ STATE CHILD CARE 11 ASSISTANCE ELIGIBILITY. The bill provides that a child shall 12 be eligible for the state child care assistance program under 13 Code section 237A.13 if a parent, guardian, or custodian meets 14 certain specified requirements established in the bill. A 15 director, co-director, or other administrative staff member 16 of a child care facility may qualify for the state child 17 care assistance program if such person is regularly counted 18 in the minimum child-to-staff ratio established by HHS. The 19 bill requires a person participating in the state child care 20 assistance program pursuant to eligibility established under 21 the billâs provisions to make copayments based on the personâs 22 household income for services received from the program. 23 DIVISION VI ââ CHILD CARE CONTINUUM PARTNERSHIP GRANTS 24 ââ PILOT PROGRAM. The bill requires HHS, in collaboration 25 with early childhood Iowa area boards and DE, to create and 26 administer a child care continuum partnership grants pilot 27 program. The pilot program shall award competitive grants to 28 partnerships between providers of statewide voluntary preschool 29 programming and licensed child care centers to provide full-day 30 early childhood education and care programming for participants 31 in the statewide voluntary preschool program. 32 -26- LSB 1122SV (2) 91 jda/jh 26/ 26
