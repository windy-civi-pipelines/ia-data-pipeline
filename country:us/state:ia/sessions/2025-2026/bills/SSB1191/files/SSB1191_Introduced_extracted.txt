The second offense, referred to as 9 surveillance, is committed when a person knowingly controls 10 the flight of an RPA equipped with a surveillance device over 11 either of those same locations (Code section 715E.4). In each 12 case, the applicable criminal penalty is enhanced if a person 13 has been previously convicted of either offense. For a person 14 committing intrusion, the penalty is a simple misdemeanor 15 subject to an enhanced penalty of a serious misdemeanor, and 16 for a person committing surveillance, the penalty is a serious 17 misdemeanor subject to an enhanced penalty of an aggravated 18 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement 19 for no more than 30 days and a fine of at least $105 but 20 not more than $855.

A person who owns or leases 26 a homestead or secure farmstead area may petition the district 27 court to obtain an order for a temporary injunction to prevent 28 a party from using an RPA equipped with a surveillance device 29 (Code section 715E.5). 30 BACKGROUND ââ EXCEPTIONS. Code chapter 715E prohibitions 31 do not apply in a number of circumstances based on consent by 32 the locationâs owner, operation of an RPA in compliance with 33 federal aviation administration regulations, government actions 34 in compliance with an interstate compact, the use of public 35 -5- LSB 2916XC (2) 91 da/ns 5/ 6 S.F. _____ utilities and railroads, an RPAâs high-altitude flight, the use 1 of an RPA to collect scientific information, and a governmentâs 2 exercise of a public road right-of-way. 3 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ TERMINOLOGY CHANGE. This bill replaces 4 the term âsecure farmstead areaâ, which is defined to include 5 an animal feeding operation, with the term âfarmsteadâ. The 6 bill redefines the term âfarmsteadâ to mean at least 40 7 contiguous acres of real property used for farming, subject 8 to certain conditions: (1) the real property is owned or 9 leased by a farmer, defined as a person actively engaged in 10 farming, (2) the real property is used for farming, including 11 the production of a farm commodity, and (3) at least $15,000 12 was generated from the sale of farm commodities produced on the 13 real property in the last calendar year. The bill establishes 14 a secured area of 400 feet from certain types of property 15 located on the farmstead, which includes a farm animal, farm 16 equipment, or a farm structure. However, the secured area 17 cannot include any space within the corporate limits of a city. 18 An RPA is prohibited from entering into this space, subject to 19 the exceptions that apply to a homestead. 20 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. The same right to 21 petition a district court to obtain an order for injunctive 22 relief that applies under current law to the owner or lessee of 23 a homestead or a secure farmstead area applies under the bill 24 to the owner or lessee of a homestead or farmstead. 25 PENALTIES. The same criminal offenses and penalties that 26 protect a homestead and secure farmstead area under current 27 law protect a homestead and a secure farmstead, including a 28 secure animal feeding operation, under the bill, including for 29 intrusion and surveillance. 30 -6- LSB 2916XC (2) 91 da/ns 6/ 6
