If an employer does not request a hearing pursuant 5 to subsection 2 or if the director determines, after an 6 appropriate hearing, that an employer is in violation of this 7 chapter or the rules adopted pursuant to this chapter, the 8 director shall assess a civil penalty which is consistent with 9 the provisions of subsection 1 and which is rendered with due 10 consideration for the penalty amount in terms of the size of 11 the employerâs business, the gravity of the violation, the good 12 faith of the employer, and the history of previous violations. 13 4.

The rest period is in addition to the meal period and 26 cannot be added to the meal period or deducted from the work 27 period to reduce the overall length of the total work period. 28 The bill defines an âemployeeâ as a natural person who is 29 employed in this state for wages by an employer. An âemployerâ 30 is defined as a person, as defined in Code section 4.1, who 31 employs a natural person for wages. 32 The bill provides that an employer is not required to pay for 33 a meal period if an employee is free from work duties during 34 the employeeâs entire meal period. 35 -5- LSB 2159YH (3) 91 je/js 5/ 6 H.F. 675 The bill allows three exemptions to the meal and rest period 1 requirements. The first exemption is if the meal and rest 2 period requirements are modified by the terms of a collective 3 bargaining agreement. However, the exemption is valid only 4 if the collective bargaining agreement entered into by the 5 employees prescribes specific terms concerning meal periods and 6 rest periods. 7 The second exemption states that meal and rest period 8 requirements apply to hourly paid and salary-paid employees. 9 However, management or employees involved in certain 10 agricultural jobs are not required to have breaks or meal 11 breaks. 12 The third exemption is if an employer shows that the ordinary 13 nature and circumstance of the work prevented the employer from 14 establishing and maintaining a regular scheduled meal period. 15 The bill provides civil penalties for violating the new 16 Code chapter. An employer who violates the provisions shall 17 be subject to a penalty of up to $100 for each violation. 18 The director of the department of inspections, appeals, and 19 licensing may recover the penalties under Code chapter 17A 20 contested case procedures. Any penalties recovered shall be 21 deposited in the general fund of the state. 22 The director may propose that an employer be assessed a 23 penalty by serving the employer with notice of a penalty in the 24 same manner as an original notice is served under the rules of 25 civil procedure. 26 The bill provides the director with the authority to provide 27 further exemptions from the requirements of the bill by rule 28 when reasonable. Also, the director or the directorâs designee 29 may inspect employment records relating to rest periods for 30 employees and interview an employer or employee or an agent 31 of the employer or employee, during working hours or at other 32 reasonable times. 33 -6- LSB 2159YH (3) 91 je/js 6/ 6
