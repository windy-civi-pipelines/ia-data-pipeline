Under current law, a 22 psychiatric medical institution for children (PMIC) is an 23 institution providing more than 24 hours of continuous care 24 involving long-term psychiatric services to 3 or more children 25 in residence for expected periods of 14 days or more for 26 diagnosis and evaluation, or for expected periods of 90 days 27 or more for treatment. 28 The bill exempts PMICs that do not provide substance use 29 disorder services from licensing requirements for maintaining 30 or conducting programs with the primary purpose of treating and 31 rehabilitating persons with a substance use disorder. 32 The bill defines âapproved qualifying organizationâ as 33 the joint commission, the commission on the accreditation of 34 rehabilitation facilities, the council on accreditation, or a 35 -31- LSB 1457HZ (3) 91 dg/ko 31/ 36 H.F. 984 nationally recognized accrediting organization with standards 1 comparable to the joint commission and commission on the 2 accreditation of rehabilitation facilities that are acceptable 3 under federal regulations. 4 The bill defines âmental health disorderâ as a mental 5 disorder as defined in the most recent version of the 6 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published 7 by the American psychiatric association, or a mental disorder 8 as defined in the most recent version of the international 9 classification of diseases published by the world health 10 organization. 11 The bill defines âprotective locked environmentâ as a 12 setting that prevents egress from a building or grounds as a 13 protective measure to ensure safety and security. 14 The bill defines ârecord check evaluation systemâ as the 15 record check evaluation system of HHS used to perform child and 16 dependent adult abuse record checks and to evaluate criminal 17 history and abuse records. 18 The bill defines âserious emotional disturbanceâ as a 19 diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder that 20 meets the diagnostic criteria specified in the most current 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published 22 by the American psychiatric association. âSerious emotional 23 disturbanceâ does not include a substance use disorder or 24 developmental disorder unless such disorder co-occurs with a 25 diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder. 26 The bill defines âsubstance use disorderâ as a diagnosable 27 substance use disorder of sufficient duration to meet 28 diagnostic criteria specified within the most current 29 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published 30 by the American psychiatric association that results in a 31 functional impairment. 32 The bill defines âyouthâ as a person who is less than 21 33 years of age. 34 The bill describes the nature of care a PMIC must offer youth 35 -32- LSB 1457HZ (3) 91 dg/ko 32/ 36 H.F. 984 with a serious emotional disturbance (SED), a substance use 1 disorder (SUD), or both. 2 Under current law, a person who establishes a PMIC must 3 also hold a license under Code chapter 237 (child foster 4 care facilities) as a comprehensive residential facility for 5 children, or hold a license under Code chapter 125 (substance 6 use disorders) if the facility provides SUD treatment. The 7 bill requires a person who establishes a PMIC to hold a license 8 under Code chapter 237. The person must also hold a license 9 under Code chapter 125 if the PMIC provides SUD treatment. 10 The bill eliminates the requirement that a proposed PMIC be 11 under the direction of an agency which has previously operated 12 a facility for children or adolescents and meets or exceeds 13 requirements for licensure as a comprehensive residential 14 facility for children. 15 The bill requires the department of inspections, appeals 16 and licensing (DIAL), in cooperation with the department of 17 health and human services (HHS), to adopt rules relating to the 18 application of a protective locked environment in a PMIC. 19 The bill defines âbehavioral health evaluationâ as a 20 comprehensive evaluation of a personâs mental and behavioral 21 health by a person licensed under Code chapter 154B 22 (psychology), 154C (social work), or 154D (behavioral science) 23 for purposes including but not limited to identifying a 24 possible behavioral health condition. 25 The bill defines âphysical assessmentâ as direct physical 26 touching, viewing, and medically necessary manipulation of any 27 area of a childâs body by a licensed physician. 28 The bill replaces several references to a physical or mental 29 examination with references to a physical assessment (PA) or 30 behavioral health evaluation (BHE) and replaces references to a 31 personâs abuse of alcohol or other controlled substances with 32 references to the person having a behavioral health condition. 33 Under current law, one of several specific circumstances 34 must exist before a juvenile court has the authority to enter 35 -33- LSB 1457HZ (3) 91 dg/ko 33/ 36 H.F. 984 an ex parte order to direct a peace officer or a juvenile court 1 officer to take custody of a child before or after the filing 2 of a petition under Code chapter 232 (juvenile justice). The 3 bill adds the circumstance when the childâs parent, guardian, 4 or legal custodian consents to the removal as a condition that 5 would permit a juvenile court to enter such an ex parte order. 6 The bill creates similar provisions for when a juvenile court 7 may enter an ex parte order for a child to undergo an inpatient 8 PA or an inpatient BHE and when a person authorized to conduct 9 a preliminary investigation in response to a complaint 10 may motion to ask the court to order a child to undergo an 11 inpatient PA or an inpatient BHE. 12 The bill exempts a PMIC from licensing requirements for 13 child foster care. 14 The bill directs HHS and DIAL to adopt rules relating to the 15 application of a protective locked environment to child foster 16 care licensees. 17 The bill directs HHS and DIAL to coordinate in developing 18 rules related to this division of the bill. The bill outlines 19 goals and considerations each department must take into account 20 while adopting such rules. 21 The bill requires HHS to convene a committee made of 22 representatives of several different organizations and persons 23 detailed in the bill to review the systems and related services 24 and supports available for youth, including but not limited to 25 systems, services, and supports related to civil commitment and 26 treatment, juvenile delinquency, and CINA. The bill details 27 the goal of the review and requires HHS to report the reviewâs 28 findings and recommendations to the governor and the general 29 assembly by October 1, 2025. 30 The bill makes conforming changes to Code chapters 135H 31 (psychiatric medical institutions for children) and 232 32 (juvenile justice). The bill repeals 2024 Iowa Acts, chapter 33 1161, sections 97 and 98. 34 DIVISION II ââ HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES ââ 35 -34- LSB 1457HZ (3) 91 dg/ko 34/ 36 H.F. 984 HABILITATION SERVICES PROVIDED BY A RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM ââ 1 EXCLUSION FROM CHILDRENâS RESIDENTIAL FACILITY DEFINITION. 2 The bill excludes care furnished to persons 16 years of age 3 or older by certain residential programs detailed in the bill 4 from the definition of a childrenâs residential facility. The 5 bill requires HHS to adopt rules to require that care furnished 6 at a residential program to persons under 18 years of age be 7 provided in settings separate from individuals over the age of 8 21. 9 DIVISION III ââ DIRECTOR OF JUVENILE COURT SERVICES ââ 10 CHIEF JUVENILE COURT OFFICERS. Under current law, the chief 11 juvenile court officers are appointed, terminated for cause, 12 and otherwise act under the direction and supervision of the 13 chief judge for the judicial district in which the chief 14 juvenile court officer was appointed. The bill transfers the 15 chief judgesâ authority over chief juvenile court officers to 16 the director of juvenile court services. 17 DIVISION IV ââ HAWKI ELIGIBILITY ââ PUBLIC INSTITUTION 18 INMATES. The bill defines âpublic institutionâ to mean the 19 same as defined in 42 C.F.R. Â§435.1010. 20 Current law does not permit a child who is an inmate in a 21 public institution to be eligible for the Hawki program. The 22 bill requires HHS to suspend, but not terminate, Hawki program 23 eligibility for a child in a public institution if the child 24 is otherwise eligible for the Hawki program except for the 25 childâs status as an inmate, the child was enrolled in the 26 Hawki program at the time the child was committed to the public 27 institution, and 30 calendar days have elapsed since the date 28 the child was committed to the public institution. A childâs 29 suspension of Hawki benefits must continue for the duration of 30 the childâs commitment to a public institution. 31 The bill requires the public institution to which a child 32 is committed and HHS to provide monthly reports and expedite 33 the restoration of the childâs Hawki benefits upon the childâs 34 discharge from the public institution. The bill requires HHS 35 -35- LSB 1457HZ (3) 91 dg/ko 35/ 36 H.F. 984 to adopt rules to administer the billâs provisions related to 1 Hawki benefits for children committed to a public institution. 2 DIVISION V ââ CORRECTIVE CHANGES. The bill updates 3 references to certain accrediting organizations through the 4 Code, corrects a reference throughout the Code related to 5 the citation for the definition of âreasonable effortsâ, 6 and changes the term âlegal custodianâ to the defined term 7 âcustodianâ. 8 -36- LSB 1457HZ (3) 91 dg/ko 36/ 36

Under current law, a 22 psychiatric medical institution for children (PMIC) is an 23 institution providing more than 24 hours of continuous care 24 involving long-term psychiatric services to 3 or more children 25 in residence for expected periods of 14 days or more for 26 diagnosis and evaluation, or for expected periods of 90 days 27 or more for treatment. 28 The bill exempts PMICs that do not provide substance use 29 disorder services from licensing requirements for maintaining 30 or conducting programs with the primary purpose of treating and 31 rehabilitating persons with a substance use disorder. 32 The bill defines âapproved qualifying organizationâ as 33 the joint commission, the commission on the accreditation of 34 rehabilitation facilities, the council on accreditation, or a 35 -31- LSB 1457HZ (3) 91 dg/ko 31/ 36 H.F. 984 nationally recognized accrediting organization with standards 1 comparable to the joint commission and commission on the 2 accreditation of rehabilitation facilities that are acceptable 3 under federal regulations. 4 The bill defines âmental health disorderâ as a mental 5 disorder as defined in the most recent version of the 6 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published 7 by the American psychiatric association, or a mental disorder 8 as defined in the most recent version of the international 9 classification of diseases published by the world health 10 organization. 11 The bill defines âprotective locked environmentâ as a 12 setting that prevents egress from a building or grounds as a 13 protective measure to ensure safety and security. 14 The bill defines ârecord check evaluation systemâ as the 15 record check evaluation system of HHS used to perform child and 16 dependent adult abuse record checks and to evaluate criminal 17 history and abuse records. 18 The bill defines âserious emotional disturbanceâ as a 19 diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder that 20 meets the diagnostic criteria specified in the most current 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published 22 by the American psychiatric association. âSerious emotional 23 disturbanceâ does not include a substance use disorder or 24 developmental disorder unless such disorder co-occurs with a 25 diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder. 26 The bill defines âsubstance use disorderâ as a diagnosable 27 substance use disorder of sufficient duration to meet 28 diagnostic criteria specified within the most current 29 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published 30 by the American psychiatric association that results in a 31 functional impairment. 32 The bill defines âyouthâ as a person who is less than 21 33 years of age. 34 The bill describes the nature of care a PMIC must offer youth 35 -32- LSB 1457HZ (3) 91 dg/ko 32/ 36 H.F. 984 with a serious emotional disturbance (SED), a substance use 1 disorder (SUD), or both. 2 Under current law, a person who establishes a PMIC must 3 also hold a license under Code chapter 237 (child foster 4 care facilities) as a comprehensive residential facility for 5 children, or hold a license under Code chapter 125 (substance 6 use disorders) if the facility provides SUD treatment. The 7 bill requires a person who establishes a PMIC to hold a license 8 under Code chapter 237. The person must also hold a license 9 under Code chapter 125 if the PMIC provides SUD treatment. 10 The bill eliminates the requirement that a proposed PMIC be 11 under the direction of an agency which has previously operated 12 a facility for children or adolescents and meets or exceeds 13 requirements for licensure as a comprehensive residential 14 facility for children. 15 The bill requires the department of inspections, appeals 16 and licensing (DIAL), in cooperation with the department of 17 health and human services (HHS), to adopt rules relating to the 18 application of a protective locked environment in a PMIC. 19 The bill defines âbehavioral health evaluationâ as a 20 comprehensive evaluation of a personâs mental and behavioral 21 health by a person licensed under Code chapter 154B 22 (psychology), 154C (social work), or 154D (behavioral science) 23 for purposes including but not limited to identifying a 24 possible behavioral health condition. 25 The bill defines âphysical assessmentâ as direct physical 26 touching, viewing, and medically necessary manipulation of any 27 area of a childâs body by a licensed physician. 28 The bill replaces several references to a physical or mental 29 examination with references to a physical assessment (PA) or 30 behavioral health evaluation (BHE) and replaces references to a 31 personâs abuse of alcohol or other controlled substances with 32 references to the person having a behavioral health condition. 33 Under current law, one of several specific circumstances 34 must exist before a juvenile court has the authority to enter 35 -33- LSB 1457HZ (3) 91 dg/ko 33/ 36 H.F. 984 an ex parte order to direct a peace officer or a juvenile court 1 officer to take custody of a child before or after the filing 2 of a petition under Code chapter 232 (juvenile justice). The 3 bill adds the circumstance when the childâs parent, guardian, 4 or legal custodian consents to the removal as a condition that 5 would permit a juvenile court to enter such an ex parte order. 6 The bill creates similar provisions for when a juvenile court 7 may enter an ex parte order for a child to undergo an inpatient 8 PA or an inpatient BHE and when a person authorized to conduct 9 a preliminary investigation in response to a complaint 10 may motion to ask the court to order a child to undergo an 11 inpatient PA or an inpatient BHE. 12 The bill exempts a PMIC from licensing requirements for 13 child foster care. 14 The bill directs HHS and DIAL to adopt rules relating to the 15 application of a protective locked environment to child foster 16 care licensees. 17 The bill directs HHS and DIAL to coordinate in developing 18 rules related to this division of the bill. The bill outlines 19 goals and considerations each department must take into account 20 while adopting such rules. 21 The bill requires HHS to convene a committee made of 22 representatives of several different organizations and persons 23 detailed in the bill to review the systems and related services 24 and supports available for youth, including but not limited to 25 systems, services, and supports related to civil commitment and 26 treatment, juvenile delinquency, and CINA. The bill details 27 the goal of the review and requires HHS to report the reviewâs 28 findings and recommendations to the governor and the general 29 assembly by October 1, 2025. 30 The bill makes conforming changes to Code chapters 135H 31 (psychiatric medical institutions for children) and 232 32 (juvenile justice). The bill repeals 2024 Iowa Acts, chapter 33 1161, sections 97 and 98. 34 DIVISION II ââ HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES ââ 35 -34- LSB 1457HZ (3) 91 dg/ko 34/ 36 H.F. 984 HABILITATION SERVICES PROVIDED BY A RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM ââ 1 EXCLUSION FROM CHILDRENâS RESIDENTIAL FACILITY DEFINITION. 2 The bill excludes care furnished to persons 16 years of age 3 or older by certain residential programs detailed in the bill 4 from the definition of a childrenâs residential facility. The 5 bill requires HHS to adopt rules to require that care furnished 6 at a residential program to persons under 18 years of age be 7 provided in settings separate from individuals over the age of 8 21. 9 DIVISION III ââ DIRECTOR OF JUVENILE COURT SERVICES ââ 10 CHIEF JUVENILE COURT OFFICERS. Under current law, the chief 11 juvenile court officers are appointed, terminated for cause, 12 and otherwise act under the direction and supervision of the 13 chief judge for the judicial district in which the chief 14 juvenile court officer was appointed. The bill transfers the 15 chief judgesâ authority over chief juvenile court officers to 16 the director of juvenile court services. 17 DIVISION IV ââ HAWKI ELIGIBILITY ââ PUBLIC INSTITUTION 18 INMATES. The bill defines âpublic institutionâ to mean the 19 same as defined in 42 C.F.R. Â§435.1010. 20 Current law does not permit a child who is an inmate in a 21 public institution to be eligible for the Hawki program. The 22 bill requires HHS to suspend, but not terminate, Hawki program 23 eligibility for a child in a public institution if the child 24 is otherwise eligible for the Hawki program except for the 25 childâs status as an inmate, the child was enrolled in the 26 Hawki program at the time the child was committed to the public 27 institution, and 30 calendar days have elapsed since the date 28 the child was committed to the public institution. A childâs 29 suspension of Hawki benefits must continue for the duration of 30 the childâs commitment to a public institution. 31 The bill requires the public institution to which a child 32 is committed and HHS to provide monthly reports and expedite 33 the restoration of the childâs Hawki benefits upon the childâs 34 discharge from the public institution. The bill requires HHS 35 -35- LSB 1457HZ (3) 91 dg/ko 35/ 36 H.F. 984 to adopt rules to administer the billâs provisions related to 1 Hawki benefits for children committed to a public institution. 2 DIVISION V ââ CORRECTIVE CHANGES. The bill updates 3 references to certain accrediting organizations through the 4 Code, corrects a reference throughout the Code related to 5 the citation for the definition of âreasonable effortsâ, 6 and changes the term âlegal custodianâ to the defined term 7 âcustodianâ. 8 -36- LSB 1457HZ (3) 91 dg/ko 36/ 36
