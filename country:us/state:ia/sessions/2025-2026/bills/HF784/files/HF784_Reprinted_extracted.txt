Assess the studentâs level of proficiency in mathematics 20 at least every other week and implement mathematics 21 interventions and supports. 22 b. Develop, in consultation with the studentâs parents or 23 guardians, a personalized mathematics plan that identifies 24 interventions and supports that will be used to help the 25 student achieve proficiency in mathematics. 26 c. If the student is meeting expectations related to 27 increases in the studentâs level of mathematics proficiency, 28 provide the student with small group interventions. 29 d. If the student is not meeting expectations related to 30 increases in the studentâs level of mathematics proficiency, 31 provide the student with intensive interventions. 32 3. A school district shall provide the assessments, plans, 33 and interventions described in subsection 2 to students 34 enrolled in kindergarten through grade six who are persistently 35 -2- HF 784 (3) 91 jda/jh/md 2/ 3 H.F. 784 at risk in mathematics until the student performs at benchmark 1 on the statewide summative assessment in mathematics or 2 until the student performs at benchmark on two consecutive 3 assessments administered pursuant to subsection 1, whichever 4 occurs first. 5 4. For purposes of this section, âpersistently at riskâ 6 means the student has not met the grade-level benchmark on two 7 consecutive assessments administered pursuant to subsection 1. 8 5. The state board of education shall adopt rules pursuant 9 to chapter 17A to administer this section. 10 Sec. 4. STATE MANDATE FUNDING SPECIFIED. In accordance 11 with section 25B.2, subsection 3, the state cost of requiring 12 compliance with any state mandate included in this Act shall 13 be paid by a school district from state school foundation aid 14 received by the school district under section 257.16.
