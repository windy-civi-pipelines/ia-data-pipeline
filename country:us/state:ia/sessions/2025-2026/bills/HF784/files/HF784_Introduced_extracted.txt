NEW SECTION . 279.68A Student progression ââ 8 mathematics proficiency. 9 1. Each school district shall assess all students enrolled 10 in kindergarten through grade six at least three times each 11 school year to determine the studentsâ level of mathematics 12 proficiency by administering a mathematics screener that is on 13 the list developed by the department of education pursuant to 14 section 256.9, subsection 72. 15 2. If, as the result of the assessments administered 16 pursuant to subsection 1, a school district determines that 17 a student is persistently at risk in mathematics, the school 18 district shall do all of the following: 19 a. Assess the studentâs level of proficiency in mathematics 20 at least every other week and implement mathematics 21 interventions and supports. 22 b. Develop, in consultation with the studentâs parents or 23 guardians, a personalized mathematics plan that identifies 24 interventions and supports that will be used to help the 25 student achieve proficiency in mathematics. 26 c. If the student is meeting expectations related to 27 increases in the studentâs level of mathematics proficiency, 28 provide the student with small group interventions. 29 d. If the student is not meeting expectations related to 30 increases in the studentâs level of mathematics proficiency, 31 provide the student with intensive interventions. 32 3. A school district shall provide the assessments, plans, 33 and interventions described in subsection 2 to students 34 enrolled in kindergarten through grade six who are persistently 35 -2- LSB 1874HV (2) 91 jda/jh 2/ 5 H.F. 784 at risk in mathematics until the student performs at benchmark 1 on the statewide summative assessment in mathematics or 2 until the student performs at benchmark on two consecutive 3 assessments administered pursuant to subsection 1, whichever 4 occurs first. 5 4. For purposes of this section, âpersistently at riskâ 6 means the student has not met the grade-level benchmark on two 7 consecutive assessments administered pursuant to subsection 1. 8 5. The state board of education shall adopt rules pursuant 9 to chapter 17A to administer this section. 10 Sec. 4. STATE MANDATE FUNDING SPECIFIED. In accordance 11 with section 25B.2, subsection 3, the state cost of requiring 12 compliance with any state mandate included in this Act shall 13 be paid by a school district from state school foundation aid 14 received by the school district under section 257.16. This 15 specification of the payment of the state cost shall be deemed 16 to meet all of the state funding-related requirements of 17 section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional state funding 18 shall be necessary for the full implementation of this Act 19 by and enforcement of this Act against all affected school 20 districts. 21 EXPLANATION 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 23 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 24 This bill relates to education, including by modifying 25 provisions related to mathematics instruction, practitioner 26 preparation programs, and the duties of the director of the 27 department of education (DE). 28 The bill requires the director of DE to develop and 29 distribute to schools family-centered resources to support 30 student development of mathematics knowledge at home and 31 a comprehensive state mathematics plan that is designed 32 to increase the level of mathematics proficiency attained 33 by students. The bill also requires the director of DE to 34 provide teachers who are employed by schools most in need of 35 -3- LSB 1874HV (2) 91 jda/jh 3/ 5 H.F. 784 support with evidence-based professional development services 1 related to implementing high-quality mathematics instruction. 2 Additionally, the bill requires the director of DE to develop 3 and publish on DEâs internet site a list of valid and reliable 4 mathematics screeners that may be used by teachers to identify 5 students enrolled in kindergarten through grade six who may 6 require additional instruction or support in mathematics. 7 The bill requires school districts to assess all students 8 enrolled in kindergarten through grade six at least three 9 times each school year to determine the studentsâ level of 10 mathematics proficiency by administering a mathematics screener 11 that is on the list on DEâs internet site. If, as the result of 12 the assessments, a school district determines that a student 13 is persistently at risk in mathematics, the school district is 14 required to take certain specified steps involving additional 15 assessments, the development of personalized mathematics plans, 16 and interventions. The school district is required to take 17 these steps until the student performs at benchmark on the 18 statewide summative assessment in mathematics or until the 19 student performs at benchmark on an assessment, whichever 20 occurs first. The bill defines âpersistently at riskâ to mean 21 that the student has not met the grade-level benchmark on two 22 consecutive assessments. The bill requires the state board of 23 education to adopt rules to administer these provisions. 24 The bill provides that the state board of education is 25 required to adopt rules requiring all higher education 26 institutions providing practitioner preparation to include 27 preparation in methods for teaching mathematics. The 28 bill authorizes a higher education institution providing 29 practitioner preparation to satisfy this requirement by 30 requiring students who will be teaching mathematics to 31 students enrolled in kindergarten through grade 12 to complete 32 mathematics methods coursework and demonstrate competency in 33 certain specified areas. 34 The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code 35 -4- LSB 1874HV (2) 91 jda/jh 4/ 5 H.F. 784 section 25B.3. The bill requires that the state cost of 1 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school 2 district from state school foundation aid received by the 3 school district under Code section 257.16. The specification 4 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate 5 funding-related requirements of Code section 25B.2. The 6 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the 7 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state 8 mandates included in the bill. 9 -5- LSB 1874HV (2) 91 jda/jh 5/ 5
