The bill 26 defines âself-administered hormonal contraceptiveâ as a 27 self-administered hormonal contraceptive that is approved by 28 the United States food and drug administration to prevent 29 pregnancy, including an oral hormonal contraceptive, a hormonal 30 vaginal ring, and a hormonal contraceptive patch, but not 31 including any drug intended to induce an abortion. 32 The bill provides that notwithstanding any provision of law 33 to the contrary, a pharmacist may dispense a self-administered 34 hormonal contraceptive to a patient pursuant to a standing 35 -8- LSB 2166YH (3) 91 lh/ko 8/ 10 H.F. 605 order established by the medical director of the department of 1 health and human services (medical director).

Additionally, the medical director shall 8 be considered to be acting within the scope of the medical 9 directorâs office and employment for purposes of Code chapter 10 669 (Iowa tort claims Act) in the establishment of a standing 11 order in compliance with the bill. 12 The bill requires HHS, in collaboration with the boards of 13 pharmacy and medicine, and in consideration of the guidelines 14 established by the American congress of obstetricians and 15 gynecologists, to adopt administrative rules to administer the 16 bill. 17 The bill amends prescription contraceptive coverage 18 provisions to require that a group policy, contract, or plan 19 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in the 20 state on or after January 1, 2026, providing for third-party 21 payment or prepayment of health or medical expenses, shall 22 specifically provide for payment of self-administered hormonal 23 contraceptives, prescribed and dispensed as specified in the 24 bill, including those dispensed at one time. 25 The bill also requires HHS to provide prescription 26 contraceptive coverage under the Medicaid program consistent 27 with the coverage under private insurance as provided under the 28 bill. 29 -10- LSB 2166YH (3) 91 lh/ko 10/ 10

MEDICAID COVERAGE ââ SELF-ADMINISTERED HORMONAL 7 CONTRACEPTIVES. Notwithstanding section 514B.32, subsection 8 5, section 505.34, and any other provision of law to the 9 contrary, the department of health and human services shall, 10 contractually and by administrative rules adopted pursuant 11 to chapter 17A, require under Medicaid fee-for-service 12 and Medicaid managed care administration, coverage for 13 a self-administered hormonal contraceptive as prescribed 14 by a practitioner as defined in section 155A.3, or as 15 prescribed by standing order and dispensed by a pharmacist 16 pursuant to section 155A.49, including payment for up to 17 an initial twelve-month supply of the self-administered 18 hormonal contraceptive dispensed at one time and for up to a 19 twelve-month supply of the same self-administered hormonal 20 contraceptive subsequently dispensed at one time. 21 EXPLANATION 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 23 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 24 This bill relates to the dispensing of self-administered 25 hormonal contraceptives by a pharmacist. The bill 26 defines âself-administered hormonal contraceptiveâ as a 27 self-administered hormonal contraceptive that is approved by 28 the United States food and drug administration to prevent 29 pregnancy, including an oral hormonal contraceptive, a hormonal 30 vaginal ring, and a hormonal contraceptive patch, but not 31 including any drug intended to induce an abortion. 32 The bill provides that notwithstanding any provision of law 33 to the contrary, a pharmacist may dispense a self-administered 34 hormonal contraceptive to a patient pursuant to a standing 35 -8- LSB 2166YH (3) 91 lh/ko 8/ 10 H.F. 605 order established by the medical director of the department of 1 health and human services (medical director). For an initial 2 dispensing, a pharmacist may dispense up to a 12-month supply 3 at one time of the self-administered hormonal contraceptive, 4 and for any subsequent dispensing of the same self-administered 5 hormonal contraceptive, a 12-month supply at one time. 6 Additionally, the bill prohibits a pharmacist who dispenses 7 a self-administered hormonal contraceptive in accordance 8 with the bill from requiring any other prescription drug 9 order authorized by a practitioner prior to dispensing the 10 self-administered hormonal contraceptive. 11 The bill authorizes the medical director to establish a 12 standing order authorizing the dispensing of self-administered 13 hormonal contraceptives by any pharmacist who complies with the 14 standing order and retains and submits the patientâs record to 15 the department of health and human services (HHS). 16 The standing order includes requiring a pharmacist who 17 dispenses a self-administered hormonal contraceptive under 18 the bill to: complete a standardized training program and 19 continuing education requirements related to prescribing the 20 hormonal contraceptives; obtain a completed self-screening risk 21 assessment from each patient and verify the identity of each 22 patient before dispensing the hormonal contraceptives; provide 23 the patient with certain written information; provide the 24 patient with a copy of the record of the pharmacistâs encounter 25 with the patient; and provide patient counseling. 26 The standing order would prohibit a pharmacist who dispenses 27 hormonal contraceptives under the bill from requiring a 28 patient to schedule an appointment with the pharmacist for 29 the prescribing or dispensing of the hormonal contraceptive; 30 and dispensing the hormonal contraceptives to a patient if 31 the results of the patientâs self-screening risk assessment 32 indicate it is unsafe for the pharmacist to dispense the 33 hormonal contraceptives to the patient, in which case the 34 pharmacist shall refer the patient to a practitioner. 35 -9- LSB 2166YH (3) 91 lh/ko 9/ 10 H.F. 605 The bill provides immunity for a pharmacist who dispenses a 1 self-administered hormonal contraceptive and for the medical 2 director who establishes a standing order in compliance with 3 the bill from criminal and civil liability arising from any 4 damages caused by the dispensing, administering, or use of a 5 self-administered hormonal contraceptive or the establishment 6 of the standing order provided the pharmacist acts reasonably 7 and in good faith. Additionally, the medical director shall 8 be considered to be acting within the scope of the medical 9 directorâs office and employment for purposes of Code chapter 10 669 (Iowa tort claims Act) in the establishment of a standing 11 order in compliance with the bill. 12 The bill requires HHS, in collaboration with the boards of 13 pharmacy and medicine, and in consideration of the guidelines 14 established by the American congress of obstetricians and 15 gynecologists, to adopt administrative rules to administer the 16 bill. 17 The bill amends prescription contraceptive coverage 18 provisions to require that a group policy, contract, or plan 19 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in the 20 state on or after January 1, 2026, providing for third-party 21 payment or prepayment of health or medical expenses, shall 22 specifically provide for payment of self-administered hormonal 23 contraceptives, prescribed and dispensed as specified in the 24 bill, including those dispensed at one time. 25 The bill also requires HHS to provide prescription 26 contraceptive coverage under the Medicaid program consistent 27 with the coverage under private insurance as provided under the 28 bill. 29 -10- LSB 2166YH (3) 91 lh/ko 10/ 10
