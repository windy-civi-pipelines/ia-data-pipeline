EFFECTIVE DATE. This division of this Act, being 10 deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment. 11 EXPLANATION 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 13 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 14 This bill relates to the administration of the tax by 15 the department of revenue by modifying provisions related 16 to personal income, property, sales and use, motor fuel, 17 inheritance tax, and changing tax expenditure reviews. 18 DIVISION I ââ DISCLOSURE OF TAX INFORMATION. The bill 19 specifies and updates the circumstances the department of 20 revenue (department) may disclose state tax return and audit 21 information to law enforcement. The bill also makes conforming 22 changes related to disclosure of state tax return information 23 to the treasurer of state for purposes of determining ownership 24 of abandoned property. 25 The division takes effect upon enactment. 26 DIVISION II ââ ANNUAL REPORTING. The bill strikes the 27 requirement that the department annually report to the general 28 assembly the areas of recurrent taxpayer noncompliance with the 29 rules of the department including any recommendations relating 30 to the noncompliance. 31 DIVISION III ââ PROPERTY TAX ââ EXTENSIONS. Under current 32 law, a claimant may ask the director of the department, the 33 county treasurer, or the director of the department of health 34 and human services for an extension to claim a reimbursement 35 -33- LSB 1390HV (2) 91 jm/jh 33/ 39 H.F. 976 for rent constituting property taxes in case of sickness, 1 absence, or disability. The bill strikes the director of the 2 department from involvement in the extension request by the 3 claimant. 4 Under current law, when issuing a refund for an erroneous 5 property tax paid by a taxpayer, the taxpayer must have 6 presented a claim of refund to the board of supervisors, or if 7 appealed, a claim to the property assessment appeal or district 8 court within two years of the final decision on the property 9 taxes owed. Under the bill, a taxpayer is eligible to claim 10 a refund for an erroneous tax if the taxpayer had previously 11 appealed the claim for a refund of an erroneous tax to the 12 director of revenue within two years of the directorâs final 13 decision. This provision takes effect upon enactment. 14 DIVISION IV ââ FARM TENANCY INCOME TAX EXCLUSION. 15 Currently, an eligible individual may exclude income received 16 by the individual pursuant to a farm tenancy covering real 17 property held by the individual for 10 or more years, if the 18 individual materially participated in a farming business for 19 10 or more years. The bill allows the eligible individual to 20 exclude such income under such circumstances, if the individual 21 materially participated in a farming business for 10 or more 22 years in the aggregate. The bill further specifies the term 23 âheldâ is to be determined by the holding period provisions of 24 section 1223 of the Internal Revenue Code and other federal 25 regulations which is identical to the use of the term âheldâ 26 under the farming business exclusion in Code section 422.7(13). 27 DIVISION V ââ PASS-THROUGH ENTITIES. Under current law, 28 the department may issue a notice of adjustment (adjustment of 29 tax) to a partnership or pass-through entity pursuant to Code 30 section 422.25C, and specifies that the notice of adjustment 31 is appealable pursuant to Code sections 422.28 and 422.29. 32 The bill specifies the notice of adjustment is not always 33 appealable under the circumstances provided in Code section 34 422.25. 35 -34- LSB 1390HV (2) 91 jm/jh 34/ 39 H.F. 976 The division takes effect upon enactment and applies 1 retroactively to January 1, 2024. 2 DIVISION VI ââ SALES TAX CHANGES. The bill makes changes to 3 the collection of sales taxes on building materials, supplies, 4 and equipment where an owner, contractor, subcontractor, or 5 builder is also a retailer holding a sales and use tax permit. 6 Under such circumstances, if a customer of the retailer 7 purchases tangible personal property from the retailer, the 8 bill provides that such property will not be subject to sales 9 tax if the property will be subject to sales tax at resale at a 10 later date or if the property will be subject to use tax at the 11 time the retailer withdraws the property from inventory for use 12 by the retailer in construction. The bill makes other related 13 changes to enhance the readability of the provision. 14 Under current law, a purchaser, user, and consumer of 15 taxable property or services may be authorized to remit tax 16 owed directly to the department instead of the tax being 17 collected and paid by the seller. The bill specifies that in 18 order to qualify for the direct pay tax permit such a taxpayer 19 must accrue a tax liability of more than $8,000 on a monthly 20 basis. Currently, such a taxpayer must accrue a tax liability 21 of $4,000 on a semimonthly basis in order to qualify for the 22 direct pay tax permit. 23 DIVISION VII ââ MOTOR FUEL TAXES. Under current law and 24 before July 1, 2026, the department determines the rate of 25 excise tax imposed on each gallon of ethanol blended gasoline 26 based upon the distribution percentage calculated in Code 27 section 452A.3(1)(b), and the excise tax rate imposed on each 28 gallon of biodiesel blended fuel based on the distribution 29 percentage calculated in Code section 453A.3(3)(a)(2). The 30 department determines the distribution percentage based upon 31 data from reports filed pursuant to Code section 452A.33. The 32 bill allows the department to amend the initial distribution 33 percentage due to a mistake, or if there is a late report filed 34 by a retail dealer to the department, or the distribution 35 -35- LSB 1390HV (2) 91 jm/jh 35/ 39 H.F. 976 percentage is not accurate. 1 The bill changes the due date of a biannual tax return 2 relating to electric fuel tax due in January by one day, and 3 modifies the biannual tax period by one day. 4 The bill allows a person who uses electric fuel for a 5 nontaxable purpose to provide an exemption certificate to 6 the license holder selling or dispensing the fuel, if the 7 certificate is produced by the department. 8 DIVISION VIII ââ INHERITANCE TAX ââ FUTURE CODE CHANGES DUE 9 TO REPEAL. The bill changes numerous Code sections to reflect 10 the repeal of the inheritance tax beginning for the estates of 11 decedents dying on or after January 1, 2025. However, other 12 provisions of Code chapter 450 relating to the inheritance 13 tax have not been repealed. The division takes effect upon 14 enactment and applies retroactively to the estates of decedents 15 dying on or after January 1, 2025. 16 DIVISION IX ââ LUMP SUM DISTRIBUTION OF RETIREMENT INCOME. 17 Under current law, commencing with tax years beginning on or 18 after January 1, 2023, retirement income is not subject to 19 Iowa individual income tax. However, under current law a lump 20 sum distribution from a retirement account is subject to Iowa 21 income tax under Code section 422.5(8) at a rate of 25 percent 22 of the federal tax rate imposed on the amount of the lump sum 23 distribution. 24 The bill provides that the taxation of a lump sum 25 distribution from a retirement account is also exempt from 26 state taxation by exempting the lump sum distribution for a 27 person who is disabled, or 55 years of age or older, or who is 28 the surviving spouse of an individual or is a survivor having 29 an insurable interest in an individual who would have qualified 30 for the exemption for the tax year. 31 The bill excludes the lump sum distribution exempt from 32 state taxation from being included in calculating the 33 individual income tax filing thresholds in Code section 34 422.5(2) and (3). 35 -36- LSB 1390HV (2) 91 jm/jh 36/ 39 H.F. 976 The division takes effect upon enactment and applies 1 retroactively to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2 2025. 3 DIVISION X ââ ESTIMATED TAX THRESHOLD. Under the bill, 4 a taxpayer filing a return is required to make estimated 5 tax payments if Iowa income tax liability can reasonably be 6 expected to exceed $1,000 or more. Under current law, such 7 a taxpayer filing a return is required to make estimated 8 tax payments if Iowa income tax liability can reasonably be 9 expected to exceed $200 or more. 10 The division takes effect January 1, 2026, and applies to tax 11 years beginning on or after that date. 12 DIVISION XI ââ TAX EXPENDITURE REVIEW. The bill specifies 13 that the department administering a tax expenditure (tax 14 credit) is not required to review the tax expenditure if the 15 tax expenditure has been repealed or if a zero amount of the 16 tax expenditure remains available to be awarded or claimed. 17 The bill removes four tax expenditures from tax expenditure 18 review: the Iowa fund of funds program in Code chapter 15E, 19 the wind energy production tax credits under Code chapter 476B, 20 the ethanol promotion tax credit in Code section 422.11N (Code 21 2006), and the minimum tax credit under Code section 422.11B 22 (Code 2018). The bill amends the Acts to align the review of 23 the renewable chemical production tax credit in Code section 24 2.48 with the future repeal of the renewable chemical tax 25 credit program. 26 DIVISION XII ââ LIMITATIONS ON SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS AND 27 REFUNDS AND TRANSFERS TO THE ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE FUND. The 28 bill modifies the sales and use tax exemptions (exemptions) 29 related to web search portal businesses and data center 30 businesses (data centers). The division take effect upon 31 enactment (effective date). 32 Currently, the exemptions apply to the sale of computers 33 and equipment for the maintenance and operation of a data 34 center, the sale of backup power generation fuel, and the 35 -37- LSB 1390HV (2) 91 jm/jh 37/ 39 H.F. 976 sale of electricity for use in the data center, without any 1 limitations. The bill does not change the exemptions available 2 for data centers that began operating prior to the effective 3 date. 4 The bill limits the exemptions for newly constructed data 5 centers or additions upon existing property completed on or 6 after the effective date, to the first 10 years of operation, 7 if the property is located entirely or partly within a city 8 having a population of more than 30,000. 9 The bill limits the exemptions for newly constructed data 10 centers or additions upon existing property completed on or 11 after the effective date, to the first 15 years of operation, 12 if the property is not located entirely or partly within a city 13 having a population of more than 30,000. 14 Currently, the exemptions apply from the date the initial 15 investment occurs or the initiation of site preparation 16 activities. The bill defines âinitiation of site preparation 17 activitiesâ. 18 The bill requires a data center to register with the 19 department of revenue beginning January 31, 2026, and file an 20 annual report with the department describing the backup power 21 generation fuel and electricity used to obtain the exemption, 22 and describe any other information the department of revenue 23 may require. The bill requires a data center to present an 24 exemption certificate, issued annually to the data center after 25 filing the annual report, to the retailer selling the backup 26 power generation fuel and the electricity to the data center. 27 The bill provides that a business leasing space to operate 28 a data center as a lessee is eligible to qualify for an 29 exemption. A data center includes the lease of a business 30 facility leased by an entity operating a data center at the 31 location of the data center. The bill specifies the exemptions 32 apply from the beginning date of the initial lease term. 33 After the data center exemption period expires, the bill 34 requires the portion of sales tax revenue attributable to 35 -38- LSB 1390HV (2) 91 jm/jh 38/ 39 H.F. 976 the previously exempted sale of backup power generation fuel 1 and electricity be transferred to the energy infrastructure 2 revolving loan fund in Code section 476.46A. 3 -39- LSB 1390HV (2) 91 jm/jh 39/ 39

EFFECTIVE DATE. This division of this Act, being 10 deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment. 11 EXPLANATION 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 13 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 14 This bill relates to the administration of the tax by 15 the department of revenue by modifying provisions related 16 to personal income, property, sales and use, motor fuel, 17 inheritance tax, and changing tax expenditure reviews. 18 DIVISION I ââ DISCLOSURE OF TAX INFORMATION. The bill 19 specifies and updates the circumstances the department of 20 revenue (department) may disclose state tax return and audit 21 information to law enforcement. The bill also makes conforming 22 changes related to disclosure of state tax return information 23 to the treasurer of state for purposes of determining ownership 24 of abandoned property. 25 The division takes effect upon enactment. 26 DIVISION II ââ ANNUAL REPORTING. The bill strikes the 27 requirement that the department annually report to the general 28 assembly the areas of recurrent taxpayer noncompliance with the 29 rules of the department including any recommendations relating 30 to the noncompliance. 31 DIVISION III ââ PROPERTY TAX ââ EXTENSIONS. Under current 32 law, a claimant may ask the director of the department, the 33 county treasurer, or the director of the department of health 34 and human services for an extension to claim a reimbursement 35 -33- LSB 1390HV (2) 91 jm/jh 33/ 39 H.F. 976 for rent constituting property taxes in case of sickness, 1 absence, or disability. The bill strikes the director of the 2 department from involvement in the extension request by the 3 claimant. 4 Under current law, when issuing a refund for an erroneous 5 property tax paid by a taxpayer, the taxpayer must have 6 presented a claim of refund to the board of supervisors, or if 7 appealed, a claim to the property assessment appeal or district 8 court within two years of the final decision on the property 9 taxes owed. Under the bill, a taxpayer is eligible to claim 10 a refund for an erroneous tax if the taxpayer had previously 11 appealed the claim for a refund of an erroneous tax to the 12 director of revenue within two years of the directorâs final 13 decision. This provision takes effect upon enactment. 14 DIVISION IV ââ FARM TENANCY INCOME TAX EXCLUSION. 15 Currently, an eligible individual may exclude income received 16 by the individual pursuant to a farm tenancy covering real 17 property held by the individual for 10 or more years, if the 18 individual materially participated in a farming business for 19 10 or more years. The bill allows the eligible individual to 20 exclude such income under such circumstances, if the individual 21 materially participated in a farming business for 10 or more 22 years in the aggregate. The bill further specifies the term 23 âheldâ is to be determined by the holding period provisions of 24 section 1223 of the Internal Revenue Code and other federal 25 regulations which is identical to the use of the term âheldâ 26 under the farming business exclusion in Code section 422.7(13). 27 DIVISION V ââ PASS-THROUGH ENTITIES. Under current law, 28 the department may issue a notice of adjustment (adjustment of 29 tax) to a partnership or pass-through entity pursuant to Code 30 section 422.25C, and specifies that the notice of adjustment 31 is appealable pursuant to Code sections 422.28 and 422.29. 32 The bill specifies the notice of adjustment is not always 33 appealable under the circumstances provided in Code section 34 422.25. 35 -34- LSB 1390HV (2) 91 jm/jh 34/ 39 H.F. 976 The division takes effect upon enactment and applies 1 retroactively to January 1, 2024. 2 DIVISION VI ââ SALES TAX CHANGES. The bill makes changes to 3 the collection of sales taxes on building materials, supplies, 4 and equipment where an owner, contractor, subcontractor, or 5 builder is also a retailer holding a sales and use tax permit. 6 Under such circumstances, if a customer of the retailer 7 purchases tangible personal property from the retailer, the 8 bill provides that such property will not be subject to sales 9 tax if the property will be subject to sales tax at resale at a 10 later date or if the property will be subject to use tax at the 11 time the retailer withdraws the property from inventory for use 12 by the retailer in construction. The bill makes other related 13 changes to enhance the readability of the provision. 14 Under current law, a purchaser, user, and consumer of 15 taxable property or services may be authorized to remit tax 16 owed directly to the department instead of the tax being 17 collected and paid by the seller. The bill specifies that in 18 order to qualify for the direct pay tax permit such a taxpayer 19 must accrue a tax liability of more than $8,000 on a monthly 20 basis. Currently, such a taxpayer must accrue a tax liability 21 of $4,000 on a semimonthly basis in order to qualify for the 22 direct pay tax permit. 23 DIVISION VII ââ MOTOR FUEL TAXES. Under current law and 24 before July 1, 2026, the department determines the rate of 25 excise tax imposed on each gallon of ethanol blended gasoline 26 based upon the distribution percentage calculated in Code 27 section 452A.3(1)(b), and the excise tax rate imposed on each 28 gallon of biodiesel blended fuel based on the distribution 29 percentage calculated in Code section 453A.3(3)(a)(2). The 30 department determines the distribution percentage based upon 31 data from reports filed pursuant to Code section 452A.33. The 32 bill allows the department to amend the initial distribution 33 percentage due to a mistake, or if there is a late report filed 34 by a retail dealer to the department, or the distribution 35 -35- LSB 1390HV (2) 91 jm/jh 35/ 39 H.F. 976 percentage is not accurate. 1 The bill changes the due date of a biannual tax return 2 relating to electric fuel tax due in January by one day, and 3 modifies the biannual tax period by one day. 4 The bill allows a person who uses electric fuel for a 5 nontaxable purpose to provide an exemption certificate to 6 the license holder selling or dispensing the fuel, if the 7 certificate is produced by the department. 8 DIVISION VIII ââ INHERITANCE TAX ââ FUTURE CODE CHANGES DUE 9 TO REPEAL. The bill changes numerous Code sections to reflect 10 the repeal of the inheritance tax beginning for the estates of 11 decedents dying on or after January 1, 2025. However, other 12 provisions of Code chapter 450 relating to the inheritance 13 tax have not been repealed. The division takes effect upon 14 enactment and applies retroactively to the estates of decedents 15 dying on or after January 1, 2025. 16 DIVISION IX ââ LUMP SUM DISTRIBUTION OF RETIREMENT INCOME. 17 Under current law, commencing with tax years beginning on or 18 after January 1, 2023, retirement income is not subject to 19 Iowa individual income tax. However, under current law a lump 20 sum distribution from a retirement account is subject to Iowa 21 income tax under Code section 422.5(8) at a rate of 25 percent 22 of the federal tax rate imposed on the amount of the lump sum 23 distribution. 24 The bill provides that the taxation of a lump sum 25 distribution from a retirement account is also exempt from 26 state taxation by exempting the lump sum distribution for a 27 person who is disabled, or 55 years of age or older, or who is 28 the surviving spouse of an individual or is a survivor having 29 an insurable interest in an individual who would have qualified 30 for the exemption for the tax year. 31 The bill excludes the lump sum distribution exempt from 32 state taxation from being included in calculating the 33 individual income tax filing thresholds in Code section 34 422.5(2) and (3). 35 -36- LSB 1390HV (2) 91 jm/jh 36/ 39 H.F. 976 The division takes effect upon enactment and applies 1 retroactively to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2 2025. 3 DIVISION X ââ ESTIMATED TAX THRESHOLD. Under the bill, 4 a taxpayer filing a return is required to make estimated 5 tax payments if Iowa income tax liability can reasonably be 6 expected to exceed $1,000 or more. Under current law, such 7 a taxpayer filing a return is required to make estimated 8 tax payments if Iowa income tax liability can reasonably be 9 expected to exceed $200 or more. 10 The division takes effect January 1, 2026, and applies to tax 11 years beginning on or after that date. 12 DIVISION XI ââ TAX EXPENDITURE REVIEW. The bill specifies 13 that the department administering a tax expenditure (tax 14 credit) is not required to review the tax expenditure if the 15 tax expenditure has been repealed or if a zero amount of the 16 tax expenditure remains available to be awarded or claimed. 17 The bill removes four tax expenditures from tax expenditure 18 review: the Iowa fund of funds program in Code chapter 15E, 19 the wind energy production tax credits under Code chapter 476B, 20 the ethanol promotion tax credit in Code section 422.11N (Code 21 2006), and the minimum tax credit under Code section 422.11B 22 (Code 2018). The bill amends the Acts to align the review of 23 the renewable chemical production tax credit in Code section 24 2.48 with the future repeal of the renewable chemical tax 25 credit program. 26 DIVISION XII ââ LIMITATIONS ON SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS AND 27 REFUNDS AND TRANSFERS TO THE ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE FUND. The 28 bill modifies the sales and use tax exemptions (exemptions) 29 related to web search portal businesses and data center 30 businesses (data centers). The division take effect upon 31 enactment (effective date). 32 Currently, the exemptions apply to the sale of computers 33 and equipment for the maintenance and operation of a data 34 center, the sale of backup power generation fuel, and the 35 -37- LSB 1390HV (2) 91 jm/jh 37/ 39 H.F. 976 sale of electricity for use in the data center, without any 1 limitations. The bill does not change the exemptions available 2 for data centers that began operating prior to the effective 3 date. 4 The bill limits the exemptions for newly constructed data 5 centers or additions upon existing property completed on or 6 after the effective date, to the first 10 years of operation, 7 if the property is located entirely or partly within a city 8 having a population of more than 30,000. 9 The bill limits the exemptions for newly constructed data 10 centers or additions upon existing property completed on or 11 after the effective date, to the first 15 years of operation, 12 if the property is not located entirely or partly within a city 13 having a population of more than 30,000. 14 Currently, the exemptions apply from the date the initial 15 investment occurs or the initiation of site preparation 16 activities. The bill defines âinitiation of site preparation 17 activitiesâ. 18 The bill requires a data center to register with the 19 department of revenue beginning January 31, 2026, and file an 20 annual report with the department describing the backup power 21 generation fuel and electricity used to obtain the exemption, 22 and describe any other information the department of revenue 23 may require. The bill requires a data center to present an 24 exemption certificate, issued annually to the data center after 25 filing the annual report, to the retailer selling the backup 26 power generation fuel and the electricity to the data center. 27 The bill provides that a business leasing space to operate 28 a data center as a lessee is eligible to qualify for an 29 exemption. A data center includes the lease of a business 30 facility leased by an entity operating a data center at the 31 location of the data center. The bill specifies the exemptions 32 apply from the beginning date of the initial lease term. 33 After the data center exemption period expires, the bill 34 requires the portion of sales tax revenue attributable to 35 -38- LSB 1390HV (2) 91 jm/jh 38/ 39 H.F. 976 the previously exempted sale of backup power generation fuel 1 and electricity be transferred to the energy infrastructure 2 revolving loan fund in Code section 476.46A. 3 -39- LSB 1390HV (2) 91 jm/jh 39/ 39
