The commission may use the interest and earnings 11 on the moneys in the fund for administrative costs.

The commission, in coordination with 15 HHS, shall adopt rules to administer the incentive program. 16 The division shall take effect upon enactment. 17 DIVISION V. This division eliminates certain health 18 care-related grant, residency, and fellowship programs. 19 Current law provides that the fulfilling Iowaâs need for 20 dentists matching grant program may receive moneys through the 21 health care workforce shortage fund or the fulfilling Iowaâs 22 need for dentists matching grant program account (Code section 23 135.175).

The initiative provides for the 26 coordination and support of various efforts to address the 27 health care workforce shortage in the state. 28 Additionally, the medical residency training state matching 29 grants program (Code section 135.176) is eliminated. The 30 program provides matching state funding to sponsors of 31 accredited graduate medical education residency programs in 32 the state to establish, expand, or support medical residency 33 training programs. 34 The nurse residency state matching grants program (Code 35 -37- LSB 1555HV (3) 91 lh/ko 37/ 40 H.F. 754 section 135.178) is also eliminated. The program provides 1 matching state funding to sponsors of nurse residency programs 2 in the state to establish, expand, or support nurse residency 3 programs. 4 Moreover, the state-funded family medicine obstetrics 5 fellowship program (Code section 135.193) is eliminated. The 6 program provides funding for fellowships to increase access 7 to family medicine obstetrics practitioners in rural and 8 underserved areas of the state. 9 For all of the programs eliminated in the division, HHS is 10 required to provide matching state funding and fund residency 11 and fellowship positions awarded on or before June 30, 2025, as 12 detailed in the bill. All unencumbered and unobligated moneys 13 related to the programs eliminated in the division shall be 14 transferred to HHS to fund Medicaid graduate medical education 15 efforts. 16 HHS shall create accounts for the deposit of encumbered and 17 obligated moneys for each eliminated program as detailed in the 18 division. Upon the expiration of all grant, residency, and 19 fellowship periods, any unencumbered and unobligated moneys in 20 the account shall be appropriated to HHS for Medicaid graduate 21 medical education efforts. 22 DIVISION VI. This division eliminates the state-funded 23 psychiatry residency and fellowship positions (positions) 24 (Code section 135.180) administered by the university of 25 Iowa hospitals and clinics (U of I). The positions provide 26 financial support for up to seven residents and up to two 27 fellows annually. The board of regents (regents) shall direct 28 the U of I to distribute moneys for positions approved and 29 awarded on or before June 30, 2025, until all residents and 30 fellows have completed or left the positions. The regents must 31 also direct the U of I to create an account for the deposit 32 of moneys encumbered and obligated relating to the positions. 33 Upon the expiration of all residency and fellowship periods, 34 any unencumbered and unobligated moneys in the account shall 35 -38- LSB 1555HV (3) 91 lh/ko 38/ 40 H.F. 754 be appropriated to HHS for Medicaid graduate medical education 1 efforts. Any unobligated or unencumbered moneys in the 2 psychiatry residency and fellowship positions fund are also 3 appropriated to HHS to fund Medicaid graduate medical education 4 efforts. 5 DIVISION VII. This division eliminates the health 6 facilities council, and transfers the councilâs duties to HHS. 7 DIVISION VIII. This division makes conforming changes 8 to the Code related to the elimination of health facilities 9 council and the transfer of the applicable Code sections. 10 DIVISION IX. This division eliminates the board of 11 directors (board) that governs and administers the Iowa 12 health information network (network) and transfers the boardâs 13 administrative duties to the designated entity. Current law 14 requires the designated entity to be a nonprofit corporation. 15 The bill eliminates the requirement that the corporation be 16 nonprofit. The division creates an exchange advisory committee 17 (committee), appointed by the director of HHS, to govern the 18 network and the designated entity. The division requires 19 HHS to conduct a competitive process every eight years to 20 select a designated entity. Current law prohibits a single 21 industry from being disproportionately represented as voting 22 members of the board, and requires the director of HHS and the 23 director of the Medicaid program or the directorsâ designees 24 to act as voting members. The commissioner of insurance is 25 required to serve on the board as a nonvoting member, and 26 individuals serving in a nonvoting capacity on the board are 27 not included in the total number of authorized members on 28 the board. The division strikes these member requirements. 29 Current law requires the board to ensure the designated entity 30 enters into contracts with each state agency necessary for 31 state reporting requirements, and to develop, implement, and 32 enforce a single patient identifier or alternative mechanism to 33 share secure patient information that is utilized by all health 34 care professionals. The division eliminates these duties for 35 -39- LSB 1555HV (3) 91 lh/ko 39/ 40 H.F. 754 the committee. The division requires the committee to advise 1 HHS regarding the needs relating to the exchange of health 2 information, and to ensure HHS develops, and the designated 3 entity complies with, the standards, requirements, policies, 4 and procedures related to the network. 5 -40- LSB 1555HV (3) 91 lh/ko 40/ 40

The commission, in coordination with 15 HHS, shall adopt rules to administer the incentive program. 16 The division shall take effect upon enactment. 17 DIVISION V.

The initiative provides for the 26 coordination and support of various efforts to address the 27 health care workforce shortage in the state. 28 Additionally, the medical residency training state matching 29 grants program (Code section 135.176) is eliminated. The 30 program provides matching state funding to sponsors of 31 accredited graduate medical education residency programs in 32 the state to establish, expand, or support medical residency 33 training programs. 34 The nurse residency state matching grants program (Code 35 -37- LSB 1555HV (3) 91 lh/ko 37/ 40 H.F. 754 section 135.178) is also eliminated. The program provides 1 matching state funding to sponsors of nurse residency programs 2 in the state to establish, expand, or support nurse residency 3 programs. 4 Moreover, the state-funded family medicine obstetrics 5 fellowship program (Code section 135.193) is eliminated. The 6 program provides funding for fellowships to increase access 7 to family medicine obstetrics practitioners in rural and 8 underserved areas of the state. 9 For all of the programs eliminated in the division, HHS is 10 required to provide matching state funding and fund residency 11 and fellowship positions awarded on or before June 30, 2025, as 12 detailed in the bill. All unencumbered and unobligated moneys 13 related to the programs eliminated in the division shall be 14 transferred to HHS to fund Medicaid graduate medical education 15 efforts. 16 HHS shall create accounts for the deposit of encumbered and 17 obligated moneys for each eliminated program as detailed in the 18 division. Upon the expiration of all grant, residency, and 19 fellowship periods, any unencumbered and unobligated moneys in 20 the account shall be appropriated to HHS for Medicaid graduate 21 medical education efforts. 22 DIVISION VI. This division eliminates the state-funded 23 psychiatry residency and fellowship positions (positions) 24 (Code section 135.180) administered by the university of 25 Iowa hospitals and clinics (U of I). The positions provide 26 financial support for up to seven residents and up to two 27 fellows annually.

Any unobligated or unencumbered moneys in the 2 psychiatry residency and fellowship positions fund are also 3 appropriated to HHS to fund Medicaid graduate medical education 4 efforts. 5 DIVISION VII. This division eliminates the health 6 facilities council, and transfers the councilâs duties to HHS. 7 DIVISION VIII. This division makes conforming changes 8 to the Code related to the elimination of health facilities 9 council and the transfer of the applicable Code sections. 10 DIVISION IX. This division eliminates the board of 11 directors (board) that governs and administers the Iowa 12 health information network (network) and transfers the boardâs 13 administrative duties to the designated entity. Current law 14 requires the designated entity to be a nonprofit corporation. 15 The bill eliminates the requirement that the corporation be 16 nonprofit. The division creates an exchange advisory committee 17 (committee), appointed by the director of HHS, to govern the 18 network and the designated entity. The division requires 19 HHS to conduct a competitive process every eight years to 20 select a designated entity. Current law prohibits a single 21 industry from being disproportionately represented as voting 22 members of the board, and requires the director of HHS and the 23 director of the Medicaid program or the directorsâ designees 24 to act as voting members. The commissioner of insurance is 25 required to serve on the board as a nonvoting member, and 26 individuals serving in a nonvoting capacity on the board are 27 not included in the total number of authorized members on 28 the board. The division strikes these member requirements. 29 Current law requires the board to ensure the designated entity 30 enters into contracts with each state agency necessary for 31 state reporting requirements, and to develop, implement, and 32 enforce a single patient identifier or alternative mechanism to 33 share secure patient information that is utilized by all health 34 care professionals. The division eliminates these duties for 35 -39- LSB 1555HV (3) 91 lh/ko 39/ 40 H.F. 754 the committee.
