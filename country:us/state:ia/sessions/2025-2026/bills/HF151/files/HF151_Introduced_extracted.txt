This bill amends Code chapter 466B, which provides 20 for a number of programs to protect surface water and provide 21 for flood mitigation and watershed management. The bill 22 creates a new Code subchapter which requires a landowner having 23 an interest in property adjoining a public water source (e.g., 24 a watercourse such as a river, stream, or drainage ditch; or a 25 body of water such as a pond, lake, or reservoir) to establish 26 and maintain a riparian protection measure (measure) in 27 compliance with a riparian protection compliance plan (plan). 28 The plan is derived from a riparian protection inventory and 29 map developed by the department of natural resources (DNR). 30 ADMINISTRATION. The plan must be prepared by the landowner 31 and approved by the division of soil conservation and water 32 quality (division) of the department of agriculture and 33 land stewardship. The division must act in partnership 34 with commissioners of soil and water conservation districts 35 -13- LSB 1895YH (4) 91 da/ns 13/ 15 H.F. 151 (commissioners), and in cooperation with a number of other 1 government entities, including the state soil conservation 2 and water quality committee, the water resources coordinating 3 council, and DNR. 4 REQUIREMENTS. Under an approved plan, a landowner must 5 establish and maintain a measure which is either a riparian 6 protection buffer consisting of perennial vegetation, or an 7 alternative riparian protection practice (e.g., erosion control 8 practice or soil and water conservation practice) alone or in 9 combination with a modified riparian protection buffer. The 10 landowner must establish and maintain the measure after the 11 division completes a riparian protection inventory and map 12 which identifies the land subject to riparian protection. A 13 landowner may apply for financial assistance to establish a 14 measure under a number of programs, including cost-share moneys 15 awarded under the authority of the division. 16 EXCEPTIONS. The bill creates a number of exceptions that 17 excuse compliance, including if (1) there is only one riparian 18 landowner; (2) other regulations apply, including storm water 19 outlets regulated by DNR, or a conservation program regulated 20 by the federal or state government; (3) the land is covered by 21 another object or structure; (4) the land is used to produce 22 a designated crop; (5) the land is part of an environmentally 23 designated area (e.g., a forest); (6) the land contains unique 24 geological characteristics; or (7) the land is subject to 25 construction. The division may also create other exceptions 26 if it determines that the exception would not interfere with 27 the billâs purposes. 28 ENFORCEMENT. The division is to take enforcement action 29 against a landowner who violates a term or condition of a 30 plan, unless the division allows the commissioners to take an 31 enforcement action in court for the landownerâs violation of 32 the terms of an administrative order (e.g., for violating the 33 terms of a cost-share agreement). If the division enforces the 34 plan, if must first issue a compliance order listing items that 35 -14- LSB 1895YH (4) 91 da/ns 14/ 15 H.F. 151 the landowner must complete within a specified time but not 1 more than one year after the compliance order has been issued. 2 The bill also prohibits a landowner or another person from 3 engaging in any work to remove or degrade a riparian protection 4 measure, unless the person has obtained authorization. The 5 bill provides a range of civil penalties based on the number of 6 parcels included in the plan and the period that the violation 7 continues after the compliance order was delivered. The 8 amounts of the civil penalties range from $100 to $500 per 9 parcel. 10 -15- LSB 1895YH (4) 91 da/ns 15/ 15

This bill amends Code chapter 466B, which provides 20 for a number of programs to protect surface water and provide 21 for flood mitigation and watershed management. The bill 22 creates a new Code subchapter which requires a landowner having 23 an interest in property adjoining a public water source (e.g., 24 a watercourse such as a river, stream, or drainage ditch; or a 25 body of water such as a pond, lake, or reservoir) to establish 26 and maintain a riparian protection measure (measure) in 27 compliance with a riparian protection compliance plan (plan). 28 The plan is derived from a riparian protection inventory and 29 map developed by the department of natural resources (DNR). 30 ADMINISTRATION. The plan must be prepared by the landowner 31 and approved by the division of soil conservation and water 32 quality (division) of the department of agriculture and 33 land stewardship. The division must act in partnership 34 with commissioners of soil and water conservation districts 35 -13- LSB 1895YH (4) 91 da/ns 13/ 15 H.F. 151 (commissioners), and in cooperation with a number of other 1 government entities, including the state soil conservation 2 and water quality committee, the water resources coordinating 3 council, and DNR. 4 REQUIREMENTS. Under an approved plan, a landowner must 5 establish and maintain a measure which is either a riparian 6 protection buffer consisting of perennial vegetation, or an 7 alternative riparian protection practice (e.g., erosion control 8 practice or soil and water conservation practice) alone or in 9 combination with a modified riparian protection buffer. The 10 landowner must establish and maintain the measure after the 11 division completes a riparian protection inventory and map 12 which identifies the land subject to riparian protection. A 13 landowner may apply for financial assistance to establish a 14 measure under a number of programs, including cost-share moneys 15 awarded under the authority of the division. 16 EXCEPTIONS. The bill creates a number of exceptions that 17 excuse compliance, including if (1) there is only one riparian 18 landowner; (2) other regulations apply, including storm water 19 outlets regulated by DNR, or a conservation program regulated 20 by the federal or state government; (3) the land is covered by 21 another object or structure; (4) the land is used to produce 22 a designated crop; (5) the land is part of an environmentally 23 designated area (e.g., a forest); (6) the land contains unique 24 geological characteristics; or (7) the land is subject to 25 construction. The division may also create other exceptions 26 if it determines that the exception would not interfere with 27 the billâs purposes. 28 ENFORCEMENT. The division is to take enforcement action 29 against a landowner who violates a term or condition of a 30 plan, unless the division allows the commissioners to take an 31 enforcement action in court for the landownerâs violation of 32 the terms of an administrative order (e.g., for violating the 33 terms of a cost-share agreement). If the division enforces the 34 plan, if must first issue a compliance order listing items that 35 -14- LSB 1895YH (4) 91 da/ns 14/ 15 H.F. 151 the landowner must complete within a specified time but not 1 more than one year after the compliance order has been issued. 2 The bill also prohibits a landowner or another person from 3 engaging in any work to remove or degrade a riparian protection 4 measure, unless the person has obtained authorization. The 5 bill provides a range of civil penalties based on the number of 6 parcels included in the plan and the period that the violation 7 continues after the compliance order was delivered. The 8 amounts of the civil penalties range from $100 to $500 per 9 parcel. 10 -15- LSB 1895YH (4) 91 da/ns 15/ 15
