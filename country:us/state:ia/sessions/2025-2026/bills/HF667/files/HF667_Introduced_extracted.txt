This chapter applies to arbitration of a family law 1 dispute under an arbitration agreement made on or after the 2 effective date of this Act. 3 2. If an arbitration agreement was made before the effective 4 date of this Act, the parties may agree in a record that this 5 chapter applies to the arbitration. 6 EXPLANATION 7 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 8 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 9 This bill creates the Iowa uniform family law arbitration 10 Act. The bill provides definitions, including the terms 11 âarbitratorâ, âchild custody disputeâ, âchild support disputeâ, 12 and âfamily law disputeâ. 13 The bill governs the arbitration in a family dispute but does 14 not allow an arbitrator to grant a legal separation, a divorce, 15 a dissolution of marriage, or an annulment; to terminate 16 parental rights, to grant an adoption or a guardianship of 17 a child or protected person; or to determine the status of 18 dependency of a child or the support of a child. 19 The bill provides that an arbitration agreement must be in 20 a record signed by the parties. The agreement must identify 21 the arbitrator, an arbitration organization, or a method of 22 selecting an arbitrator and identify the family law dispute 23 the parties intend to arbitrate. The bill provides that a 24 family law dispute that arises after the arbitration agreement 25 is made unenforceable unless the parties affirm the agreement 26 in a record after the dispute arises or the agreement was 27 entered during a family law proceeding and the court approved 28 or incorporated the agreement in an order issued in the 29 proceeding. If there is an objection to the arbitration 30 agreement on the grounds that it is unenforceable or the 31 agreement does not involve a family dispute, the court shall 32 determine whether it is enforceable or includes an appropriate 33 dispute. 34 The bill provides that notice for arbitration shall be made 35 -16- LSB 1354YH (3) 91 cm/jh 16/ 20 H.F. 667 either in a manner agreed upon or by Code section 679A.15 1 (arbitration ââ applications to district court). 2 The bill requires motions for judicial relief to be filed 3 with the court with the appropriate jurisdiction. A party 4 may file a motion to compel arbitration by the court. The 5 bill also allows a party to file a motion for judicial relief 6 to terminate an arbitration. The bill allows upon motion 7 of a party for the court to order consolidation of separate 8 arbitrations involving the same parties and a common issue 9 of law or fact if necessary for resolution of the family law 10 dispute. 11 The bill provides that an arbitrator must be an attorney at 12 law, a former attorney at law on inactive status, or a retired 13 judge and have successfully completed a combined five hours of 14 instruction in an accredited continuing legal education course 15 on domestic violence and child abuse. 16 The bill requires an arbitrator to disclose any information 17 a reasonable person would believe would affect the arbitratorâs 18 impartiality. The arbitrator, the attorneys, and parties are 19 all required to disclose information that would change the 20 impartiality of the arbitrator or the arbitratorâs ability 21 to make a timely award. The bill provides that if a timely 22 disclosure was not made, a party may file a motion to suspend 23 the arbitration no later than 15 days after such failure. The 24 bill provides that failure to disclose can also result in 25 the vacating of an award and other appropriate relief. Upon 26 discharge of an arbitrator, the parties may select a new 27 arbitrator or request that the court select one. 28 The bill allows a party to an arbitration to be represented 29 by counsel, be accompanied by an individual who will not be 30 used as a witness or advocate, and to fully participate in the 31 arbitration. Parties are not allowed to communicate ex parte 32 with the arbitrator. 33 The bill provides that prior to the selection of an 34 arbitrator, the court may enter a temporary order for the 35 -17- LSB 1354YH (3) 91 cm/jh 17/ 20 H.F. 667 family law dispute. After the selection of an arbitrator, the 1 arbitrator may make a temporary award. 2 The bill provides that if a party is subject to a protection 3 order and the arbitrator determines there is a reasonable 4 basis to believe a party is the victim of domestic violence 5 or a partyâs safety or ability to participate effectively in 6 arbitration is otherwise at risk, the arbitrator shall stay the 7 arbitration and refer the parties to court. The arbitration 8 shall not resume until the party at risk affirms the agreement 9 in a record and the court determines that the affirmation is 10 informed and voluntary, the arbitration is not inconsistent 11 with the protection order, and reasonable procedures are 12 in place to protect the party. The bill provides that if 13 an arbitrator reasonably believes that a child subject to 14 the matter is abused or neglected, the arbitration shall be 15 terminated and the abuse or neglect shall be reported to the 16 court or another appropriate authority. 17 The bill requires that the arbitrator conduct the 18 arbitration in a manner considered appropriate for a fair and 19 expeditious disposition. The bill provides the arbitrator the 20 following powers: to select the rules for the arbitration; 21 conduct the prehearing conferences and the hearing; administer 22 oaths to parties and witnesses; allow any party to conduct 23 prehearing discovery by interrogatories, deposition, requests 24 for production of documents, or other means; determine the 25 admissibility of evidence; and subpoena witnesses or documents 26 upon the arbitratorâs own initiative or request of a party; the 27 power to meet with a child, appoint a representative for the 28 child, and impose procedures to protect a party or child from 29 risk of harm; and to sanction bad faith conduct according to 30 state law governing misconduct in family law proceedings. 31 The bill does not require an arbitration hearing to be 32 recorded. 33 The bill provides that an award shall be made in a record, 34 dated and signed by the arbitrator and the parties shall be 35 -18- LSB 1354YH (3) 91 cm/jh 18/ 20 H.F. 667 given notice. An award is not enforceable as a judgment until 1 confirmed by the court. 2 The bill requires the court to confirm an award given by 3 an arbitrator. The court shall confirm an award if all the 4 parties agree in a record to confirmation or the time period to 5 correct an unconfirmed award or vacate an award has expired. 6 The bill provides that if an award relates to a child custody 7 dispute or a child support dispute, the court shall confirm 8 the award if the court finds that the award complies with the 9 bill and Code chapter 598 (dissolution of marriage and domestic 10 relations) or 600B (paternity and obligation for support) and 11 is in the best interests of the child. The bill provides that 12 upon confirmation, the award is enforceable as a judgment 13 and that unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties, the 14 arbitration proceeds are confidential. 15 The bill allows the arbitrator, upon motion of a party 16 not later than 20 days after notice of the award, to make 17 a correction of an award. For an unconfirmed award, the 18 parties may make a motion for correction and a motion to 19 amend or vacate no later than 30 days after the arbitrator 20 has given notice of the award. The bill allows the court to 21 vacate an unconfirmed award if the moving party shows that 22 the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue 23 means; there was an evident partiality by the arbitrator, 24 corruption by the arbitrator, or other misconduct by the 25 arbitrator; the arbitrator, refused to postpone a hearing, 26 consider evidence material to the controversy, or otherwise did 27 not conduct the hearing impartially; the arbitrator exceeded 28 the arbitratorâs powers; no arbitration agreement exists; or 29 the arbitration was conducted without proper notice. In a 30 child custody dispute, the bill provides that the court shall 31 vacate an unconfirmed award if the moving party establishes 32 that award does not comply with the bill, Code chapter 600B 33 (paternity and obligation for support), or is contrary to the 34 best interests of the child; the statement of reasons in the 35 -19- LSB 1354YH (3) 91 cm/jh 19/ 20 H.F. 667 award is inadequate for court review of the award; or a ground 1 for vacating the award under the bill exists. The court is 2 required to determine a motion in a child custody dispute based 3 on the record of the arbitration hearing and facts occurring 4 after the hearing. If there is no record for the hearing, 5 the court shall consider it de novo. The bill requires that 6 a motion to vacate or amend an award must be filed not later 7 than 30 days after an arbitrator gives notice of an award, the 8 arbitrator makes a correction to the award, or a party moves to 9 vacate the award. 10 The bill allows the parties to arbitrate any dispute arising 11 from the meaning or effect of a confirmed award. 12 The bill requires the court to enter a judgment after 13 confirming, vacating, or amending an award. 14 The bill provides that the parties may modify an award 15 either by the dispute resolution specified in the judgment 16 or award or, if the award or judgment does not specify a 17 dispute-resolution method, the parties may agree to arbitrate 18 or proceed under the relevant Code chapter. 19 The bill allows an order granting or denying a motion to 20 compel arbitration; granting or denying a motion to stay 21 arbitration; confirming or denying confirmation of an award; 22 correcting an award; vacating an award without directing a 23 rehearing; and final judgment to be appealed. 24 The bill provides the arbitrator immunity from civil 25 liability for work on the arbitration with certain exceptions 26 detailed in the bill. 27 The bill applies to arbitration of a family law dispute under 28 an arbitration agreement made on or after the billâs effective 29 date. If an arbitration agreement was made before the billâs 30 effective date, parties may agree in a record that the billâs 31 provisions will apply to the arbitration. 32 -20- LSB 1354YH (3) 91 cm/jh 20/ 20

This chapter applies to arbitration of a family law 1 dispute under an arbitration agreement made on or after the 2 effective date of this Act. 3 2. If an arbitration agreement was made before the effective 4 date of this Act, the parties may agree in a record that this 5 chapter applies to the arbitration. 6 EXPLANATION 7 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 8 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 9 This bill creates the Iowa uniform family law arbitration 10 Act. The bill provides definitions, including the terms 11 âarbitratorâ, âchild custody disputeâ, âchild support disputeâ, 12 and âfamily law disputeâ. 13 The bill governs the arbitration in a family dispute but does 14 not allow an arbitrator to grant a legal separation, a divorce, 15 a dissolution of marriage, or an annulment; to terminate 16 parental rights, to grant an adoption or a guardianship of 17 a child or protected person; or to determine the status of 18 dependency of a child or the support of a child. 19 The bill provides that an arbitration agreement must be in 20 a record signed by the parties. The agreement must identify 21 the arbitrator, an arbitration organization, or a method of 22 selecting an arbitrator and identify the family law dispute 23 the parties intend to arbitrate. The bill provides that a 24 family law dispute that arises after the arbitration agreement 25 is made unenforceable unless the parties affirm the agreement 26 in a record after the dispute arises or the agreement was 27 entered during a family law proceeding and the court approved 28 or incorporated the agreement in an order issued in the 29 proceeding. If there is an objection to the arbitration 30 agreement on the grounds that it is unenforceable or the 31 agreement does not involve a family dispute, the court shall 32 determine whether it is enforceable or includes an appropriate 33 dispute. 34 The bill provides that notice for arbitration shall be made 35 -16- LSB 1354YH (3) 91 cm/jh 16/ 20 H.F. 667 either in a manner agreed upon or by Code section 679A.15 1 (arbitration ââ applications to district court). 2 The bill requires motions for judicial relief to be filed 3 with the court with the appropriate jurisdiction. A party 4 may file a motion to compel arbitration by the court. The 5 bill also allows a party to file a motion for judicial relief 6 to terminate an arbitration. The bill allows upon motion 7 of a party for the court to order consolidation of separate 8 arbitrations involving the same parties and a common issue 9 of law or fact if necessary for resolution of the family law 10 dispute. 11 The bill provides that an arbitrator must be an attorney at 12 law, a former attorney at law on inactive status, or a retired 13 judge and have successfully completed a combined five hours of 14 instruction in an accredited continuing legal education course 15 on domestic violence and child abuse. 16 The bill requires an arbitrator to disclose any information 17 a reasonable person would believe would affect the arbitratorâs 18 impartiality. The arbitrator, the attorneys, and parties are 19 all required to disclose information that would change the 20 impartiality of the arbitrator or the arbitratorâs ability 21 to make a timely award. The bill provides that if a timely 22 disclosure was not made, a party may file a motion to suspend 23 the arbitration no later than 15 days after such failure. The 24 bill provides that failure to disclose can also result in 25 the vacating of an award and other appropriate relief. Upon 26 discharge of an arbitrator, the parties may select a new 27 arbitrator or request that the court select one. 28 The bill allows a party to an arbitration to be represented 29 by counsel, be accompanied by an individual who will not be 30 used as a witness or advocate, and to fully participate in the 31 arbitration. Parties are not allowed to communicate ex parte 32 with the arbitrator. 33 The bill provides that prior to the selection of an 34 arbitrator, the court may enter a temporary order for the 35 -17- LSB 1354YH (3) 91 cm/jh 17/ 20 H.F. 667 family law dispute. After the selection of an arbitrator, the 1 arbitrator may make a temporary award. 2 The bill provides that if a party is subject to a protection 3 order and the arbitrator determines there is a reasonable 4 basis to believe a party is the victim of domestic violence 5 or a partyâs safety or ability to participate effectively in 6 arbitration is otherwise at risk, the arbitrator shall stay the 7 arbitration and refer the parties to court. The arbitration 8 shall not resume until the party at risk affirms the agreement 9 in a record and the court determines that the affirmation is 10 informed and voluntary, the arbitration is not inconsistent 11 with the protection order, and reasonable procedures are 12 in place to protect the party. The bill provides that if 13 an arbitrator reasonably believes that a child subject to 14 the matter is abused or neglected, the arbitration shall be 15 terminated and the abuse or neglect shall be reported to the 16 court or another appropriate authority. 17 The bill requires that the arbitrator conduct the 18 arbitration in a manner considered appropriate for a fair and 19 expeditious disposition. The bill provides the arbitrator the 20 following powers: to select the rules for the arbitration; 21 conduct the prehearing conferences and the hearing; administer 22 oaths to parties and witnesses; allow any party to conduct 23 prehearing discovery by interrogatories, deposition, requests 24 for production of documents, or other means; determine the 25 admissibility of evidence; and subpoena witnesses or documents 26 upon the arbitratorâs own initiative or request of a party; the 27 power to meet with a child, appoint a representative for the 28 child, and impose procedures to protect a party or child from 29 risk of harm; and to sanction bad faith conduct according to 30 state law governing misconduct in family law proceedings. 31 The bill does not require an arbitration hearing to be 32 recorded. 33 The bill provides that an award shall be made in a record, 34 dated and signed by the arbitrator and the parties shall be 35 -18- LSB 1354YH (3) 91 cm/jh 18/ 20 H.F. 667 given notice. An award is not enforceable as a judgment until 1 confirmed by the court. 2 The bill requires the court to confirm an award given by 3 an arbitrator. The court shall confirm an award if all the 4 parties agree in a record to confirmation or the time period to 5 correct an unconfirmed award or vacate an award has expired. 6 The bill provides that if an award relates to a child custody 7 dispute or a child support dispute, the court shall confirm 8 the award if the court finds that the award complies with the 9 bill and Code chapter 598 (dissolution of marriage and domestic 10 relations) or 600B (paternity and obligation for support) and 11 is in the best interests of the child. The bill provides that 12 upon confirmation, the award is enforceable as a judgment 13 and that unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties, the 14 arbitration proceeds are confidential. 15 The bill allows the arbitrator, upon motion of a party 16 not later than 20 days after notice of the award, to make 17 a correction of an award. For an unconfirmed award, the 18 parties may make a motion for correction and a motion to 19 amend or vacate no later than 30 days after the arbitrator 20 has given notice of the award. The bill allows the court to 21 vacate an unconfirmed award if the moving party shows that 22 the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue 23 means; there was an evident partiality by the arbitrator, 24 corruption by the arbitrator, or other misconduct by the 25 arbitrator; the arbitrator, refused to postpone a hearing, 26 consider evidence material to the controversy, or otherwise did 27 not conduct the hearing impartially; the arbitrator exceeded 28 the arbitratorâs powers; no arbitration agreement exists; or 29 the arbitration was conducted without proper notice. In a 30 child custody dispute, the bill provides that the court shall 31 vacate an unconfirmed award if the moving party establishes 32 that award does not comply with the bill, Code chapter 600B 33 (paternity and obligation for support), or is contrary to the 34 best interests of the child; the statement of reasons in the 35 -19- LSB 1354YH (3) 91 cm/jh 19/ 20 H.F. 667 award is inadequate for court review of the award; or a ground 1 for vacating the award under the bill exists. The court is 2 required to determine a motion in a child custody dispute based 3 on the record of the arbitration hearing and facts occurring 4 after the hearing. If there is no record for the hearing, 5 the court shall consider it de novo. The bill requires that 6 a motion to vacate or amend an award must be filed not later 7 than 30 days after an arbitrator gives notice of an award, the 8 arbitrator makes a correction to the award, or a party moves to 9 vacate the award. 10 The bill allows the parties to arbitrate any dispute arising 11 from the meaning or effect of a confirmed award. 12 The bill requires the court to enter a judgment after 13 confirming, vacating, or amending an award. 14 The bill provides that the parties may modify an award 15 either by the dispute resolution specified in the judgment 16 or award or, if the award or judgment does not specify a 17 dispute-resolution method, the parties may agree to arbitrate 18 or proceed under the relevant Code chapter. 19 The bill allows an order granting or denying a motion to 20 compel arbitration; granting or denying a motion to stay 21 arbitration; confirming or denying confirmation of an award; 22 correcting an award; vacating an award without directing a 23 rehearing; and final judgment to be appealed. 24 The bill provides the arbitrator immunity from civil 25 liability for work on the arbitration with certain exceptions 26 detailed in the bill. 27 The bill applies to arbitration of a family law dispute under 28 an arbitration agreement made on or after the billâs effective 29 date. If an arbitration agreement was made before the billâs 30 effective date, parties may agree in a record that the billâs 31 provisions will apply to the arbitration. 32 -20- LSB 1354YH (3) 91 cm/jh 20/ 20
