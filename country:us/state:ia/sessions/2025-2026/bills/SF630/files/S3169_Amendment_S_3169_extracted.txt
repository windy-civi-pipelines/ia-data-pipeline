S-3169
1 Amend Senate File 630 as follows:
2 1. By striking everything after the enacting clause and
3 inserting:
4 <Section 1. Section 2.42, Code 2025, is amended by adding
5 the following new subsection:
6 NEW SUBSECTION. 17. To review and disapprove
7 interdepartmental transfers described in section 8.39,
8 subsection 4, paragraph “c”, as the council may determine.
9 Sec. 2. Section 8.39, subsections 2 and 4, Code 2025, are
10 amended to read as follows:
11 2. If the appropriation of a department, institution,
12 or agency is insufficient to properly meet the legitimate
13 expenses of the department, institution, or agency, the
14 director of the department of management, with the approval
15 of the governor, may make an interdepartmental transfer from
16 any other department, institution, or agency of the state
17 having an appropriation in excess of its needs, of sufficient
18 funds moneys to meet that deficiency. Such transfer shall
19 be to an appropriation made from the same funding source and
20 within the same fiscal year. The amount of a transfer made
21 from an appropriation under this subsection shall be limited
22 to not more than one-tenth of one percent of the total of all
23 appropriations made from the funding source of the transferred
24 appropriation for the fiscal year in which the transfer is
25 made. An interdepartmental transfer to an appropriation which
26 is not an entitlement appropriation is not authorized when
27 the general assembly is in regular session and, in addition,
28 the sum of interdepartmental transfers in a fiscal year to an
29 appropriation which is not an entitlement appropriation shall

1 the appropriation to be more than the amount necessary to carry
2 out that purpose. An appropriation for an unspecified dollar
3 amount, whether the appropriation is limited to be sufficient
4 to carry out a particular purpose or is unlimited, shall not
5 be considered an appropriation in excess of a department’s,
6 institution’s, or agency’s needs.
7 b. “Entitlement appropriation” means a line item
8 appropriation to the state public defender for indigent defense
9 or to the department of health and human services for foster
10 care, state supplementary assistance, medical assistance, or
11 for the family investment program.
12 4. a. Prior to any transfer of funds moneys pursuant
13 to subsection 1 or 2 of this section, or a transfer of an
14 allocation from a subunit of a department which statutorily has
15 independent budgeting authority, the director of the department
16 of management shall notify the chairpersons of the standing
17 committees on appropriations of the senate and the house of
18 representatives and the chairpersons of subcommittees of such
19 committees of the proposed transfer. The notice from the
20 director shall include information concerning the amount of the
21 proposed transfer, the departments, institutions, or agencies
22 affected by the proposed transfer, and the reasons for the
23 proposed transfer. Chairpersons
24 b. Unless a transfer is governed under paragraph “c”,
25 chairpersons notified shall be given at least two weeks to
26 review and comment on the proposed transfer before the transfer
27 of funds is made.
28 c. (1) This paragraph applies to any transfer made for a
29 fiscal year under subsection 2 between July 1 of that fiscal
30 year and the subsequent first day of the regular session of the
31 general assembly occurring in that fiscal year.
32 (2) The director shall submit the notice required by this
33 subsection to the chairpersons at least three weeks before the
34 proposed transfer is made.
35 (3) In addition to the information otherwise required, the

1 notice required by this subsection and submitted under this
2 paragraph must also include all of the following:
3 (a) Information demonstrating that the appropriation from
4 which the transfer will be made is in excess of the entity’s
5 needs taking into account the date on which the transfer will
6 occur within the fiscal year, and the reason the excess was not
7 anticipated.
8 (b) Information demonstrating that the appropriation to
9 which the transfer will be made is insufficient to properly
10 meet the legitimate expenses of the entity taking into account
11 the date on which the transfer will occur within the fiscal
12 year, and the reason the deficiency was not anticipated.
13 (c) Information demonstrating that sufficient state moneys
14 are available in the single funding source involved in the
15 transfer, and citations to the law under which all entities
16 affected by the transfer were appropriated moneys from that
17 funding source for the applicable fiscal year.
18 (4) Prior to the date the proposed transfer will be made,
19 the legislative council may meet to consider the transfer. At
20 the meeting, the legislative council may vote to disapprove the
21 transfer. If the legislative council disapproves the transfer,
22 the transfer shall not occur.
23 Sec. 3. Section 8.57C, subsections 2, 3, and 4, Code 2025,
24 are amended to read as follows:
25 2. Moneys in the fund in a fiscal year shall be used as
26 appropriated by the general assembly for the acquisition

1 but not limited to new information technology projects
2 and infrastructure replacement efforts of a department or
3 establishment.
4 a. The department shall prioritize proposed projects based
5 on all of the following considerations:
6 (1) Whether the project aligns with the state’s strategic
7 priorities.
8 (2) Whether the project promotes or introduces new
9 technology or significantly improves an existing system.
10 (3) Whether the project is feasible and whether the
11 department or establishment has established readiness for the
12 project to proceed, including a clear assessment of timelines,
13 budgets, and measurable outcomes.
14 (4) Whether the project includes a clear change management
15 strategy to support user adoption and aligns with lean
16 enterprise principles to maximize value, minimize waste, and
17 ensure continuous improvement.
18 (5) Whether the project provides a positive return on
19 investment, considering both financial returns and nonfinancial
20 benefits such as improved public safety, education, or health
21 care.
22 (6) Whether the project results in infrastructure that is
23 scalable across the state enterprise.
24 (7) Whether the department or establishment has identified
25 how the completed project will be sustained beyond the initial
26 funding period.
27 (8) Whether the project improves access to governmental
28 services, particularly in rural communities.
29 (9) Whether the project involves an infrastructure project
30 as opposed to maintenance or standard upgrades of existing
31 technology.
32 b. The department shall provide a prioritized list of
33 proposed projects for funding to the governor, who shall use
34 the list in developing a budgetary recommendation for the
35 general assembly pursuant to section 8.21.
