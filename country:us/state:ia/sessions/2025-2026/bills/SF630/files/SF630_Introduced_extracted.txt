The section of this Act enacting section 8.96. 24 Sec. 24. RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY. The following applies 25 retroactively to January 1, 2020: 26 The section of this Act amending section 513C.10, subsection 27 1, paragraph âaâ. 28 EXPLANATION 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 30 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 31 This bill relates to state government. 32 The bill strikes current law providing for the use of moneys 33 in the technology reinvestment fund for certain technology 34 projects and instead requires the department of management 35 -13- LSB 1362SZ (2) 91 sc/ns 13/ 15 S.F. 630 (DOM) to use moneys in the fund for technology projects 1 using factors set forth in the bill. The bill requires 2 DOM to provide a prioritized list of proposed projects to 3 the governor, who must use the list to develop a budgetary 4 recommendation to the general assembly, and to report completed 5 and ongoing projects to the general assembly annually. The 6 bill strikes the standing appropriation to the technology 7 reinvestment fund and provides that any moneys in the fund 8 shall remain available for three years after the appropriation 9 is made. 10 The bill increases the frequency at which a person 11 performing work for DOM or an individual on the information 12 technology staff of a supported entity may be subject to a 13 national criminal history check through the federal bureau of 14 investigation from at least once every 10 years to every 5 15 years. 16 The bill prohibits the inclusion of certain provisions in 17 information technology contracts and declares those provisions 18 void if present in such contracts. The bill also provides that 19 such contracts are deemed to include provisions requiring the 20 contract to be governed by Iowa law and litigation related to 21 the contract to be brought and maintained in a state or federal 22 court sitting in Iowa. The bill authorizes the director of 23 DOM to include limitations of vendor liability in information 24 technology goods and services contracts, but sets forth 25 prohibited terms in such limitations of liability. 26 The bill makes all communication concerning cybersecurity 27 between the chief information security officer and other 28 entities confidential and allows the communications to be 29 released only for specific purposes. 30 Under current law, the department of health and human 31 services serves as the Iowa statistical analysis center and 32 maintains an integrated information system for data sharing 33 among federal, state, and local governments. The bill 34 transfers these powers and duties to DOM and grants DOM access 35 -14- LSB 1362SZ (2) 91 sc/ns 14/ 15 S.F. 630 to criminal justice information other than intelligence data 1 and peace officer investigative reports maintained by the 2 department of public safety. DOM is authorized to provide 3 data analysis and reporting on issues that may affect the 4 stateâs correctional population and various subgroups of the 5 population, to maintain a multiagency information system to 6 track the progress of juveniles and adults charged with a 7 criminal offense through state and local agencies and programs, 8 and to count and track decision points for individuals in 9 the juvenile justice system, child welfare system, and 10 court system. If DOM lacks sufficient moneys to perform the 11 authorized tasks of the Iowa statistical analysis center, the 12 bill allows DOM to determine which, if any, to implement. 13 The bill states that DOM is not the lawful custodian under 14 Code chapter 22 (open records) for records DOM maintains in 15 DOMâs information technology capacity for other state entities 16 as an automated data processing unit of government or when 17 held by DOM solely for storage for another department or 18 establishment. The bill requires DOM to deny requests for 19 information for which DOM is not the lawful custodian, to 20 provide assistance to the lawful custodian to comply with 21 production obligations, and to cooperate in any efforts to 22 resist associated subpoenas. 23 The bill excludes the state from membership in the Iowa 24 individual health benefit reinsurance association. This 25 provision takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively 26 to January 1, 2020. 27 -15- LSB 1362SZ (2) 91 sc/ns 15/ 15

EFFECTIVE DATE. The following take effect July 1, 16 2026: 17 The portions of the section of this Act amending section 18 8.57C, subsections 2 and 4. 19 Sec. 23. APPLICABILITY. The following apply to contracts 20 entered into or renewed on or after July 1, 2025: 21 1. The section of this Act enacting section 8.94. 22 2. The section of this Act enacting section 8.95. 23 3. The section of this Act enacting section 8.96. 24 Sec. 24. RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY. The following applies 25 retroactively to January 1, 2020: 26 The section of this Act amending section 513C.10, subsection 27 1, paragraph âaâ. 28 EXPLANATION 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 30 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 31 This bill relates to state government. 32 The bill strikes current law providing for the use of moneys 33 in the technology reinvestment fund for certain technology 34 projects and instead requires the department of management 35 -13- LSB 1362SZ (2) 91 sc/ns 13/ 15 S.F. 630 (DOM) to use moneys in the fund for technology projects 1 using factors set forth in the bill. The bill requires 2 DOM to provide a prioritized list of proposed projects to 3 the governor, who must use the list to develop a budgetary 4 recommendation to the general assembly, and to report completed 5 and ongoing projects to the general assembly annually. The 6 bill strikes the standing appropriation to the technology 7 reinvestment fund and provides that any moneys in the fund 8 shall remain available for three years after the appropriation 9 is made. 10 The bill increases the frequency at which a person 11 performing work for DOM or an individual on the information 12 technology staff of a supported entity may be subject to a 13 national criminal history check through the federal bureau of 14 investigation from at least once every 10 years to every 5 15 years. 16 The bill prohibits the inclusion of certain provisions in 17 information technology contracts and declares those provisions 18 void if present in such contracts. The bill also provides that 19 such contracts are deemed to include provisions requiring the 20 contract to be governed by Iowa law and litigation related to 21 the contract to be brought and maintained in a state or federal 22 court sitting in Iowa. The bill authorizes the director of 23 DOM to include limitations of vendor liability in information 24 technology goods and services contracts, but sets forth 25 prohibited terms in such limitations of liability. 26 The bill makes all communication concerning cybersecurity 27 between the chief information security officer and other 28 entities confidential and allows the communications to be 29 released only for specific purposes. 30 Under current law, the department of health and human 31 services serves as the Iowa statistical analysis center and 32 maintains an integrated information system for data sharing 33 among federal, state, and local governments. The bill 34 transfers these powers and duties to DOM and grants DOM access 35 -14- LSB 1362SZ (2) 91 sc/ns 14/ 15 S.F. 630 to criminal justice information other than intelligence data 1 and peace officer investigative reports maintained by the 2 department of public safety. DOM is authorized to provide 3 data analysis and reporting on issues that may affect the 4 stateâs correctional population and various subgroups of the 5 population, to maintain a multiagency information system to 6 track the progress of juveniles and adults charged with a 7 criminal offense through state and local agencies and programs, 8 and to count and track decision points for individuals in 9 the juvenile justice system, child welfare system, and 10 court system. If DOM lacks sufficient moneys to perform the 11 authorized tasks of the Iowa statistical analysis center, the 12 bill allows DOM to determine which, if any, to implement. 13 The bill states that DOM is not the lawful custodian under 14 Code chapter 22 (open records) for records DOM maintains in 15 DOMâs information technology capacity for other state entities 16 as an automated data processing unit of government or when 17 held by DOM solely for storage for another department or 18 establishment. The bill requires DOM to deny requests for 19 information for which DOM is not the lawful custodian, to 20 provide assistance to the lawful custodian to comply with 21 production obligations, and to cooperate in any efforts to 22 resist associated subpoenas. 23 The bill excludes the state from membership in the Iowa 24 individual health benefit reinsurance association. This 25 provision takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively 26 to January 1, 2020. 27 -15- LSB 1362SZ (2) 91 sc/ns 15/ 15
