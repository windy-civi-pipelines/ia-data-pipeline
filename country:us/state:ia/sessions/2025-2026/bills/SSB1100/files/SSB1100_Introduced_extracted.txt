Section 257.10, subsection 9, paragraph a, 3 subparagraph (3), subparagraph divisions (b) and (c), Code 4 2025, are amended to read as follows: 5 (b) The department of management shall categorize all 6 school districts into not more than ten tiers according to each 7 school districtâs actual enrollment. Each tier established 8 by the department of management containing a school district 9 with an actual enrollment above three thousand five hundred 10 pupils shall contain, to the extent feasible, the same number 11 of school districts as other tiers containing school districts 12 with an actual enrollment of more than three thousand five 13 hundred pupils. Each tier established by the department 14 of management containing a school district with an actual 15 enrollment equal to or less than three thousand five hundred 16 pupils shall contain, to the extent feasible, the same number 17 of school districts as other tiers containing school districts 18 with an actual enrollment equal to or less than three thousand 19 five hundred pupils. 20 (c) (b) (i) To support school districts with meeting 21 the minimum teacher salary requirements under chapter 284, 22 including the minimum teacher starting salary requirement 23 of fifty thousand dollars ; and the minimum teacher salary 24 requirement for full-time teachers with, as of July 1, 2025, at 25 least twelve years of experience of sixty-two thousand dollars 26 under chapter 284 ; and the minimum teacher salary requirement 27 for teachers with at least twelve years of experience, who 28 have had a bona fide retirement from employment with a covered 29 employer as provided in section 97B.52A, and who have returned 30 to covered employment with a covered employer pursuant to 31 chapter 97B as a teacher licensed under chapter 256, of 32 fifty thousand dollars, and other costs associated with such 33 salary requirements, as identified in subparagraph subdivision 34 (ii) including costs associated with the employerâs share of 35 -1- LSB 1126XL (12) 91 jda/jh 1/ 13 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ contributions to the Iowa public employeesâ retirement system 1 and the employerâs share of the tax imposed by the federal 2 Insurance Contributions Act , the department of management 3 shall calculate and assign to all school districts in a tier 4 established under subparagraph division (b), a teacher salary 5 supplement district cost per pupil in an amount based in part 6 on the average cost to school districts within the tier to meet 7 the requirements , plus an amount equal to the teacher salary 8 supplement supplemental state aid amount for the budget year . 9 (ii) If, however, a school districtâs total teacher 10 salary supplement district cost under paragraph âcâ , as 11 calculated using the teacher salary supplement district cost 12 per pupil assigned to the school districtâs applicable tier, 13 is insufficient to comply with the applicable minimum teacher 14 salary requirements of the school district, including costs 15 associated with the employerâs share of contributions to the 16 Iowa public employeesâ retirement system and the employerâs 17 share of the tax imposed by the federal Insurance Contributions 18 Act , the department of management shall set the school 19 districtâs teacher salary supplement district cost per pupil 20 at an amount necessary to meet the districtâs minimum salary 21 requirements and associated costs. If, however, a school 22 district reported a teacherâs years of experience incorrectly 23 on the fall 2023 basic educational data survey compared to the 24 fall 2024 basic educational data survey, and the difference 25 would have resulted in an additional per pupil amount for 26 the budget year beginning July 1, 2024, the department of 27 management shall increase the teacher salary supplement 28 district cost per pupil for the budget year beginning July 1, 29 2025, by the difference between the teacher salary supplement 30 district cost per pupil that would have been calculated if not 31 for the incorrect reporting and the teacher salary supplement 32 district cost per pupil actually calculated. 33 Sec. 2.

(1) For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025, and each 32 subsequent fiscal year, the minimum salary of fifty thousand 33 dollars for a full-time teacher who has less than twelve years 34 of teaching experience and a minimum salary of sixty-two 35 -8- LSB 1126XL (12) 91 jda/jh 8/ 13 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ thousand dollars for a full-time teacher who has at least 1 twelve years of teaching experience. 2 (2) Notwithstanding subparagraph (1), for the fiscal year 3 beginning July 1, 2025, and each subsequent fiscal year, a 4 minimum salary of fifty thousand dollars for a full-time 5 teacher who has at least twelve years of teaching experience, 6 who has had a bona fide retirement from employment with a 7 covered employer as provided in section 97B.52A, and who has 8 returned to covered employment with a covered employer pursuant 9 to chapter 97B as a teacher licensed under chapter 256. 10 EXPLANATION 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 12 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 13 This bill relates to education, including by modifying 14 provisions related to the calculation of the teacher salary 15 supplement district cost per pupil, teacher preparation 16 requirements, out-of-state placement of certain specified 17 students requiring special education, the duties of the 18 department of education (DE), and minimum teacher salaries. 19 DIVISION I ââ TEACHER SALARY SUPPLEMENT DISTRICT COST PER 20 PUPIL. Current law requires the department of management 21 (DOM), beginning July 1, 2025, to categorize all school 22 districts into not more than 10 tiers according to each school 23 districtâs actual enrollment and to calculate and assign 24 to all school districts within each tier a teacher salary 25 supplement district cost per pupil in an amount based on the 26 average cost to school districts within the tier to meet 27 requirements related to minimum teacher salaries. The bill 28 strikes the provisions related to tiers and instead requires 29 DOM to calculate and assign to all school districts a teacher 30 salary supplement district cost per pupil in an amount to meet 31 the requirements related to minimum teacher salaries, including 32 costs associated with the employerâs share of contributions to 33 the Iowa public employeesâ retirement system (IPERS) and the 34 employerâs share of the tax imposed by the federal Insurance 35 -9- LSB 1126XL (12) 91 jda/jh 9/ 13 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ Contributions Act, plus an amount equal to the teacher salary 1 supplement supplemental state aid amount for the budget year. 2 The bill provides that if a school district reported a 3 teacherâs years of experience incorrectly on the fall 2023 4 basic educational data survey compared to the fall 2024 basic 5 educational data survey, and the difference would have resulted 6 in an additional per pupil amount for the budget year beginning 7 July 1, 2024, DOM shall increase the teacher salary supplement 8 district cost per pupil for the budget year beginning July 1, 9 2025, by the difference between the teacher salary supplement 10 district cost per pupil that would have been calculated if not 11 for the incorrect reporting and the teacher salary supplement 12 district cost per pupil actually calculated. 13 The division takes effect upon enactment. 14 DIVISION II ââ TEACHER PREPARATION. Current law provides 15 that pre-student teaching field experiences for students 16 participating in a teacher intern preparation program shall 17 comprise at least 50 hours in duration. The bill modifies this 18 provision to provide that such field may comprise at least 50 19 hours in duration. 20 Current law provides that a student shall be credited 21 a minimum of 1 week, but not more than 10 weeks, of prior 22 work experience as a substitute teacher or a para-educator 23 toward the requirements associated with the 14-week student 24 teaching experience, if, among other requirements, the board of 25 educational examiners (BOEE) has issued a substitute license, 26 substitute authorization, or a para-educator certificate to 27 the student. The bill modifies this requirement to provide 28 that, if the student has prior work experience as a substitute 29 teacher, the BOEE has issued a substitute license or a 30 substitute authorization to the student. 31 The bill strikes the requirement that the BOEE must have 32 issued a para-educator certificate to the student in order for 33 the student to be credited a minimum of 1 week, but not more 34 than 14 weeks, of work experience as a para-educator toward 35 -10- LSB 1126XL (12) 91 jda/jh 10/ 13 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ the requirements associated with the 14-week student teaching 1 experience. 2 The bill strikes the requirement that a participant in a 3 program provided by a higher education institution that is 4 designed to assist students in attaining a teacher intern 5 license from the BOEE must submit with the application to the 6 program a copy of an offer of employment from a school. 7 DIVISION III ââ OUT-OF-STATE PLACEMENT. The bill provides 8 that a childâs district of residence may place the child in 9 an out-of-state facility or with an out-of-state provider for 10 purposes of providing the child with the education required 11 under Code chapter 256B (special education), subject to 12 the terms of an agreement between the childâs district of 13 residence and the facility or provider. The bill establishes 14 requirements related to the agreement. 15 The bill provides that a childâs district of residence 16 is not financially responsible for the services provided 17 by an out-of-state facility or an out-of-state provider to 18 a child unless the out-of-state facility or out-of-state 19 provider provides notice to the childâs district of residence 20 that the child may be subject to the billâs provisions and 21 the childâs district of residence enters into an agreement 22 with the out-of-state facility or out-of-state provider that 23 satisfies the billâs requirements related to such agreements. 24 Additionally, the bill provides that, by August 1 following the 25 school year in which the out-of-state facility or out-of-state 26 provider provided services to a child pursuant to an agreement, 27 the childâs district of residence may submit an accounting 28 to DE that describes the cost of the services provided by 29 the facility or provider during such school year. The bill 30 requires that by August 15 following the school year in which 31 the out-of-state facility or out-of-state provider provided 32 services to a child pursuant to an agreement, DE shall review 33 and either approve or modify the accounting and make payment 34 to the childâs district of residence toward the school year in 35 -11- LSB 1126XL (12) 91 jda/jh 11/ 13 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ which the cost of the services was incurred. The bill provides 1 that any amounts paid by DE to school districts in this state 2 pursuant to these provisions shall be deducted on a monthly 3 basis from the state foundation aid paid under Code section 4 257.16 to all school districts in the state in the school year 5 following the school year in which the services were provided. 6 The portion of the total amount paid by DE to a district that 7 is required to be deducted from the state foundation aid paid 8 to the district is the same as the ratio that the budget 9 enrollment for the budget year of the district bears to the 10 total budget enrollment in the state for that budget year. 11 The bill defines âchildâ, âdistrict of residenceâ, and 12 âresidentâ. 13 DIVISION IV ââ ONLINE STATE JOB POSTING SYSTEM. Current 14 Code section 84A.6(4) requires the department of workforce 15 development (IWD), in consultation with DE, to establish a 16 system that allows DE, school districts, charter schools, 17 area education agencies, and accredited nonpublic schools to 18 post job openings on an internet site. Current Code section 19 84A.6(4) also requires DE, school districts, charter schools, 20 and area education agencies to submit all job openings to 21 IWD for posting on the internet site. Current Code section 22 84A.6(4) establishes requirements related to the job openings 23 system. The bill strikes Code section 84A.6(4) and enacts new 24 Code section 256.27, which transfers to DE the responsibilities 25 related to establishing and operating an online state job 26 posting system for school districts, charter schools, area 27 education agencies, and accredited nonpublic schools. 28 DIVISION V ââ TEACHER COMPENSATION. Current Code chapter 29 284 (teacher compensation) provides that the minimum annual 30 salary for a teacher who has at least 12 years of teaching 31 experience shall be at least $62,000. The bill provides 32 that if such a teacher has had a bona fide retirement from 33 employment with a covered employer as provided in Code section 34 97B.52A (bona fide retirement under IPERS), and has returned 35 -12- LSB 1126XL (12) 91 jda/jh 12/ 13 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ to covered employment with a covered employer as a licensed 1 teacher, the teacherâs minimum annual salary shall be $50,000. 2 -13- LSB 1126XL (12) 91 jda/jh 13/ 13

Each tier established 8 by the department of management containing a school district 9 with an actual enrollment above three thousand five hundred 10 pupils shall contain, to the extent feasible, the same number 11 of school districts as other tiers containing school districts 12 with an actual enrollment of more than three thousand five 13 hundred pupils. Each tier established by the department 14 of management containing a school district with an actual 15 enrollment equal to or less than three thousand five hundred 16 pupils shall contain, to the extent feasible, the same number 17 of school districts as other tiers containing school districts 18 with an actual enrollment equal to or less than three thousand 19 five hundred pupils. 20 (c) (b) (i) To support school districts with meeting 21 the minimum teacher salary requirements under chapter 284, 22 including the minimum teacher starting salary requirement 23 of fifty thousand dollars ; and the minimum teacher salary 24 requirement for full-time teachers with, as of July 1, 2025, at 25 least twelve years of experience of sixty-two thousand dollars 26 under chapter 284 ; and the minimum teacher salary requirement 27 for teachers with at least twelve years of experience, who 28 have had a bona fide retirement from employment with a covered 29 employer as provided in section 97B.52A, and who have returned 30 to covered employment with a covered employer pursuant to 31 chapter 97B as a teacher licensed under chapter 256, of 32 fifty thousand dollars, and other costs associated with such 33 salary requirements, as identified in subparagraph subdivision 34 (ii) including costs associated with the employerâs share of 35 -1- LSB 1126XL (12) 91 jda/jh 1/ 13 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ contributions to the Iowa public employeesâ retirement system 1 and the employerâs share of the tax imposed by the federal 2 Insurance Contributions Act , the department of management 3 shall calculate and assign to all school districts in a tier 4 established under subparagraph division (b), a teacher salary 5 supplement district cost per pupil in an amount based in part 6 on the average cost to school districts within the tier to meet 7 the requirements , plus an amount equal to the teacher salary 8 supplement supplemental state aid amount for the budget year . 9 (ii) If, however, a school districtâs total teacher 10 salary supplement district cost under paragraph âcâ , as 11 calculated using the teacher salary supplement district cost 12 per pupil assigned to the school districtâs applicable tier, 13 is insufficient to comply with the applicable minimum teacher 14 salary requirements of the school district, including costs 15 associated with the employerâs share of contributions to the 16 Iowa public employeesâ retirement system and the employerâs 17 share of the tax imposed by the federal Insurance Contributions 18 Act , the department of management shall set the school 19 districtâs teacher salary supplement district cost per pupil 20 at an amount necessary to meet the districtâs minimum salary 21 requirements and associated costs.

Section 284.16, subsection 2, paragraph b, Code 13 2025, is amended to read as follows: 14 b. (1) For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025, and 15 each subsequent fiscal year, a career teacher, instructional 16 coach, curriculum and professional development leader, or model 17 teacher, who has been a teacher for at least twelve years, 18 shall be paid not less than sixty-two thousand dollars. 19 (2) Notwithstanding subparagraph (1), for the fiscal 20 year beginning July 1, 2025, and each subsequent fiscal 21 year, a career teacher, instructional coach, curriculum and 22 professional development leader, or model teacher, who has been 23 a teacher for at least twelve years, who has had a bona fide 24 retirement from employment with a covered employer as provided 25 in section 97B.52A, and who has returned to covered employment 26 with a covered employer pursuant to chapter 97B as a teacher 27 licensed under chapter 256, shall be paid not less than fifty 28 thousand dollars. 29 Sec. 12. Section 284.17, subsection 1, paragraph b, Code 30 2025, is amended to read as follows: 31 b. (1) For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025, and each 32 subsequent fiscal year, the minimum salary of fifty thousand 33 dollars for a full-time teacher who has less than twelve years 34 of teaching experience and a minimum salary of sixty-two 35 -8- LSB 1126XL (12) 91 jda/jh 8/ 13 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ thousand dollars for a full-time teacher who has at least 1 twelve years of teaching experience. 2 (2) Notwithstanding subparagraph (1), for the fiscal year 3 beginning July 1, 2025, and each subsequent fiscal year, a 4 minimum salary of fifty thousand dollars for a full-time 5 teacher who has at least twelve years of teaching experience, 6 who has had a bona fide retirement from employment with a 7 covered employer as provided in section 97B.52A, and who has 8 returned to covered employment with a covered employer pursuant 9 to chapter 97B as a teacher licensed under chapter 256. 10 EXPLANATION 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 12 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 13 This bill relates to education, including by modifying 14 provisions related to the calculation of the teacher salary 15 supplement district cost per pupil, teacher preparation 16 requirements, out-of-state placement of certain specified 17 students requiring special education, the duties of the 18 department of education (DE), and minimum teacher salaries. 19 DIVISION I ââ TEACHER SALARY SUPPLEMENT DISTRICT COST PER 20 PUPIL. Current law requires the department of management 21 (DOM), beginning July 1, 2025, to categorize all school 22 districts into not more than 10 tiers according to each school 23 districtâs actual enrollment and to calculate and assign 24 to all school districts within each tier a teacher salary 25 supplement district cost per pupil in an amount based on the 26 average cost to school districts within the tier to meet 27 requirements related to minimum teacher salaries. The bill 28 strikes the provisions related to tiers and instead requires 29 DOM to calculate and assign to all school districts a teacher 30 salary supplement district cost per pupil in an amount to meet 31 the requirements related to minimum teacher salaries, including 32 costs associated with the employerâs share of contributions to 33 the Iowa public employeesâ retirement system (IPERS) and the 34 employerâs share of the tax imposed by the federal Insurance 35 -9- LSB 1126XL (12) 91 jda/jh 9/ 13 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ Contributions Act, plus an amount equal to the teacher salary 1 supplement supplemental state aid amount for the budget year. 2 The bill provides that if a school district reported a 3 teacherâs years of experience incorrectly on the fall 2023 4 basic educational data survey compared to the fall 2024 basic 5 educational data survey, and the difference would have resulted 6 in an additional per pupil amount for the budget year beginning 7 July 1, 2024, DOM shall increase the teacher salary supplement 8 district cost per pupil for the budget year beginning July 1, 9 2025, by the difference between the teacher salary supplement 10 district cost per pupil that would have been calculated if not 11 for the incorrect reporting and the teacher salary supplement 12 district cost per pupil actually calculated. 13 The division takes effect upon enactment. 14 DIVISION II ââ TEACHER PREPARATION. Current law provides 15 that pre-student teaching field experiences for students 16 participating in a teacher intern preparation program shall 17 comprise at least 50 hours in duration. The bill modifies this 18 provision to provide that such field may comprise at least 50 19 hours in duration. 20 Current law provides that a student shall be credited 21 a minimum of 1 week, but not more than 10 weeks, of prior 22 work experience as a substitute teacher or a para-educator 23 toward the requirements associated with the 14-week student 24 teaching experience, if, among other requirements, the board of 25 educational examiners (BOEE) has issued a substitute license, 26 substitute authorization, or a para-educator certificate to 27 the student. The bill modifies this requirement to provide 28 that, if the student has prior work experience as a substitute 29 teacher, the BOEE has issued a substitute license or a 30 substitute authorization to the student. 31 The bill strikes the requirement that the BOEE must have 32 issued a para-educator certificate to the student in order for 33 the student to be credited a minimum of 1 week, but not more 34 than 14 weeks, of work experience as a para-educator toward 35 -10- LSB 1126XL (12) 91 jda/jh 10/ 13 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ the requirements associated with the 14-week student teaching 1 experience. 2 The bill strikes the requirement that a participant in a 3 program provided by a higher education institution that is 4 designed to assist students in attaining a teacher intern 5 license from the BOEE must submit with the application to the 6 program a copy of an offer of employment from a school. 7 DIVISION III ââ OUT-OF-STATE PLACEMENT. The bill provides 8 that a childâs district of residence may place the child in 9 an out-of-state facility or with an out-of-state provider for 10 purposes of providing the child with the education required 11 under Code chapter 256B (special education), subject to 12 the terms of an agreement between the childâs district of 13 residence and the facility or provider. The bill establishes 14 requirements related to the agreement. 15 The bill provides that a childâs district of residence 16 is not financially responsible for the services provided 17 by an out-of-state facility or an out-of-state provider to 18 a child unless the out-of-state facility or out-of-state 19 provider provides notice to the childâs district of residence 20 that the child may be subject to the billâs provisions and 21 the childâs district of residence enters into an agreement 22 with the out-of-state facility or out-of-state provider that 23 satisfies the billâs requirements related to such agreements. 24 Additionally, the bill provides that, by August 1 following the 25 school year in which the out-of-state facility or out-of-state 26 provider provided services to a child pursuant to an agreement, 27 the childâs district of residence may submit an accounting 28 to DE that describes the cost of the services provided by 29 the facility or provider during such school year. The bill 30 requires that by August 15 following the school year in which 31 the out-of-state facility or out-of-state provider provided 32 services to a child pursuant to an agreement, DE shall review 33 and either approve or modify the accounting and make payment 34 to the childâs district of residence toward the school year in 35 -11- LSB 1126XL (12) 91 jda/jh 11/ 13 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ which the cost of the services was incurred. The bill provides 1 that any amounts paid by DE to school districts in this state 2 pursuant to these provisions shall be deducted on a monthly 3 basis from the state foundation aid paid under Code section 4 257.16 to all school districts in the state in the school year 5 following the school year in which the services were provided. 6 The portion of the total amount paid by DE to a district that 7 is required to be deducted from the state foundation aid paid 8 to the district is the same as the ratio that the budget 9 enrollment for the budget year of the district bears to the 10 total budget enrollment in the state for that budget year. 11 The bill defines âchildâ, âdistrict of residenceâ, and 12 âresidentâ. 13 DIVISION IV ââ ONLINE STATE JOB POSTING SYSTEM. Current 14 Code section 84A.6(4) requires the department of workforce 15 development (IWD), in consultation with DE, to establish a 16 system that allows DE, school districts, charter schools, 17 area education agencies, and accredited nonpublic schools to 18 post job openings on an internet site. Current Code section 19 84A.6(4) also requires DE, school districts, charter schools, 20 and area education agencies to submit all job openings to 21 IWD for posting on the internet site. Current Code section 22 84A.6(4) establishes requirements related to the job openings 23 system. The bill strikes Code section 84A.6(4) and enacts new 24 Code section 256.27, which transfers to DE the responsibilities 25 related to establishing and operating an online state job 26 posting system for school districts, charter schools, area 27 education agencies, and accredited nonpublic schools. 28 DIVISION V ââ TEACHER COMPENSATION. Current Code chapter 29 284 (teacher compensation) provides that the minimum annual 30 salary for a teacher who has at least 12 years of teaching 31 experience shall be at least $62,000. The bill provides 32 that if such a teacher has had a bona fide retirement from 33 employment with a covered employer as provided in Code section 34 97B.52A (bona fide retirement under IPERS), and has returned 35 -12- LSB 1126XL (12) 91 jda/jh 12/ 13 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ to covered employment with a covered employer as a licensed 1 teacher, the teacherâs minimum annual salary shall be $50,000. 2 -13- LSB 1126XL (12) 91 jda/jh 13/ 13
