5 EXPLANATION
6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
7 the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
8 Under current law, the department of inspections, appeals,
9 and licensing (DIAL) has the authority to collect payments
10 inappropriately obtained from the department of health and
11 human services. This bill expands those provisions to allow
12 DIAL to collect payments inappropriately obtained from the
13 department of homeland security and emergency management
14 (HSEM).
15 The bill makes benefits obtained through false, misleading,
16 incomplete, or inaccurate information given to HSEM a lien in
17 favor of the state upon a person’s property and requires county
18 recorders to prepare and maintain in the recorder’s office
19 an index of liens owed to HSEM. The bill requires DIAL to
20 collect delinquent debts owed HSEM as soon as practicable. By
21 operation of law, the associated provisions relating to lien
22 attachment, length, preservation, and satisfaction, payment
23 of recording fees by DIAL, distress warrants, and action by
24 the attorney general apply to the inappropriately obtained
25 HSEM benefits. HSEM may refer cases of suspected fraud from
26 the disaster aid individual assistance grant program and the
27 disaster case advocacy grant program to DIAL or other state
28 entities for review. If a person is convicted of fraud, the
29 state must review all legal options until HSEM recovers an
30 amount equal to the benefits fraudulently claimed. HSEM may
31 also refer suspected cases of impropriety in other programs to
32 the appropriate state entity.
