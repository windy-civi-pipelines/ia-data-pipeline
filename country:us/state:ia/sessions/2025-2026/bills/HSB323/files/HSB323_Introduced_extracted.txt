The 6 department shall forward a copy of the statement to the Iowa 7 Code editor prior to its publication in the Iowa administrative 8 bulletin. 9 EXPLANATION 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 11 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 12 GENERAL. This bill provides for the regulation of animal 13 feeding operations by the department of natural resources 14 (DNR), including the storage and application of manure 15 originating from such operations (Code chapter 459). An animal 16 feeding operation is an area or building in which agricultural 17 animals (cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys, or 18 fish) are confined for 45 days or more in any 12-month period, 19 and all associated structures used for the storage of manure. 20 A confinement feeding operation is an animal feeding operation 21 in which animals are confined to areas which are totally 22 roofed. Another form of animal feeding operation is an open 23 feedlot operation which confines animals without a roof or a 24 partial roof regulated by DNR (Code chapter 459A) and a dry 25 bedded confinement feeding operation which confines animals in 26 so-called hooped buildings (Code chapter 459B). 27 BACKGROUND ââ REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. Regulatory 28 requirements that apply to an animal feeding operation include 29 a number of requirements governing associated structures 30 including a confinement building housing agricultural animals, 31 and various types of structures storing manure which may be 32 made of material like concrete (formed) or that are primarily 33 earthen (unformed) and which may or may not be covered. 34 The regulations apply to manure in both a solid and liquid 35 -20- LSB 2959YC (3) 91 da/ns 20/ 25 H.F. _____ state. The regulations also apply to certain manure storage 1 structures, including a storage structure that is anaerobic, 2 meaning liquid manure is stored in a manner that utilizes 3 bacteria to break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen. 4 This process creates a biogas which is a type of renewable 5 fuel as well as a digestate which is a source of nutrients for 6 application on cropland. Code chapter 459 includes a number 7 of subchapters, including those that regulate air quality 8 and water quality. In both cases, the regulations require 9 separation distance requirements between an animal feeding 10 operation structure, including a manure storage structure, and 11 certain objects and locations. For purposes of air quality 12 regulations, these objects or locations include a residence, 13 commercial enterprise, a bona fide religious institution, an 14 educational institution, a public use area, or a public road. 15 Air quality regulations impose greater separation distance 16 requirements based on the date of initial construction and size 17 of the confinement feeding operation. Air quality regulations 18 also impose separation distance requirements between those 19 locations where manure is applied or stockpiled and those 20 same objects or locations. Water quality regulations include 21 requirements for the issuance of construction permits, and 22 construction design standards for manure storage structures. 23 Water quality requirements also impose separation distances 24 between animal feeding operation structures or dry manure 25 stockpiles and certain water sources. A person applying manure 26 originating from an animal feeding operation must file a plan 27 with DNR that demonstrates how manure is to be applied in a 28 manner that preserves water quality. For confinement feeding 29 operations, the plan is referred to as a manure management 30 plan (MMP) and for open feedlots the plan is referred to as a 31 nutrient management plan (NMP). 32 BACKGROUND ââ CIVIL PENALTIES. A person who violates an air 33 quality regulation or water quality regulation is subject to a 34 civil penalty based on a schedule established by DNR rule. The 35 -21- LSB 2959YC (3) 91 da/ns 21/ 25 H.F. _____ civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000 per violation. The civil 1 penalty for a water quality violation may also be subject to 2 a judicial civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each day of 3 such violation. 4 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ GENERAL. The bill provides for the 5 regulation of an anaerobic digester system which must include a 6 digester processing structure that primarily processes manure 7 but may also process other organic feedstocks, referred to as 8 digester feedstock. The structure is used to produce a biogas 9 which is a source of renewable fuel and a digestate which is a 10 nutrient-rich material that may be applied to cropland in a dry 11 or liquid state. 12 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ ANAEROBIC DIGESTER SYSTEM. An 13 anaerobic digester system is comprised of three steps. The 14 first step involves the storing of organic material (manure 15 and other organic feedstock) in a dry or liquid state awaiting 16 digestion. Manure is stored in a manure storage structure 17 unless it is dry and temporarily stored as a stockpile. Liquid 18 digester feedstock is stored in a digester feedstock storage 19 structure. All nonfarm digester feedstock must be stored in a 20 digester feedstock storage structure. The second step involves 21 digesting the organic material in a structure designed for 22 that purpose. The third step involves storing and applying 23 the processed organic material referred to as digestate. Dry 24 digestate may be stockpiled and liquid digestate must be 25 contained in a liquid digestate storage structure. The scope 26 of the bill is limited to the on-farm construction, including 27 expansion, of these structures, the on-farm use of stockpiles, 28 and the on-farm application of digestates. 29 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ TERMINOLOGY. The bill provides that 30 an anaerobic digester system must be identified with an animal 31 feeding operation. Identification occurs only if the anaerobic 32 digester system and the animal feeding operation are either (1) 33 under common ownership or management or (2) adjacent. In order 34 for an enforcement action to proceed against the anaerobic 35 -22- LSB 2959YC (3) 91 da/ns 22/ 25 H.F. _____ digester system and its identified animal feeding operation 1 for the same violation, the anaerobic digester system and 2 the identified animal feeding operation must be under common 3 ownership or management and be adjacent. Any reference in the 4 bill to a digester structure means a covered digester feedstock 5 storage structure, a covered digester processing structure, or 6 a covered liquid digestate storage structure. Any reference 7 to a digester stockpile refers to a dry digester feedstock 8 stockpile or a dry digestate stockpile. Any reference to 9 manure includes manure stored and discharged from a confinement 10 feeding operation and effluent stored and discharged from an 11 open feeding operation structure. A digester feedstock or 12 digestate is classified as dry only if digester feedstock or 13 digestate does not flow perceptibly under pressure, is not 14 capable of being transported through a mechanical pumping 15 device designed to move a liquid, and consists of molecules 16 that do not flow freely among themselves. A digester 17 processing structure must process manure as its primary source. 18 A digestate is not to be regulated as manure, unless it is 19 combined with manure. 20 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ CONSTRUCTION OF STRUCTURES. The 21 bill provides that a construction permit must be issued by 22 DNR prior to the construction of a digester structure. The 23 requirements are based on construction permit requirements 24 for manure storage structures. The application must include 25 an engineering report, construction plans, and specifications 26 prepared by a professional engineer or the natural resources 27 conservation service of the United States department of 28 agriculture. An application for a digester feedstock storage 29 structure must include information regarding its capacity 30 and the digester feedstock to be stored. An application for 31 the digester processing structure must include information 32 regarding the ownership or management of its identified animal 33 feeding operation, and the legal relationship between the 34 two entities. It must also include information regarding 35 -23- LSB 2959YC (3) 91 da/ns 23/ 25 H.F. _____ how digestate is to be applied, and how records are to be 1 maintained for DNR inspection. The bill also provides for 2 construction design standards for a formed or unformed digester 3 structure. The construction design standards must be based 4 on uniform standards such as available standards promulgated 5 by ASTM (American society for testing and materials) 6 international. The design standards for unformed digester 7 feedstock storage structures must account for the use of 8 linings and erosion controls. 9 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ AIR QUALITY ââ SEPARATION DISTANCE 10 REQUIREMENTS. The bill provides separation distance 11 requirements as part of air quality and water quality 12 standards. For air quality standards, the separation distance 13 requirements assume the anaerobic digester system and the 14 identified confinement feeding operation are part of a single 15 confinement feeding operation. The separation distance is 16 determined according to the date that the digester structure 17 was constructed or expanded subject to provisions allowing the 18 expansion of prior constructed confinement feeding operations 19 and exceptions to those separation distance requirements. 20 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ WATER QUALITY ââ MANURE MANAGEMENT. 21 The bill provides that if digestate is applied on land subject 22 to an MMP or NMP, such plan must be attached with a second 23 document referred to as a digestate management supplement. 24 The digestate management supplement must include information 25 necessary to determine the land area required for the 26 application of the digestate and the nutrient concentrations 27 of the digestate. 28 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ WATER QUALITY ââ SEPARATION DISTANCE 29 REQUIREMENTS. The bill provides that the separation distance 30 requirements and exceptions to those separation distance 31 requirements that apply to a confinement feeding operation 32 structure and an object or location also apply to a digester 33 structure and that same object or location. The bill allows a 34 person to stockpile dry digester feedstocks or dry digestate 35 -24- LSB 2959YC (3) 91 da/ns 24/ 25 H.F. _____ in the same manner as manure, subject to the same separation 1 distance requirements as manure. The bill requires that a 2 person must remove stockpiled dry digestate and apply it in the 3 same manner as manure. 4 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ WATER QUALITY ââ SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS. 5 The bill includes special requirements for stockpiling dry 6 digestate on certain karst terrain that are the same as 7 requirements for stockpiling dry manure. The bill also 8 provides for applying dry digestate on snow-covered or frozen 9 ground in compliance with state and federal water quality 10 standards. 11 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ CIVIL PENALTIES. The billâs provisions 12 that require separation distances between a digester structure 13 or a digester stockpile and a residence, commercial enterprise, 14 bona fide religious institution, or educational institution 15 are subject to a civil penalty for a violation of air quality 16 regulations. All other provisions of the bill are subject to a 17 civil penalty for a violation of water quality regulations. 18 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ EFFECTIVE DATE. The bill takes effect 19 upon enactment. 20 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ APPLICABILITY OF REGULATORY PRACTICE. 21 The bill requires DNR to regulate activities related to the 22 construction, expansion, and operation of anaerobic digester 23 systems in substantially the same manner DNR regulated 24 those activities on March 1, 2025, until the director of DNR 25 publishes a statement in the Iowa administrative bulletin 26 stating that all rules required to effectively administer and 27 enforce the provisions of the bill have been adopted. 28 -25- LSB 2959YC (3) 91 da/ns 25/ 25

An animal 16 feeding operation is an area or building in which agricultural 17 animals (cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys, or 18 fish) are confined for 45 days or more in any 12-month period, 19 and all associated structures used for the storage of manure. 20 A confinement feeding operation is an animal feeding operation 21 in which animals are confined to areas which are totally 22 roofed. Another form of animal feeding operation is an open 23 feedlot operation which confines animals without a roof or a 24 partial roof regulated by DNR (Code chapter 459A) and a dry 25 bedded confinement feeding operation which confines animals in 26 so-called hooped buildings (Code chapter 459B). 27 BACKGROUND ââ REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. Regulatory 28 requirements that apply to an animal feeding operation include 29 a number of requirements governing associated structures 30 including a confinement building housing agricultural animals, 31 and various types of structures storing manure which may be 32 made of material like concrete (formed) or that are primarily 33 earthen (unformed) and which may or may not be covered. 34 The regulations apply to manure in both a solid and liquid 35 -20- LSB 2959YC (3) 91 da/ns 20/ 25 H.F. _____ state. The regulations also apply to certain manure storage 1 structures, including a storage structure that is anaerobic, 2 meaning liquid manure is stored in a manner that utilizes 3 bacteria to break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen. 4 This process creates a biogas which is a type of renewable 5 fuel as well as a digestate which is a source of nutrients for 6 application on cropland. Code chapter 459 includes a number 7 of subchapters, including those that regulate air quality 8 and water quality. In both cases, the regulations require 9 separation distance requirements between an animal feeding 10 operation structure, including a manure storage structure, and 11 certain objects and locations. For purposes of air quality 12 regulations, these objects or locations include a residence, 13 commercial enterprise, a bona fide religious institution, an 14 educational institution, a public use area, or a public road. 15 Air quality regulations impose greater separation distance 16 requirements based on the date of initial construction and size 17 of the confinement feeding operation. Air quality regulations 18 also impose separation distance requirements between those 19 locations where manure is applied or stockpiled and those 20 same objects or locations. Water quality regulations include 21 requirements for the issuance of construction permits, and 22 construction design standards for manure storage structures. 23 Water quality requirements also impose separation distances 24 between animal feeding operation structures or dry manure 25 stockpiles and certain water sources. A person applying manure 26 originating from an animal feeding operation must file a plan 27 with DNR that demonstrates how manure is to be applied in a 28 manner that preserves water quality. For confinement feeding 29 operations, the plan is referred to as a manure management 30 plan (MMP) and for open feedlots the plan is referred to as a 31 nutrient management plan (NMP). 32 BACKGROUND ââ CIVIL PENALTIES. A person who violates an air 33 quality regulation or water quality regulation is subject to a 34 civil penalty based on a schedule established by DNR rule. The 35 -21- LSB 2959YC (3) 91 da/ns 21/ 25 H.F. _____ civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000 per violation. The civil 1 penalty for a water quality violation may also be subject to 2 a judicial civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each day of 3 such violation. 4 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ GENERAL. The bill provides for the 5 regulation of an anaerobic digester system which must include a 6 digester processing structure that primarily processes manure 7 but may also process other organic feedstocks, referred to as 8 digester feedstock. The structure is used to produce a biogas 9 which is a source of renewable fuel and a digestate which is a 10 nutrient-rich material that may be applied to cropland in a dry 11 or liquid state. 12 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ ANAEROBIC DIGESTER SYSTEM. An 13 anaerobic digester system is comprised of three steps. The 14 first step involves the storing of organic material (manure 15 and other organic feedstock) in a dry or liquid state awaiting 16 digestion. Manure is stored in a manure storage structure 17 unless it is dry and temporarily stored as a stockpile. Liquid 18 digester feedstock is stored in a digester feedstock storage 19 structure. All nonfarm digester feedstock must be stored in a 20 digester feedstock storage structure. The second step involves 21 digesting the organic material in a structure designed for 22 that purpose. The third step involves storing and applying 23 the processed organic material referred to as digestate. Dry 24 digestate may be stockpiled and liquid digestate must be 25 contained in a liquid digestate storage structure. The scope 26 of the bill is limited to the on-farm construction, including 27 expansion, of these structures, the on-farm use of stockpiles, 28 and the on-farm application of digestates. 29 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ TERMINOLOGY. The bill provides that 30 an anaerobic digester system must be identified with an animal 31 feeding operation. Identification occurs only if the anaerobic 32 digester system and the animal feeding operation are either (1) 33 under common ownership or management or (2) adjacent. In order 34 for an enforcement action to proceed against the anaerobic 35 -22- LSB 2959YC (3) 91 da/ns 22/ 25 H.F. _____ digester system and its identified animal feeding operation 1 for the same violation, the anaerobic digester system and 2 the identified animal feeding operation must be under common 3 ownership or management and be adjacent. Any reference in the 4 bill to a digester structure means a covered digester feedstock 5 storage structure, a covered digester processing structure, or 6 a covered liquid digestate storage structure. Any reference 7 to a digester stockpile refers to a dry digester feedstock 8 stockpile or a dry digestate stockpile. Any reference to 9 manure includes manure stored and discharged from a confinement 10 feeding operation and effluent stored and discharged from an 11 open feeding operation structure. A digester feedstock or 12 digestate is classified as dry only if digester feedstock or 13 digestate does not flow perceptibly under pressure, is not 14 capable of being transported through a mechanical pumping 15 device designed to move a liquid, and consists of molecules 16 that do not flow freely among themselves. A digester 17 processing structure must process manure as its primary source. 18 A digestate is not to be regulated as manure, unless it is 19 combined with manure. 20 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ CONSTRUCTION OF STRUCTURES. The 21 bill provides that a construction permit must be issued by 22 DNR prior to the construction of a digester structure. The 23 requirements are based on construction permit requirements 24 for manure storage structures. The application must include 25 an engineering report, construction plans, and specifications 26 prepared by a professional engineer or the natural resources 27 conservation service of the United States department of 28 agriculture. An application for a digester feedstock storage 29 structure must include information regarding its capacity 30 and the digester feedstock to be stored. An application for 31 the digester processing structure must include information 32 regarding the ownership or management of its identified animal 33 feeding operation, and the legal relationship between the 34 two entities. It must also include information regarding 35 -23- LSB 2959YC (3) 91 da/ns 23/ 25 H.F. _____ how digestate is to be applied, and how records are to be 1 maintained for DNR inspection. The bill also provides for 2 construction design standards for a formed or unformed digester 3 structure. The construction design standards must be based 4 on uniform standards such as available standards promulgated 5 by ASTM (American society for testing and materials) 6 international. The design standards for unformed digester 7 feedstock storage structures must account for the use of 8 linings and erosion controls. 9 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ AIR QUALITY ââ SEPARATION DISTANCE 10 REQUIREMENTS. The bill provides separation distance 11 requirements as part of air quality and water quality 12 standards. For air quality standards, the separation distance 13 requirements assume the anaerobic digester system and the 14 identified confinement feeding operation are part of a single 15 confinement feeding operation. The separation distance is 16 determined according to the date that the digester structure 17 was constructed or expanded subject to provisions allowing the 18 expansion of prior constructed confinement feeding operations 19 and exceptions to those separation distance requirements. 20 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ WATER QUALITY ââ MANURE MANAGEMENT. 21 The bill provides that if digestate is applied on land subject 22 to an MMP or NMP, such plan must be attached with a second 23 document referred to as a digestate management supplement. 24 The digestate management supplement must include information 25 necessary to determine the land area required for the 26 application of the digestate and the nutrient concentrations 27 of the digestate. 28 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ WATER QUALITY ââ SEPARATION DISTANCE 29 REQUIREMENTS. The bill provides that the separation distance 30 requirements and exceptions to those separation distance 31 requirements that apply to a confinement feeding operation 32 structure and an object or location also apply to a digester 33 structure and that same object or location. The bill allows a 34 person to stockpile dry digester feedstocks or dry digestate 35 -24- LSB 2959YC (3) 91 da/ns 24/ 25 H.F. _____ in the same manner as manure, subject to the same separation 1 distance requirements as manure. The bill requires that a 2 person must remove stockpiled dry digestate and apply it in the 3 same manner as manure. 4 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ WATER QUALITY ââ SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS. 5 The bill includes special requirements for stockpiling dry 6 digestate on certain karst terrain that are the same as 7 requirements for stockpiling dry manure. The bill also 8 provides for applying dry digestate on snow-covered or frozen 9 ground in compliance with state and federal water quality 10 standards. 11 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ CIVIL PENALTIES. The billâs provisions 12 that require separation distances between a digester structure 13 or a digester stockpile and a residence, commercial enterprise, 14 bona fide religious institution, or educational institution 15 are subject to a civil penalty for a violation of air quality 16 regulations. All other provisions of the bill are subject to a 17 civil penalty for a violation of water quality regulations. 18 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ EFFECTIVE DATE. The bill takes effect 19 upon enactment. 20 BILLâS PROVISIONS ââ APPLICABILITY OF REGULATORY PRACTICE. 21 The bill requires DNR to regulate activities related to the 22 construction, expansion, and operation of anaerobic digester 23 systems in substantially the same manner DNR regulated 24 those activities on March 1, 2025, until the director of DNR 25 publishes a statement in the Iowa administrative bulletin 26 stating that all rules required to effectively administer and 27 enforce the provisions of the bill have been adopted. 28 -25- LSB 2959YC (3) 91 da/ns 25/ 25
