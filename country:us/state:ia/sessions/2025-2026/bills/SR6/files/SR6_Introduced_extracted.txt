Adoption of a motion to 2 recess or adjourn to a specific time will not lift 3 the call. The call may be lifted, or a senator may 4 be excused from the call without lifting the call, by 5 a vote of a constitutional majority of the senators. 6 Those senators excused prior to the filing of the call 7 are excused from the call. 8 Rule 19 9 Committee of the Whole 10 The senate may resolve itself into a committee of 11 the whole senate when it wishes to permit more free and 12 informal discussion.

A 8 non-record roll call shall be requested by asking for a 9 âdivisionâ. A record roll call shall be requested by 10 asking for a ârecordâ. Upon request for a non-record 11 or record roll call vote, the president shall announce 12 that such a non-record or record roll call vote has 13 been requested and shall state the question to be put 14 to the senate. The president then shall direct the 15 secretary of the senate to receive the votes. 16 Senators present may cast their votes, either 17 by operating the voting mechanism located at their 18 assigned desk or by signaling the president if they are 19 unable to vote at their assigned desk. The president 20 shall enter the votes of senators signaling their 21 votes. 22 After ten minutes have elapsed for all senators 23 present to record their votes, the president shall 24 direct the secretary of the senate to close the voting 25 system. The president shall still enter the senatorsâ 26 votes at any time prior to directing the secretary of 27 the senate to lock the voting system.

Those senators called shall 22 vote âyeaâ âayeâ or ânoâ unless the senator states a 23 personal interest in the question or concludes that he 24 or she should not vote under the senate code of ethics. 25 A vote of âayeâ, âyeaâ, or âyesâ shall be recorded in 26 the senate journal as âyeaâ.

A motion to 12 reconsider an amendment to a main motion shall be taken 13 up for consideration only prior to the disposition of 14 the main motion or upon reconsideration of the main 15 motion. 16 A constitutional majority by a record roll call is 17 necessary to reconsider a bill or joint resolution. 18 During three legislative days from the date the motion 19 to reconsider a bill or resolution is filed, only the 20 mover may call it up.

The secretary of the senate shall 23 maintain a file of all appointments received from the 24 governor for confirmation. The file shall contain 25 a description of the duties and the compensation 26 for each nominee. The file shall show the date an 27 appointment was received from the governor, the date 28 the appointment was published in the journal, whether 29 the nominee has been introduced, whether a committee 30 -43- LSB 1935XS (13) 91 tm/jh 43/ 48 S.R. 6 report has been filed, when the senate questionnaire 1 was sent to the appointee, and shall include a copy of 2 the appointeeâs completed senate questionnaire, upon 3 receipt. 4 INVESTIGATING COMMITTEES. All appointments 5 received from the governor shall be referred to the 6 rules and administration committee by the secretary 7 of the senate on the same day they are published in 8 the senate journal. The rules and administration 9 committee shall establish an en bloc confirmation 10 calendar which must be filed with the secretary of 11 the senate. Within three (3) legislative days after 12 receiving an appointment, the committee shall either 13 place a nominee on the en bloc confirmation calendar 14 or assign the nominee to an appropriate standing 15 committee for further investigation, publishing notice 16 of such assignment in the senate journal for the next 17 legislative day. If the rules and administration 18 committee fails to take action on a nominee within 19 the three (3) legislative days, the nominee shall 20 automatically be placed on the en bloc confirmation 21 calendar. 22 Within the three (3) legislative days after an 23 appointment has been referred to the rules and 24 administration committee, any ten senators may require 25 that the nominee be assigned to an appropriate standing 26 committee by filing a written, signed request therefor 27 with the chairperson of the rules and administration 28 committee. The committee chair shall refer the 29 appointment to a subcommittee within three (3) 30 -44- LSB 1935XS (13) 91 tm/jh 44/ 48 S.R. 6 legislative days after a standing committee receives 1 an appointment for further investigation, publishing 2 notice of such assignment in the senate journal for the 3 next legislative day. Within ten (10) legislative days 4 after a standing committee receives an appointment for 5 further investigation the subcommittee shall file its 6 report with the standing committee. 7 Within fourteen (14) legislative days after a 8 standing committee receives an appointment for 9 further investigation, the committee shall conduct 10 an investigation of the nominee and file its report 11 thereon with the secretary of the senate, who shall 12 then place the nominee on the en bloc calendar or 13 individual confirmation calendar as directed by 14 the committee. The failure of a committee to file 15 its report within the prescribed time means that 16 the nominee is to be automatically placed, without 17 recommendation, upon the individual confirmation 18 calendar. 19 Any individual nominated to head a department or 20 agency of state government, whose appointment is 21 subject to senate confirmation, must be introduced 22 to the full senate prior to a vote on confirmation 23 of the nominee. Additionally, any five (5) senators 24 may request that any nominee be introduced to the 25 senate by filing a written request with the secretary 26 of the senate within ten (10) legislative days of 27 the nomineeâs name appearing in the journal. Any 28 individual nominated to a position requiring senate 29 confirmation may request to be introduced to the 30 -45- LSB 1935XS (13) 91 tm/jh 45/ 48 S.R. 6 full senate by notifying the secretary of the senate 1 at least one (1) legislative day in advance of the 2 nomineeâs appearance. If an individual is nominated 3 both to fill a vacancy for an unexpired term and is 4 also nominated for reappointment to that position 5 during the same session, a single introduction is 6 sufficient for eligibility for confirmation to both 7 terms. 8 HEARINGS. Any member of a committee investigating 9 an appointment may, within five (5) legislative days 10 after the committee receives the appointment, obtain 11 a hearing with the nominee by filing a written request 12 with the secretary of the senate who shall forward it 13 to the chair of the standing committee and the chair 14 of the subcommittee. Notice of the hearing shall be 15 published in the journal at least two (2) legislative 16 days prior to the hearing. At the hearing, which 17 shall be before the subcommittee, the nominee may be 18 questioned as to his or her qualifications to fulfill 19 the office to which nominated and further questioned 20 as to his or her viewpoints on issues facing the office 21 to which nominated. Any senator may at the discretion 22 of the chair of the subcommittee be permitted to submit 23 oral questions. The public may, at the discretion of 24 the investigating committee, be permitted to submit 25 oral or written statements as to the qualifications of 26 the nominee. 27 Also, within five (5) legislative days after the 28 subcommittee receives an appointment for investigation, 29 any senator may submit written questions to be answered 30 -46- LSB 1935XS (13) 91 tm/jh 46/ 48 S.R. 6 by the nominee prior to consideration of the nomineeâs 1 confirmation by the senate. 2 INFORMATIONAL MEETINGS. After a nominee has 3 been placed on the calendar and prior to the vote on 4 confirmation, any senator may request an informational 5 meeting on the nomination which shall be held before 6 the subcommittee. 7 VOTING ON CONFIRMATIONS. Appointments received from 8 the governor for senate confirmation during any session 9 of a general assembly shall be acted upon by April 10 15 as provided by section 2.32 of the Code. Upon the 11 motion of the majority leader or his or her designee, 12 the nominees on the en bloc confirmation calendar 13 shall be confirmed en bloc by the affirmative vote of 14 two-thirds of the members elected to the senate. The 15 journal shall reflect a single roll call accompanied by 16 a statement of the names of those individuals subject 17 to the en bloc confirmation vote. 18 Prior to an en bloc vote, any senator may request, 19 either in writing or from the floor, an individual vote 20 on any nominee on the en bloc confirmation calendar. 21 The senate shall vote separately on the nominee. 22 Nominees on the individual confirmation calendar 23 shall be confirmed by a two-thirds vote; however, the 24 senate shall take a separate roll call on each nominee, 25 unless by unanimous consent, it determines to take one 26 vote on all nominees under consideration. In any case, 27 the journal shall reflect a single roll call vote for 28 each nominee. 29 If an individual is nominated both to fill a vacancy 30 -47- LSB 1935XS (13) 91 tm/jh 47/ 48 S.R. 6 for an unexpired term and is also nominated for 1 reappointment to that position, and such appointment 2 and reappointment appear on the senate calendar as 3 eligible at the same time, a single vote is sufficient 4 for confirmation to both terms. 5 -48- LSB 1935XS (13) 91 tm/jh 48/ 48

A motion to strike out 24 and insert is indivisible; but a motion to strike out, 25 if lost, shall not preclude amendments to the matter 26 attempted to be stricken or a motion to strike out and 27 insert. 28 Rule 17 29 The Previous Question 30 -13- LSB 1935XS (13) 91 tm/jh 13/ 48 S.R. 6 The previous question shall be in this form: âShall 1 debate be closed on the pending question?â A motion 2 for the previous question may be adopted by a majority 3 of the senators present and voting.

A vote of 3 ânayâ or ânoâ shall be recorded in the senate journal 4 as ânoâ. 5 A non-record or record roll call vote may be 6 requested by any senator or ordered by the president 7 any time before the results are announced. A 8 non-record roll call shall be requested by asking for a 9 âdivisionâ. A record roll call shall be requested by 10 asking for a ârecordâ. Upon request for a non-record 11 or record roll call vote, the president shall announce 12 that such a non-record or record roll call vote has 13 been requested and shall state the question to be put 14 to the senate. The president then shall direct the 15 secretary of the senate to receive the votes. 16 Senators present may cast their votes, either 17 by operating the voting mechanism located at their 18 assigned desk or by signaling the president if they are 19 unable to vote at their assigned desk. The president 20 shall enter the votes of senators signaling their 21 votes. 22 After ten minutes have elapsed for all senators 23 present to record their votes, the president shall 24 direct the secretary of the senate to close the voting 25 system. The president shall still enter the senatorsâ 26 votes at any time prior to directing the secretary of 27 the senate to lock the voting system.

In the event the senate camera 11 system is not in operating order, debate in the senate 12 shall continue provided live audio is available on the 13 general assemblyâs internet site. 14 Rule 23 15 Duty of Voting 16 Every senator present when a question is put shall 17 vote âyeaâ âayeâ , ânoâ, or âpresentâ unless previously 18 excused by the senate.

Those senators called shall 22 vote âyeaâ âayeâ or ânoâ unless the senator states a 23 personal interest in the question or concludes that he 24 or she should not vote under the senate code of ethics. 25 A vote of âayeâ, âyeaâ, or âyesâ shall be recorded in 26 the senate journal as âyeaâ.

Such motion shall be in writing and 11 filed with the secretary of the senate. A motion to 12 reconsider an amendment to a main motion shall be taken 13 up for consideration only prior to the disposition of 14 the main motion or upon reconsideration of the main 15 motion. 16 A constitutional majority by a record roll call is 17 necessary to reconsider a bill or joint resolution. 18 During three legislative days from the date the motion 19 to reconsider a bill or resolution is filed, only the 20 mover may call it up. Thereafter, any senator may call 21 up the motion. If a date for adjournment has been set 22 by resolution of the senate, any senator may call up 23 a motion to reconsider at any time within three days 24 prior to the date set for adjournment. 25 If the motion to reconsider a bill or resolution 26 prevails, motions to reconsider amendments thereto 27 shall be in order and shall be disposed of without 28 delay. 29 A motion that any action taken by the senate be 30 -19- LSB 1935XS (13) 91 tm/jh 19/ 48 S.R. 6 reconsidered and the motion to reconsider be laid upon 1 the table shall be a single and indivisible motion, 2 known as the double-barreled motion, which, if carried, 3 shall have the effect of preventing reconsideration 4 unless a motion to take from the table prevails. 5 A constitutional majority is necessary for the 6 double-barreled motion to prevail on a bill or joint 7 resolution. The double-barreled motion can only be 8 made from the floor after the vote is announced and the 9 member who moved the final reading shall have priority 10 in making it. 11 A motion to reconsider and lay on the table shall 12 have priority over a motion to reconsider if they are 13 both filed on the same legislative day. 14 In the event that a motion to reconsider is pending 15 at the end of the first session or any extraordinary 16 session of any general assembly, or the general 17 assembly adjourns sine die, and the motion has not been 18 voted upon by the senate, it shall be determined to 19 have failed. 20 Rule 25 21 Suspension of Rules and Taking from Table 22 No standing rule or rules incorporated by reference 23 under Rule 3 or order of the senate shall be rescinded 24 or suspended, nor shall any matter, tabled upon 25 motion, be taken up, except by an affirmative vote of a 26 constitutional majority of the senate. 27 INTRODUCTION AND FORM OF BILLS 28 Rule 26 29 Time and Method of Introducing Bills and Amendments 30 -20- LSB 1935XS (13) 91 tm/jh 20/ 48 S.R. 6 All bills to be introduced in the senate shall be 1 typed in proper form by the legislative services agency 2 and shall be filed with the recording clerk. 3 All amendments shall be typed in proper form and 4 filed with the recording clerk not later than 4:30 5 p.m., or adjournment, whichever is later, in order to 6 be listed in the following dayâs clip sheet. 7 An âimpact amendmentâ is an amendment which 8 reasonably could have an annual effect of at least one 9 hundred thousand dollars or a combined total effect 10 within five years after enactment of five hundred 11 thousand dollars or more on the aggregate revenues, 12 expenditures or fiscal liability of the state or its 13 subdivisions. 14 An impact amendment to a bill which has been on 15 the calendar for at least three full legislative days 16 prior to its consideration shall not be taken up by the 17 senate unless: 18 1. a fiscal note is attached, and the amendment is 19 filed at least one legislative day prior to the date 20 set for consideration of the bill; or 21 2. the amendment is an appropriation or other 22 measure where the total effect is stated in dollar 23 amounts. 24 Rule 27 25 Limit on Introduction of Bills 26 No bill or joint resolution, except bills and 27 joint resolutions cosponsored by the majority and 28 minority floor leaders, or companion bills and joint 29 resolutions sponsored by the majority floor leaders of 30 -21- LSB 1935XS (13) 91 tm/jh 21/ 48 S.R. 6 both houses, shall be introduced in the senate after 1 4:30 p.m. on Friday of the fifth week of the first 2 regular session of a general assembly unless a formal 3 request for drafting the bill has been filed with the 4 legislative services agency before that time.

The file shall show the date an 27 appointment was received from the governor, the date 28 the appointment was published in the journal, whether 29 the nominee has been introduced, whether a committee 30 -43- LSB 1935XS (13) 91 tm/jh 43/ 48 S.R. 6 report has been filed, when the senate questionnaire 1 was sent to the appointee, and shall include a copy of 2 the appointeeâs completed senate questionnaire, upon 3 receipt. 4 INVESTIGATING COMMITTEES. All appointments 5 received from the governor shall be referred to the 6 rules and administration committee by the secretary 7 of the senate on the same day they are published in 8 the senate journal. The rules and administration 9 committee shall establish an en bloc confirmation 10 calendar which must be filed with the secretary of 11 the senate. Within three (3) legislative days after 12 receiving an appointment, the committee shall either 13 place a nominee on the en bloc confirmation calendar 14 or assign the nominee to an appropriate standing 15 committee for further investigation, publishing notice 16 of such assignment in the senate journal for the next 17 legislative day. If the rules and administration 18 committee fails to take action on a nominee within 19 the three (3) legislative days, the nominee shall 20 automatically be placed on the en bloc confirmation 21 calendar. 22 Within the three (3) legislative days after an 23 appointment has been referred to the rules and 24 administration committee, any ten senators may require 25 that the nominee be assigned to an appropriate standing 26 committee by filing a written, signed request therefor 27 with the chairperson of the rules and administration 28 committee.

Within ten (10) legislative days 4 after a standing committee receives an appointment for 5 further investigation the subcommittee shall file its 6 report with the standing committee. 7 Within fourteen (14) legislative days after a 8 standing committee receives an appointment for 9 further investigation, the committee shall conduct 10 an investigation of the nominee and file its report 11 thereon with the secretary of the senate, who shall 12 then place the nominee on the en bloc calendar or 13 individual confirmation calendar as directed by 14 the committee. The failure of a committee to file 15 its report within the prescribed time means that 16 the nominee is to be automatically placed, without 17 recommendation, upon the individual confirmation 18 calendar. 19 Any individual nominated to head a department or 20 agency of state government, whose appointment is 21 subject to senate confirmation, must be introduced 22 to the full senate prior to a vote on confirmation 23 of the nominee. Additionally, any five (5) senators 24 may request that any nominee be introduced to the 25 senate by filing a written request with the secretary 26 of the senate within ten (10) legislative days of 27 the nomineeâs name appearing in the journal. Any 28 individual nominated to a position requiring senate 29 confirmation may request to be introduced to the 30 -45- LSB 1935XS (13) 91 tm/jh 45/ 48 S.R. 6 full senate by notifying the secretary of the senate 1 at least one (1) legislative day in advance of the 2 nomineeâs appearance. If an individual is nominated 3 both to fill a vacancy for an unexpired term and is 4 also nominated for reappointment to that position 5 during the same session, a single introduction is 6 sufficient for eligibility for confirmation to both 7 terms. 8 HEARINGS. Any member of a committee investigating 9 an appointment may, within five (5) legislative days 10 after the committee receives the appointment, obtain 11 a hearing with the nominee by filing a written request 12 with the secretary of the senate who shall forward it 13 to the chair of the standing committee and the chair 14 of the subcommittee. Notice of the hearing shall be 15 published in the journal at least two (2) legislative 16 days prior to the hearing. At the hearing, which 17 shall be before the subcommittee, the nominee may be 18 questioned as to his or her qualifications to fulfill 19 the office to which nominated and further questioned 20 as to his or her viewpoints on issues facing the office 21 to which nominated. Any senator may at the discretion 22 of the chair of the subcommittee be permitted to submit 23 oral questions. The public may, at the discretion of 24 the investigating committee, be permitted to submit 25 oral or written statements as to the qualifications of 26 the nominee. 27 Also, within five (5) legislative days after the 28 subcommittee receives an appointment for investigation, 29 any senator may submit written questions to be answered 30 -46- LSB 1935XS (13) 91 tm/jh 46/ 48 S.R. 6 by the nominee prior to consideration of the nomineeâs 1 confirmation by the senate. 2 INFORMATIONAL MEETINGS. After a nominee has 3 been placed on the calendar and prior to the vote on 4 confirmation, any senator may request an informational 5 meeting on the nomination which shall be held before 6 the subcommittee. 7 VOTING ON CONFIRMATIONS. Appointments received from 8 the governor for senate confirmation during any session 9 of a general assembly shall be acted upon by April 10 15 as provided by section 2.32 of the Code. Upon the 11 motion of the majority leader or his or her designee, 12 the nominees on the en bloc confirmation calendar 13 shall be confirmed en bloc by the affirmative vote of 14 two-thirds of the members elected to the senate. The 15 journal shall reflect a single roll call accompanied by 16 a statement of the names of those individuals subject 17 to the en bloc confirmation vote. 18 Prior to an en bloc vote, any senator may request, 19 either in writing or from the floor, an individual vote 20 on any nominee on the en bloc confirmation calendar. 21 The senate shall vote separately on the nominee. 22 Nominees on the individual confirmation calendar 23 shall be confirmed by a two-thirds vote; however, the 24 senate shall take a separate roll call on each nominee, 25 unless by unanimous consent, it determines to take one 26 vote on all nominees under consideration. In any case, 27 the journal shall reflect a single roll call vote for 28 each nominee. 29 If an individual is nominated both to fill a vacancy 30 -47- LSB 1935XS (13) 91 tm/jh 47/ 48 S.R. 6 for an unexpired term and is also nominated for 1 reappointment to that position, and such appointment 2 and reappointment appear on the senate calendar as 3 eligible at the same time, a single vote is sufficient 4 for confirmation to both terms. 5 -48- LSB 1935XS (13) 91 tm/jh 48/ 48
