A proxy 1 advisory firm must submit an annual report to the treasurer of 2 state disclosing any vote inconsistent with the issuerâs board 3 of directorsâ recommendations and the economic analysis on 4 which the proxy advisory firm relied. 5 The bill permits an investor, beneficiary, or participant of 6 a plan to submit a request for the economic analysis conducted 7 for a fiduciaryâs vote to the investment company that owns 8 shares of an enterprise regulated by the state or the plan if 9 the individual has reason to believe the provisions of the bill 10 have not been met. The investment company or plan must respond 11 in writing within 90 days by providing the requested economic 12 analysis or informing the individual that no economic analysis 13 was conducted or the vote aligned with the recommendation 14 of the board of directors of the issuer of the shares. The 15 investment company or plan must provide such a response without 16 cost up to twice annually per consumer. 17 The bill allows the attorney general to investigate any 18 suspected violations of the bill and to enforce the billâs 19 provisions by initiating an action in the name of the state 20 and seeking civil penalties for each violation. Each share 21 not voted in the best economic interest of the shareholder 22 qualifies as a separate violation and constitutes irreparable 23 harm. The bill requires civil penalties to be in equity and 24 to not exceed $1,000 per violation. Civil penalties collected 25 under the bill are deposited in the general fund of the state. 26 The bill makes conforming changes. 27 -10- LSB 1056XD (2) 91 sc/ns 10/ 10

The bill creates the 1 rebuttable presumption that, if a fiduciaryâs vote aligns with 2 the recommendation of the board of directors of the issuer 3 of the shares or if the fiduciary or a third party conducts 4 and documents an economic analysis showing that the vote is 5 in the best economic interest of the plan participants and 6 beneficiaries, the vote is in the best interest of the plan 7 participants and beneficiaries. The bill prohibits a fiduciary 8 from voting shares of a plan based on any environmental, 9 social, policy, governance, or ideological goal that is 10 not in the best economic interest of plan participants and 11 beneficiaries. 12 The bill requires a fiduciary to annually report to 13 the treasurer of state any vote inconsistent with the 14 recommendation of an issuerâs board of directors and the 15 economic analysis on which the fiduciary relied. This report 16 must be certified by the fiduciaryâs chief executive officer 17 and chief financial officer. 18 The bill also requires a fiduciary to review its economic 19 analysis every three years to ensure that the fiduciaryâs 20 models, procedures, and processes predict the best economic 21 interest of the plan participants and beneficiaries. 22 The bill permits a court to award court costs and reasonable 23 attorney fees to the prevailing party in a suit concerning 24 fiduciary voting responsibilities under the bill. 25 The bill prohibits a proxy advisory firm from providing 26 proxy voting advice regarding shareholder-sponsored proposals 27 to an entity that the state regulates unless the advice is 28 based solely on the best economic interests of the enterpriseâs 29 shareholders. If a proxy advisory firmâs advice follows the 30 recommendation of the board of directors of the issuer of the 31 shares or if the proxy advisory firm conducts and documents an 32 economic analysis demonstrating that the vote is in the best 33 economic interest of the plan participants and beneficiaries, 34 then the advice is presumed to be based solely on the best 35 -9- LSB 1056XD (2) 91 sc/ns 9/ 10 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ economic interest of the enterpriseâs shareholders. A proxy 1 advisory firm must submit an annual report to the treasurer of 2 state disclosing any vote inconsistent with the issuerâs board 3 of directorsâ recommendations and the economic analysis on 4 which the proxy advisory firm relied. 5 The bill permits an investor, beneficiary, or participant of 6 a plan to submit a request for the economic analysis conducted 7 for a fiduciaryâs vote to the investment company that owns 8 shares of an enterprise regulated by the state or the plan if 9 the individual has reason to believe the provisions of the bill 10 have not been met. The investment company or plan must respond 11 in writing within 90 days by providing the requested economic 12 analysis or informing the individual that no economic analysis 13 was conducted or the vote aligned with the recommendation 14 of the board of directors of the issuer of the shares. The 15 investment company or plan must provide such a response without 16 cost up to twice annually per consumer. 17 The bill allows the attorney general to investigate any 18 suspected violations of the bill and to enforce the billâs 19 provisions by initiating an action in the name of the state 20 and seeking civil penalties for each violation. Each share 21 not voted in the best economic interest of the shareholder 22 qualifies as a separate violation and constitutes irreparable 23 harm. The bill requires civil penalties to be in equity and 24 to not exceed $1,000 per violation. Civil penalties collected 25 under the bill are deposited in the general fund of the state. 26 The bill makes conforming changes. 27 -10- LSB 1056XD (2) 91 sc/ns 10/ 10
