A co-provider 8 at a child development home may qualify for state child care 9 assistance if the person meets all the requirements specified 10 in this section and by the department by rule. 11 d. The parent, guardian, or custodian is not a substitute or 12 an assistant at a child care home or a child development home. 13 e. Based on the departmentâs evaluation of the parent, 14 guardian, or custodianâs application for state child care 15 assistance, the department has determined the parent, guardian, 16 or custodian has a need for child care. 17 f. The parent, guardian, or custodian is not the owner of 18 the child care facility or child care home where the children 19 are enrolled. 20 2. A director, co-director, or other administrative 21 staff member of a child care facility may qualify for state 22 child care assistance pursuant to subsection 1 if such person 23 is regularly counted in the minimum child-to-staff ratio 24 established by the department by rule. 25 3.

CHILD CARE CONTINUUM PARTNERSHIP GRANTS ââ 34 PILOT PROGRAM. The department of health and human services, 35 -20- LSB 1122XL (13) 91 jda/jh 20/ 26 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ in collaboration with early childhood Iowa area boards 1 created pursuant to section 256I.7 and the department of 2 education, shall create and administer a child care continuum 3 partnership grants pilot program. The pilot program shall 4 award competitive grants to partnerships between providers 5 of statewide voluntary preschool programming and child care 6 centers licensed pursuant to chapter 237A to provide full-day 7 early childhood education and care programming for participants 8 in the statewide voluntary preschool program created in 9 accordance with chapter 256C. The department of health and 10 human services shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A to 11 administer the child care continuum partnership grants pilot 12 program. 13 EXPLANATION 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 15 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 16 This bill relates to early childhood education and care, 17 including by modifying provisions related to the statewide 18 preschool program, the child development coordinating council, 19 programs for at-risk children, the responsibilities of 20 the department of education (DE), the early childhood Iowa 21 initiative, and the state child care assistance program, and 22 establishing the child care continuum partnership grants pilot 23 program within the department of health and human services 24 (HHS). 25 DIVISION I ââ STATEWIDE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. Under 26 current law, only school districts that meet certain 27 requirements established by the state board of education 28 are able to participate in the statewide preschool program 29 for four-year-old children established pursuant to Code 30 chapter 256C, although school districts may contract with 31 community-based providers. The bill authorizes community-based 32 providers to directly participate in the statewide preschool 33 program for four-year-old children established pursuant to 34 Code chapter 256C by applying with DE to implement a preschool 35 -21- LSB 1122XL (13) 91 jda/jh 21/ 26 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ program. The state board is required to adopt rules to 1 further define the requirements of community-based providers 2 implementing the preschool program. 3 Under current law, state funding provided under the 4 statewide preschool program for four-year-old children is 5 provided to school districts based upon the number of eligible 6 students enrolled in the preschool programming provided by 7 the school district. Also under current law, if the school 8 district contracts with a community-based provider, state 9 funding passes from the school district to the community-based 10 provider. The bill allows a community-based provider approved 11 to directly participate in the preschool program to be paid 12 preschool foundation aid directly in the same manner as a 13 school district. The bill establishes the amount of preschool 14 foundation aid that is payable to such a community-based 15 provider for the initial school year for which the 16 community-based provider is approved to directly participate in 17 the preschool program, and for subsequent school years. 18 The bill makes conforming changes. 19 DIVISION II ââ CHILD DEVELOPMENT COORDINATING COUNCIL AND 20 PROGRAMS FOR AT-RISK CHILDREN. Current Code chapter 256A 21 establishes the child development coordinating council to 22 promote the provision of child development services to at-risk 23 three-year-old and four-year-old children. The bill strikes 24 transfers all of the responsibilities of the child development 25 coordinating council to DE and makes conforming changes. 26 Current law requires the child development coordinating 27 council to establish minimum guidelines for comprehensive early 28 child development services for at-risk three-year-old and 29 four-year-old children. Current law also requires the child 30 development coordinating council to develop an inventory of 31 child development services provided to at-risk three-year-old 32 and four-year-old children in this state that identifies the 33 number of children who are not receiving these services. 34 Additionally, current law requires the child development 35 -22- LSB 1122XL (13) 91 jda/jh 22/ 26 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ coordinating council to encourage the establishment of programs 1 that will enhance the skills of parents in parenting and in 2 providing for the learning and development of their children. 3 Also, current law requires the child development coordinating 4 council to develop a resource directory of parent involvement 5 programs to assist districts in planning family support 6 programs. The bill strikes these provisions and does not 7 transfer these responsibilities to DE. 8 Current law requires the director of the department of 9 education to develop standards and instructional materials to 10 assist school districts in development of appropriate before 11 and after school programs for elementary school children, child 12 care services and programs to complement half-day and all-day 13 kindergarten programs, curricula for all-day kindergarten 14 programs, and curricula for the early elementary grades one 15 through three. Current law also requires the director to 16 assist prekindergarten instructors in the development of 17 appropriate curricula and teaching practices. In developing 18 these standards and materials, current law requires the 19 director to consult with the child development coordinating 20 council, the department of health and human services, the state 21 board of regents center for early developmental education, the 22 area education agencies, the department of human development 23 and family studies in the college of human sciences at 24 Iowa state university of science and technology, the early 25 childhood elementary division of the college of education at 26 the university of Iowa, and the college of education at the 27 university of northern Iowa. The bill strikes the provision 28 related to persons the director is required to consult with in 29 developing these standards and materials. 30 Current Code section 279.51(1)(b) provides that for the 31 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2007, and for each succeeding 32 fiscal year, $8,536,740 of the funds appropriated from the 33 general fund of the state to DE under Code section 279.51(1) 34 (programs for at-risk children) shall be allocated to the child 35 -23- LSB 1122XL (13) 91 jda/jh 23/ 26 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ development coordinating council for the purposes set out in 1 Code section 279.51(2) and Code section 256A.3 (duties of 2 child development coordinating council). The bill modifies 3 Code section 279.51(1)(b) to provide that the moneys shall be 4 allocated to DE for purposes set out in Code section 279.51(2), 5 Code section 256A.3, as modified in the bill, and to be 6 used as grants to early childhood programs that demonstrate 7 the greatest need for programs for at-risk children and the 8 families of at-risk children. 9 Under current law, the moneys allocated under Code 10 section 279.51(1)(b) may be used by the child development 11 coordinating council to award grants to school districts to 12 establish programs for three-year-old, four-year-old, and 13 five-year-old at-risk children, and to provide grants to 14 provide educational support services to parents of at-risk 15 children age birth through three years. The bill modifies Code 16 section 279.51(1)(b) to provide that such moneys may be used by 17 DE to award grants to school districts to establish programs 18 for three-year-old and four-year-old at-risk children. 19 Current law requires DE to seek assistance from foundations 20 and public and private agencies in the evaluation of the 21 programs funded under Code section 279.51 (programs for at-risk 22 children), and in the provision of support to school districts 23 in developing and implementing the programs funded under Code 24 section 279.51. The bill strikes this provision. 25 DIVISION III ââ DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION RESPONSIBILITIES. 26 The bill requires the director of DE to review and conduct 27 research related to the most effective evidence-based 28 curricula, instructional materials, and evidence-based 29 or promising practices used in prekindergarten programs 30 and in preschools, and make a list of the most effective 31 evidence-based curricula, instructional materials, and 32 evidence-based or promising practices for prekindergarten 33 programs and preschools available on the DEâs internet site. 34 The bill requires the director of DE to develop a preschool 35 -24- LSB 1122XL (13) 91 jda/jh 24/ 26 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ accountability system representing, at minimum, developmental 1 and learning outcomes and continuous implementation of 2 high-quality program standards for school districts offering a 3 prekindergarten program, accredited nonpublic schools offering 4 a prekindergarten program, prekindergarten and preschool 5 programs serving children with individualized education 6 programs, and preschool programs created in accordance with 7 Code chapters 256A and 256C. The director is also required 8 to provide, in coordination with HHS, an alignment of an 9 outcomes-based accountability system for school districts 10 offering a prekindergarten program, accredited nonpublic 11 schools offering a prekindergarten program, preschool programs 12 serving children with individualized education programs, and 13 preschool programs created in accordance with Code chapters 14 256A and 256C. 15 The bill requires the director of DE to review and revise 16 the state early learning standards and standards related 17 to preschool programs serving children with individualized 18 education programs and preschool programs created in accordance 19 with Code chapters 256A and 256C. The bill also requires the 20 director of DE to provide professional development services 21 to assist such programs in implementing the revised early 22 learning standards, preschool assessments, high-quality program 23 standards, and standards related to preschool programs. 24 DIVISION IV ââ EARLY CHILDHOOD IOWA INITIATIVE. In general, 25 the early childhood Iowa program established under Code 26 chapter 256I within HHS provides leadership for facilitation, 27 communication, and coordination for the early childhood Iowa 28 initiative activities and funding and for improvement of the 29 early care, education, health, and human services systems. 30 Current law requires the early childhood Iowa state board to 31 approve the geographic boundaries for the early childhood Iowa 32 areas throughout the state and any changes in the boundaries. 33 The bill provides that, by January 1, 2026, HHS shall designate 34 early childhood Iowa areas in the same number and using the 35 -25- LSB 1122XL (13) 91 jda/jh 25/ 26 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ same geographic boundaries as the behavioral health districts 1 designated by HHS pursuant to Code section 225A.4 (behavioral 2 health service system ââ districts and administrative 3 organizations). The bill makes conforming changes. 4 DIVISION V ââ CHILD CARE WORKFORCE ââ STATE CHILD CARE 5 ASSISTANCE ELIGIBILITY. The bill provides that a child shall 6 be eligible for the state child care assistance program under 7 Code section 237A.13 if a parent, guardian, or custodian meets 8 certain specified requirements established in the bill. A 9 director, co-director, or other administrative staff member 10 of a child care facility may qualify for the state child 11 care assistance program if such person is regularly counted 12 in the minimum child-to-staff ratio established by HHS. The 13 bill requires a person participating in the state child care 14 assistance program pursuant to eligibility established under 15 the billâs provisions to make copayments based on the personâs 16 household income for services received from the program. 17 DIVISION VI ââ CHILD CARE CONTINUUM PARTNERSHIP GRANTS 18 ââ PILOT PROGRAM. The bill requires HHS, in collaboration 19 with early childhood Iowa area boards and DE, to create and 20 administer a child care continuum partnership grants pilot 21 program. The pilot program shall award competitive grants to 22 partnerships between providers of statewide voluntary preschool 23 programming and licensed child care centers to provide full-day 24 early childhood education and care programming for participants 25 in the statewide voluntary preschool program. 26 -26- LSB 1122XL (13) 91 jda/jh 26/ 26

If the parent, guardian, or custodian is employed at 5 a child care home or a child development home, the parent, 6 guardian, or custodian does not provide child care to the 7 parent, guardian, or custodianâs own child. A co-provider 8 at a child development home may qualify for state child care 9 assistance if the person meets all the requirements specified 10 in this section and by the department by rule. 11 d. The parent, guardian, or custodian is not a substitute or 12 an assistant at a child care home or a child development home. 13 e. Based on the departmentâs evaluation of the parent, 14 guardian, or custodianâs application for state child care 15 assistance, the department has determined the parent, guardian, 16 or custodian has a need for child care. 17 f.

CHILD CARE CONTINUUM PARTNERSHIP GRANTS ââ 34 PILOT PROGRAM. The department of health and human services, 35 -20- LSB 1122XL (13) 91 jda/jh 20/ 26 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ in collaboration with early childhood Iowa area boards 1 created pursuant to section 256I.7 and the department of 2 education, shall create and administer a child care continuum 3 partnership grants pilot program. The pilot program shall 4 award competitive grants to partnerships between providers 5 of statewide voluntary preschool programming and child care 6 centers licensed pursuant to chapter 237A to provide full-day 7 early childhood education and care programming for participants 8 in the statewide voluntary preschool program created in 9 accordance with chapter 256C. The department of health and 10 human services shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A to 11 administer the child care continuum partnership grants pilot 12 program. 13 EXPLANATION 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 15 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 16 This bill relates to early childhood education and care, 17 including by modifying provisions related to the statewide 18 preschool program, the child development coordinating council, 19 programs for at-risk children, the responsibilities of 20 the department of education (DE), the early childhood Iowa 21 initiative, and the state child care assistance program, and 22 establishing the child care continuum partnership grants pilot 23 program within the department of health and human services 24 (HHS). 25 DIVISION I ââ STATEWIDE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. Under 26 current law, only school districts that meet certain 27 requirements established by the state board of education 28 are able to participate in the statewide preschool program 29 for four-year-old children established pursuant to Code 30 chapter 256C, although school districts may contract with 31 community-based providers. The bill authorizes community-based 32 providers to directly participate in the statewide preschool 33 program for four-year-old children established pursuant to 34 Code chapter 256C by applying with DE to implement a preschool 35 -21- LSB 1122XL (13) 91 jda/jh 21/ 26 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ program. The state board is required to adopt rules to 1 further define the requirements of community-based providers 2 implementing the preschool program. 3 Under current law, state funding provided under the 4 statewide preschool program for four-year-old children is 5 provided to school districts based upon the number of eligible 6 students enrolled in the preschool programming provided by 7 the school district. Also under current law, if the school 8 district contracts with a community-based provider, state 9 funding passes from the school district to the community-based 10 provider. The bill allows a community-based provider approved 11 to directly participate in the preschool program to be paid 12 preschool foundation aid directly in the same manner as a 13 school district. The bill establishes the amount of preschool 14 foundation aid that is payable to such a community-based 15 provider for the initial school year for which the 16 community-based provider is approved to directly participate in 17 the preschool program, and for subsequent school years. 18 The bill makes conforming changes. 19 DIVISION II ââ CHILD DEVELOPMENT COORDINATING COUNCIL AND 20 PROGRAMS FOR AT-RISK CHILDREN. Current Code chapter 256A 21 establishes the child development coordinating council to 22 promote the provision of child development services to at-risk 23 three-year-old and four-year-old children. The bill strikes 24 transfers all of the responsibilities of the child development 25 coordinating council to DE and makes conforming changes. 26 Current law requires the child development coordinating 27 council to establish minimum guidelines for comprehensive early 28 child development services for at-risk three-year-old and 29 four-year-old children. Current law also requires the child 30 development coordinating council to develop an inventory of 31 child development services provided to at-risk three-year-old 32 and four-year-old children in this state that identifies the 33 number of children who are not receiving these services. 34 Additionally, current law requires the child development 35 -22- LSB 1122XL (13) 91 jda/jh 22/ 26 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ coordinating council to encourage the establishment of programs 1 that will enhance the skills of parents in parenting and in 2 providing for the learning and development of their children. 3 Also, current law requires the child development coordinating 4 council to develop a resource directory of parent involvement 5 programs to assist districts in planning family support 6 programs. The bill strikes these provisions and does not 7 transfer these responsibilities to DE. 8 Current law requires the director of the department of 9 education to develop standards and instructional materials to 10 assist school districts in development of appropriate before 11 and after school programs for elementary school children, child 12 care services and programs to complement half-day and all-day 13 kindergarten programs, curricula for all-day kindergarten 14 programs, and curricula for the early elementary grades one 15 through three. Current law also requires the director to 16 assist prekindergarten instructors in the development of 17 appropriate curricula and teaching practices. In developing 18 these standards and materials, current law requires the 19 director to consult with the child development coordinating 20 council, the department of health and human services, the state 21 board of regents center for early developmental education, the 22 area education agencies, the department of human development 23 and family studies in the college of human sciences at 24 Iowa state university of science and technology, the early 25 childhood elementary division of the college of education at 26 the university of Iowa, and the college of education at the 27 university of northern Iowa. The bill strikes the provision 28 related to persons the director is required to consult with in 29 developing these standards and materials. 30 Current Code section 279.51(1)(b) provides that for the 31 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2007, and for each succeeding 32 fiscal year, $8,536,740 of the funds appropriated from the 33 general fund of the state to DE under Code section 279.51(1) 34 (programs for at-risk children) shall be allocated to the child 35 -23- LSB 1122XL (13) 91 jda/jh 23/ 26 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ development coordinating council for the purposes set out in 1 Code section 279.51(2) and Code section 256A.3 (duties of 2 child development coordinating council). The bill modifies 3 Code section 279.51(1)(b) to provide that the moneys shall be 4 allocated to DE for purposes set out in Code section 279.51(2), 5 Code section 256A.3, as modified in the bill, and to be 6 used as grants to early childhood programs that demonstrate 7 the greatest need for programs for at-risk children and the 8 families of at-risk children. 9 Under current law, the moneys allocated under Code 10 section 279.51(1)(b) may be used by the child development 11 coordinating council to award grants to school districts to 12 establish programs for three-year-old, four-year-old, and 13 five-year-old at-risk children, and to provide grants to 14 provide educational support services to parents of at-risk 15 children age birth through three years. The bill modifies Code 16 section 279.51(1)(b) to provide that such moneys may be used by 17 DE to award grants to school districts to establish programs 18 for three-year-old and four-year-old at-risk children. 19 Current law requires DE to seek assistance from foundations 20 and public and private agencies in the evaluation of the 21 programs funded under Code section 279.51 (programs for at-risk 22 children), and in the provision of support to school districts 23 in developing and implementing the programs funded under Code 24 section 279.51. The bill strikes this provision. 25 DIVISION III ââ DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION RESPONSIBILITIES. 26 The bill requires the director of DE to review and conduct 27 research related to the most effective evidence-based 28 curricula, instructional materials, and evidence-based 29 or promising practices used in prekindergarten programs 30 and in preschools, and make a list of the most effective 31 evidence-based curricula, instructional materials, and 32 evidence-based or promising practices for prekindergarten 33 programs and preschools available on the DEâs internet site. 34 The bill requires the director of DE to develop a preschool 35 -24- LSB 1122XL (13) 91 jda/jh 24/ 26 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ accountability system representing, at minimum, developmental 1 and learning outcomes and continuous implementation of 2 high-quality program standards for school districts offering a 3 prekindergarten program, accredited nonpublic schools offering 4 a prekindergarten program, prekindergarten and preschool 5 programs serving children with individualized education 6 programs, and preschool programs created in accordance with 7 Code chapters 256A and 256C. The director is also required 8 to provide, in coordination with HHS, an alignment of an 9 outcomes-based accountability system for school districts 10 offering a prekindergarten program, accredited nonpublic 11 schools offering a prekindergarten program, preschool programs 12 serving children with individualized education programs, and 13 preschool programs created in accordance with Code chapters 14 256A and 256C. 15 The bill requires the director of DE to review and revise 16 the state early learning standards and standards related 17 to preschool programs serving children with individualized 18 education programs and preschool programs created in accordance 19 with Code chapters 256A and 256C. The bill also requires the 20 director of DE to provide professional development services 21 to assist such programs in implementing the revised early 22 learning standards, preschool assessments, high-quality program 23 standards, and standards related to preschool programs. 24 DIVISION IV ââ EARLY CHILDHOOD IOWA INITIATIVE. In general, 25 the early childhood Iowa program established under Code 26 chapter 256I within HHS provides leadership for facilitation, 27 communication, and coordination for the early childhood Iowa 28 initiative activities and funding and for improvement of the 29 early care, education, health, and human services systems. 30 Current law requires the early childhood Iowa state board to 31 approve the geographic boundaries for the early childhood Iowa 32 areas throughout the state and any changes in the boundaries. 33 The bill provides that, by January 1, 2026, HHS shall designate 34 early childhood Iowa areas in the same number and using the 35 -25- LSB 1122XL (13) 91 jda/jh 25/ 26 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ same geographic boundaries as the behavioral health districts 1 designated by HHS pursuant to Code section 225A.4 (behavioral 2 health service system ââ districts and administrative 3 organizations). The bill makes conforming changes. 4 DIVISION V ââ CHILD CARE WORKFORCE ââ STATE CHILD CARE 5 ASSISTANCE ELIGIBILITY. The bill provides that a child shall 6 be eligible for the state child care assistance program under 7 Code section 237A.13 if a parent, guardian, or custodian meets 8 certain specified requirements established in the bill. A 9 director, co-director, or other administrative staff member 10 of a child care facility may qualify for the state child 11 care assistance program if such person is regularly counted 12 in the minimum child-to-staff ratio established by HHS. The 13 bill requires a person participating in the state child care 14 assistance program pursuant to eligibility established under 15 the billâs provisions to make copayments based on the personâs 16 household income for services received from the program. 17 DIVISION VI ââ CHILD CARE CONTINUUM PARTNERSHIP GRANTS 18 ââ PILOT PROGRAM. The bill requires HHS, in collaboration 19 with early childhood Iowa area boards and DE, to create and 20 administer a child care continuum partnership grants pilot 21 program. The pilot program shall award competitive grants to 22 partnerships between providers of statewide voluntary preschool 23 programming and licensed child care centers to provide full-day 24 early childhood education and care programming for participants 25 in the statewide voluntary preschool program. 26 -26- LSB 1122XL (13) 91 jda/jh 26/ 26
