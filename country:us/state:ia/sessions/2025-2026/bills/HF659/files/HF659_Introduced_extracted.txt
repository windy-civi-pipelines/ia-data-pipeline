The bill 6 creates an Iowa housing tax credit program available against 7 the individual and corporate income taxes, franchise tax, 8 insurance premium tax, and moneys and credits tax. 9 The bill requires the Iowa finance authority (authority) to 10 develop a system for the application, review, and authorization 11 of Iowa housing tax credits. A tax credit may be claimed by 12 a taxpayer for a âqualified developmentâ defined to mean a 13 qualified low-income housing project under section 42(g) of the 14 Internal Revenue Code that is financed by tax-exempt bonds. 15 An Iowa housing tax credit may be authorized by the authority 16 if all of the following apply: the tax credit is issued to 17 a taxpayer who has an ownership interest in the qualified 18 development; the tax credit amount is allocated pursuant to 19 a qualified allocation plan adopted by the authority; the 20 tax credit is necessary for the financial feasibility of the 21 qualified development; the amount of the tax credit allocated 22 to an owner shall not exceed 30 percent of the qualified basis 23 of the qualified development; and the qualified development is 24 the subject of a recorded restrictive covenant requiring the 25 qualified development be maintained and operated as a qualified 26 development for a certain number of years. 27 The amount of an Iowa housing tax credit award is determined 28 by the authority and may be claimed during the credit period 29 (10 years), and any credit in excess of the taxpayerâs 30 liability for the tax year is not refundable but may be 31 credited to the tax liability for the following five years. 32 In any calendar year, the bill limits the aggregate amount 33 of the tax credit to $15 million plus the sum of the total of 34 unallocated tax credits from the preceding calendar year and 35 -9- LSB 2608YH (5) 91 jm/jh 9/ 12 H.F. 659 the previously allocated tax credits that have been revoked, 1 canceled, or recaptured. 2 A taxpayer shall claim the credit by including one or more 3 tax certificates issued by the authority with the taxpayerâs 4 return. The bill allows a tax credit certificate to be 5 transferred to any person or entity. The bill requires the 6 transferee to submit the transferred tax credit certificate to 7 the authority within 90 days of the transfer, and requires the 8 authority to issue a replacement tax credit certificate within 9 30 days of receiving the transferred tax credit certificate. 10 The bill allows the authority to recapture tax credit 11 amounts from previously issued tax credits, if on the last day 12 of a taxable year during the compliance period (15 years), if 13 the amount of the qualified basis of a qualified development 14 owned by a taxpayer claiming the credit is less than the amount 15 of the qualified basis as of the last day of the immediately 16 preceding tax year, the amount of the taxpayerâs liability 17 shall be increased by the recapture amount determined using the 18 method under section 42(j) of the Internal Revenue Code. If 19 a recapture event occurs, the bill requires the taxpayer to 20 include the recaptured amount on the return submitted for the 21 tax year in which the recapture event is identified. 22 The bill requires the authority to submit a report to the 23 general assembly by January 31 each year, detailing the Iowa 24 housing tax credit program. 25 The division takes effect January 1, 2026, and applies to tax 26 years beginning on or after that date. 27 DIVISION II ââ FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYER SAVINGS ACCOUNTS. The 28 bill makes changes to the income tax benefits related to 29 contributions made to a first-time homebuyer savings account. 30 Under current law, for married persons filing a joint return 31 an account holder is allowed to deduct the first $4,000 of 32 contributions made to an account during the tax year if the 33 account holder also maintains a joint first-time homebuyer 34 savings account, and for any other person the account holder 35 -10- LSB 2608YH (5) 91 jm/jh 10/ 12 H.F. 659 is allowed to deduct for the first $2,000 of contributions 1 made to such an account during the tax year. The first-time 2 homebuyer savings account annual deduction limits are indexed 3 to inflation and are increased each year. For the 2024 tax 4 year the annual deduction limit for married persons filing a 5 joint return is $4,512, and for all other persons the limit is 6 $2,256. 7 The bill increases the annual deduction limit for first-time 8 homebuyer savings account contributions to $10,000 for married 9 persons filing a joint return, and to $5,000 for any other 10 account holder. The new annual deduction limits in the bill 11 are also indexed to inflation and are increased each year. 12 DIVISION III ââ NEIGHBORHOOD RENOVATION GRANT PROGRAM. 13 The bill establishes a neighborhood housing renovation 14 grant program (program) and fund (neighborhood fund) to 15 be administered by the authority for purposes of awarding 16 grants to eligible homeowners for qualifying exterior home 17 improvements, repairs, or renovations (exterior work). 18 There is appropriated to the authority for deposit in the 19 neighborhood fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025, 20 from the general fund of the state, the sum of $50 million. 21 Notwithstanding Code section 12C.7(2), interest or earnings on 22 moneys in the neighborhood fund shall accrue to the authority 23 and shall be used for purposes of the program. Notwithstanding 24 Code section 8.33, moneys in the neighborhood fund at the end 25 of each fiscal year shall not revert to any other fund but 26 shall remain in the neighborhood fund for expenditure for 27 subsequent fiscal years. All repayments or recaptures of the 28 grants awarded under the program shall accrue to the authority 29 and shall be used for purposes of the program. 30 The authority shall not use more than 3 percent of the moneys 31 in the neighborhood fund at the beginning of the fiscal year 32 for purposes of administrative costs, marketing, and other 33 program support. 34 To qualify for the program, a homeownerâs household income 35 -11- LSB 2608YH (5) 91 jm/jh 11/ 12 H.F. 659 shall not exceed $109,000 and the homeowner must occupy the 1 property at which the exterior work will occur.

Exterior 3 work that qualifies for the program is detailed in the bill. 4 The authority shall adopt rules to administer the division. 5 -12- LSB 2608YH (5) 91 jm/jh 12/ 12

The bill 6 creates an Iowa housing tax credit program available against 7 the individual and corporate income taxes, franchise tax, 8 insurance premium tax, and moneys and credits tax. 9 The bill requires the Iowa finance authority (authority) to 10 develop a system for the application, review, and authorization 11 of Iowa housing tax credits. A tax credit may be claimed by 12 a taxpayer for a âqualified developmentâ defined to mean a 13 qualified low-income housing project under section 42(g) of the 14 Internal Revenue Code that is financed by tax-exempt bonds. 15 An Iowa housing tax credit may be authorized by the authority 16 if all of the following apply: the tax credit is issued to 17 a taxpayer who has an ownership interest in the qualified 18 development; the tax credit amount is allocated pursuant to 19 a qualified allocation plan adopted by the authority; the 20 tax credit is necessary for the financial feasibility of the 21 qualified development; the amount of the tax credit allocated 22 to an owner shall not exceed 30 percent of the qualified basis 23 of the qualified development; and the qualified development is 24 the subject of a recorded restrictive covenant requiring the 25 qualified development be maintained and operated as a qualified 26 development for a certain number of years. 27 The amount of an Iowa housing tax credit award is determined 28 by the authority and may be claimed during the credit period 29 (10 years), and any credit in excess of the taxpayerâs 30 liability for the tax year is not refundable but may be 31 credited to the tax liability for the following five years. 32 In any calendar year, the bill limits the aggregate amount 33 of the tax credit to $15 million plus the sum of the total of 34 unallocated tax credits from the preceding calendar year and 35 -9- LSB 2608YH (5) 91 jm/jh 9/ 12 H.F. 659 the previously allocated tax credits that have been revoked, 1 canceled, or recaptured. 2 A taxpayer shall claim the credit by including one or more 3 tax certificates issued by the authority with the taxpayerâs 4 return. The bill allows a tax credit certificate to be 5 transferred to any person or entity. The bill requires the 6 transferee to submit the transferred tax credit certificate to 7 the authority within 90 days of the transfer, and requires the 8 authority to issue a replacement tax credit certificate within 9 30 days of receiving the transferred tax credit certificate. 10 The bill allows the authority to recapture tax credit 11 amounts from previously issued tax credits, if on the last day 12 of a taxable year during the compliance period (15 years), if 13 the amount of the qualified basis of a qualified development 14 owned by a taxpayer claiming the credit is less than the amount 15 of the qualified basis as of the last day of the immediately 16 preceding tax year, the amount of the taxpayerâs liability 17 shall be increased by the recapture amount determined using the 18 method under section 42(j) of the Internal Revenue Code. If 19 a recapture event occurs, the bill requires the taxpayer to 20 include the recaptured amount on the return submitted for the 21 tax year in which the recapture event is identified. 22 The bill requires the authority to submit a report to the 23 general assembly by January 31 each year, detailing the Iowa 24 housing tax credit program. 25 The division takes effect January 1, 2026, and applies to tax 26 years beginning on or after that date. 27 DIVISION II ââ FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYER SAVINGS ACCOUNTS. The 28 bill makes changes to the income tax benefits related to 29 contributions made to a first-time homebuyer savings account. 30 Under current law, for married persons filing a joint return 31 an account holder is allowed to deduct the first $4,000 of 32 contributions made to an account during the tax year if the 33 account holder also maintains a joint first-time homebuyer 34 savings account, and for any other person the account holder 35 -10- LSB 2608YH (5) 91 jm/jh 10/ 12 H.F. 659 is allowed to deduct for the first $2,000 of contributions 1 made to such an account during the tax year. The first-time 2 homebuyer savings account annual deduction limits are indexed 3 to inflation and are increased each year. For the 2024 tax 4 year the annual deduction limit for married persons filing a 5 joint return is $4,512, and for all other persons the limit is 6 $2,256. 7 The bill increases the annual deduction limit for first-time 8 homebuyer savings account contributions to $10,000 for married 9 persons filing a joint return, and to $5,000 for any other 10 account holder. The new annual deduction limits in the bill 11 are also indexed to inflation and are increased each year. 12 DIVISION III ââ NEIGHBORHOOD RENOVATION GRANT PROGRAM. 13 The bill establishes a neighborhood housing renovation 14 grant program (program) and fund (neighborhood fund) to 15 be administered by the authority for purposes of awarding 16 grants to eligible homeowners for qualifying exterior home 17 improvements, repairs, or renovations (exterior work). 18 There is appropriated to the authority for deposit in the 19 neighborhood fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025, 20 from the general fund of the state, the sum of $50 million. 21 Notwithstanding Code section 12C.7(2), interest or earnings on 22 moneys in the neighborhood fund shall accrue to the authority 23 and shall be used for purposes of the program. Notwithstanding 24 Code section 8.33, moneys in the neighborhood fund at the end 25 of each fiscal year shall not revert to any other fund but 26 shall remain in the neighborhood fund for expenditure for 27 subsequent fiscal years. All repayments or recaptures of the 28 grants awarded under the program shall accrue to the authority 29 and shall be used for purposes of the program. 30 The authority shall not use more than 3 percent of the moneys 31 in the neighborhood fund at the beginning of the fiscal year 32 for purposes of administrative costs, marketing, and other 33 program support. 34 To qualify for the program, a homeownerâs household income 35 -11- LSB 2608YH (5) 91 jm/jh 11/ 12 H.F. 659 shall not exceed $109,000 and the homeowner must occupy the 1 property at which the exterior work will occur.
