1 Section 1. Section 256.210, subsection 2, Code 2025, is
2 amended to read as follows:
3 2. a. Scholarship Subject to paragraph “b”, scholarship
4 awards paid pursuant to this section shall not exceed the
5 resident tuition rate established for institutions of higher
6 learning under the control of the state board of regents.
7 If the amount appropriated in a fiscal year for purposes of
8 this section is insufficient to provide scholarships to all
9 national guard members who apply for the program and who are
10 determined by the adjutant general to be eligible for the
11 program, the adjutant general shall, in coordination with
12 the commission, determine the distribution of scholarships.
13 However, scholarship awards paid pursuant to this section and
14 shall not be less than fifty percent of the resident tuition
15 rate established for institutions of higher learning under
16 the control of the state board of regents or fifty percent of
17 the tuition rate at the institution attended by the national
18 guard member, whichever is lower. Neither eligibility nor
19 scholarship award determinations shall be based upon a national
20 guard member’s unit, the location at which drills are attended,
21 or whether the eligible individual is a member of the Iowa army
22 or air national guard.
23 b. Scholarship awards paid pursuant to this section shall
24 not exceed the difference between the tuition rate at the
25 institution attended by the national guard member less any
26 financial aid the national guard member receives under 10
27 U.S.C. §2007.
28 c. If the amount appropriated in a fiscal year for purposes
29 of this section is insufficient to provide scholarships to
30 all national guard members who apply for the program and who
31 are determined by the adjutant general to be eligible for the
32 program, the adjutant general shall, in coordination with the
33 commission, determine the distribution of scholarships.

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
2 This bill modifies provisions related to the national guard
3 service scholarship program.
4 The national guard service scholarship program, administered
5 by the college student aid commission, provides annual
6 awards to Iowa national guard members who attend eligible
7 Iowa colleges and universities. Current law provides that
8 scholarship awards under the program shall not exceed the
9 resident tuition rate established for institutions of higher
10 learning under the control of the state board of regents. The
11 bill provides that the amount of the scholarship awards also
12 shall not exceed the difference between the tuition rate at
13 the institution attended by the national guard member less any
14 financial aid the national guard member receives under certain
15 specified federal programs.
16 Current law provides that, for purposes of the national
17 guard service scholarship program, neither eligibility nor
18 scholarship award determinations shall be based upon a national
19 guard member’s unit, the location at which drills are attended,
20 or whether the eligible individual is a member of the Iowa army
21 or air national guard. The bill strikes this provision.
