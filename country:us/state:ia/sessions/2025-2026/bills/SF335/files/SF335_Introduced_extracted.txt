The bill also 9 allows the parent or guardian of a student enrolled in the 10 school district, or an employee of the school district, who 11 alleges that an administrator knew of a violation of Code 12 section 279.74(2) by a contractor or teacher but failed to 13 stop such violation to bring a civil action for injunctive 14 relief against the school district. If a parent, guardian, or 15 employee is the prevailing party in that civil action, the bill 16 requires the court to award reasonable court costs and attorney 17 fees to the parent, guardian, or employee, and to assess a 18 $50,000 civil penalty against the school district. The bill 19 also requires the clerk of court to send a copy of the courtâs 20 order to the board of educational examiners (BOEE). The BOEE 21 is required to revoke the license of a teacher or administrator 22 who a court finds violated Code section 279.74(2). 23 The bill establishes another enforcement process if no 24 civil action has been instituted by the parent or guardian 25 of a student or an employee of the school district. This 26 enforcement process involves written warnings being issued to 27 the teacher or administrator by the department of education 28 (DE) and hearings conducted before the BOEE. If the parent, 29 guardian, or employee is not satisfied with the result of a 30 hearing conducted before the BOEE, the bill allows the parent, 31 guardian, or employee to report the teacher or administrator 32 to the state board of education or the attorney general for 33 investigation and further enforcement and to bring a civil 34 action for injunctive relief against the school district that 35 -11- LSB 1509XS (9) 91 jda/jh 11/ 14 S.F. 335 employs the teacher or administrator. The bill also allows the 1 parent, guardian, or employee to report potential violations to 2 the director of the department of education. 3 Current law prohibits school districts, charter schools, and 4 innovation zone schools from providing any program, curriculum, 5 test, survey, questionnaire, promotion, or instruction relating 6 to gender identity or sexual orientation to students in 7 kindergarten through grade six. The bill allows the parent or 8 guardian of a student enrolled in the school, or an employee of 9 the school, who alleges a violation of this prohibition by a 10 contractor or teacher to bring a civil action for injunctive 11 relief against the school to prohibit the contractor or teacher 12 from continuing such violation. The bill also allows the 13 parent or guardian of a student enrolled in the school, or an 14 employee of the school, who alleges that an administrator knew 15 of a violation of the prohibition by a contractor or teacher 16 but failed to stop such violation to bring a civil action for 17 injunctive relief against the school district. If a parent, 18 guardian, or employee is the prevailing party in that civil 19 action, the bill requires the court to award reasonable court 20 costs and attorney fees to the parent, guardian, or employee, 21 and to assess a $50,000 civil penalty against the school. The 22 bill also requires the clerk of court to send a copy of the 23 courtâs order to the BOEE. The BOEE is required to revoke 24 the license of a teacher or administrator who a court finds 25 violated this prohibition. 26 The bill establishes another enforcement process if no 27 civil action has been instituted by the parent or guardian 28 of a student or an employee of the school. This enforcement 29 process involves written warnings being issued to the teacher 30 or administrator by DE and hearings conducted before the BOEE. 31 If the parent, guardian, or employee is not satisfied with the 32 result of a hearing conducted before the BOEE, the bill allows 33 the parent, guardian, or employee to report the teacher or 34 administrator to the state board of education or the attorney 35 -12- LSB 1509XS (9) 91 jda/jh 12/ 14 S.F. 335 general for investigation and further enforcement and to bring 1 a civil action for injunctive relief against the school that 2 employs the teacher or administrator. The bill also allows the 3 parent, guardian, or employee to report potential violations to 4 the director of the department of education. 5 The bill prohibits school districts, charter schools, and 6 innovation zone schools from establishing, or expending moneys 7 to establish, sustain, support, or staff, a diversity, equity, 8 and inclusion office, and from hiring or assigning an employee 9 of the school, or contracting with a third party, to perform 10 the duties of a diversity, equity, or inclusion office. 11 The bill allows parents or guardians of a student enrolled in 12 the school, or an employee of the school, who alleges that an 13 administrator knew of a violation of the billâs prohibitions 14 but failed to stop such violation to bring a civil action for 15 injunctive relief against the school. If a parent, guardian, 16 or employee is the prevailing party in that civil action, the 17 bill requires the court to award reasonable court costs and 18 attorney fees to the parent, guardian, or employee, and to 19 assess a $50,000 civil penalty against the school. The bill 20 also requires the clerk of court to send a copy of the courtâs 21 order to the BOEE. The BOEE is required to revoke the license 22 of an administrator who a court finds knew of a violation of 23 the billâs prohibitions but failed to report such violation. 24 The bill establishes another enforcement process if no civil 25 action has been instituted by the parent or guardian of a 26 student or an employee of the school. This enforcement process 27 involves written warnings being issued to the administrator 28 by DE and hearings conducted before the BOEE. If the parent, 29 guardian, or employee is not satisfied with the result of a 30 hearing conducted before the BOEE, the bill allows the parent, 31 guardian, or employee to report the administrator to the state 32 board of education or the attorney general for investigation 33 and further enforcement and to bring a civil action for 34 injunctive relief against the school district that employs the 35 -13- LSB 1509XS (9) 91 jda/jh 13/ 14 S.F. 335 administrator. The bill also allows the parent, guardian, or 1 employee to report potential violations to the director of DE. 2 2024 Iowa Acts, chapter 1152, implemented prohibitions 3 related to the establishment of a diversity, equity, and 4 inclusion office at a public institution of higher education 5 governed by the board of regents and the hiring or education to 6 perform the duties of a diversity, equity, or inclusion office, 7 among other prohibitions. To enforce these prohibitions, 2024 8 Iowa Acts, chapter 1152, allowed any person to notify the 9 attorney general of a public institution of higher educationâs 10 potential violation. The attorney general may bring an action 11 against a public institution of higher education for a writ of 12 mandamus to compel the public institution of higher education 13 to comply. 14 The bill includes community colleges within the definition 15 of âpublic institution of higher educationâ in 2024 Iowa 16 Acts, chapter 1152, so that these restrictions also apply 17 to community colleges. In addition, the bill authorizes a 18 student enrolled in a public institution of higher education, 19 or an employee of a public institution of higher education, 20 who alleges that a public institution of higher education 21 violated the prohibitions in 2024 Iowa Acts, chapter 1152, 22 to bring a civil action for injunctive relief against the 23 public institution of higher education to prohibit the public 24 institution of higher education from continuing such violation. 25 If a student or employee is the prevailing party in the civil 26 action, the bill requires the court to award reasonable court 27 costs and attorney fees to the student or employee, and to 28 assess a $100,000 civil penalty against the public institution 29 of higher education. The bill also requires the public 30 institution of higher education to immediately terminate the 31 employment of any employee who is responsible for the public 32 institution of higher educationâs violation of the prohibitions 33 in 2024 Iowa Acts, chapter 1152. 34 -14- LSB 1509XS (9) 91 jda/jh 14/ 14

The bill also 9 allows the parent or guardian of a student enrolled in the 10 school district, or an employee of the school district, who 11 alleges that an administrator knew of a violation of Code 12 section 279.74(2) by a contractor or teacher but failed to 13 stop such violation to bring a civil action for injunctive 14 relief against the school district. If a parent, guardian, or 15 employee is the prevailing party in that civil action, the bill 16 requires the court to award reasonable court costs and attorney 17 fees to the parent, guardian, or employee, and to assess a 18 $50,000 civil penalty against the school district. The bill 19 also requires the clerk of court to send a copy of the courtâs 20 order to the board of educational examiners (BOEE). The BOEE 21 is required to revoke the license of a teacher or administrator 22 who a court finds violated Code section 279.74(2). 23 The bill establishes another enforcement process if no 24 civil action has been instituted by the parent or guardian 25 of a student or an employee of the school district. This 26 enforcement process involves written warnings being issued to 27 the teacher or administrator by the department of education 28 (DE) and hearings conducted before the BOEE. If the parent, 29 guardian, or employee is not satisfied with the result of a 30 hearing conducted before the BOEE, the bill allows the parent, 31 guardian, or employee to report the teacher or administrator 32 to the state board of education or the attorney general for 33 investigation and further enforcement and to bring a civil 34 action for injunctive relief against the school district that 35 -11- LSB 1509XS (9) 91 jda/jh 11/ 14 S.F. 335 employs the teacher or administrator. The bill also allows the 1 parent, guardian, or employee to report potential violations to 2 the director of the department of education. 3 Current law prohibits school districts, charter schools, and 4 innovation zone schools from providing any program, curriculum, 5 test, survey, questionnaire, promotion, or instruction relating 6 to gender identity or sexual orientation to students in 7 kindergarten through grade six. The bill allows the parent or 8 guardian of a student enrolled in the school, or an employee of 9 the school, who alleges a violation of this prohibition by a 10 contractor or teacher to bring a civil action for injunctive 11 relief against the school to prohibit the contractor or teacher 12 from continuing such violation. The bill also allows the 13 parent or guardian of a student enrolled in the school, or an 14 employee of the school, who alleges that an administrator knew 15 of a violation of the prohibition by a contractor or teacher 16 but failed to stop such violation to bring a civil action for 17 injunctive relief against the school district. If a parent, 18 guardian, or employee is the prevailing party in that civil 19 action, the bill requires the court to award reasonable court 20 costs and attorney fees to the parent, guardian, or employee, 21 and to assess a $50,000 civil penalty against the school. The 22 bill also requires the clerk of court to send a copy of the 23 courtâs order to the BOEE. The BOEE is required to revoke 24 the license of a teacher or administrator who a court finds 25 violated this prohibition. 26 The bill establishes another enforcement process if no 27 civil action has been instituted by the parent or guardian 28 of a student or an employee of the school. This enforcement 29 process involves written warnings being issued to the teacher 30 or administrator by DE and hearings conducted before the BOEE. 31 If the parent, guardian, or employee is not satisfied with the 32 result of a hearing conducted before the BOEE, the bill allows 33 the parent, guardian, or employee to report the teacher or 34 administrator to the state board of education or the attorney 35 -12- LSB 1509XS (9) 91 jda/jh 12/ 14 S.F. 335 general for investigation and further enforcement and to bring 1 a civil action for injunctive relief against the school that 2 employs the teacher or administrator. The bill also allows the 3 parent, guardian, or employee to report potential violations to 4 the director of the department of education. 5 The bill prohibits school districts, charter schools, and 6 innovation zone schools from establishing, or expending moneys 7 to establish, sustain, support, or staff, a diversity, equity, 8 and inclusion office, and from hiring or assigning an employee 9 of the school, or contracting with a third party, to perform 10 the duties of a diversity, equity, or inclusion office. 11 The bill allows parents or guardians of a student enrolled in 12 the school, or an employee of the school, who alleges that an 13 administrator knew of a violation of the billâs prohibitions 14 but failed to stop such violation to bring a civil action for 15 injunctive relief against the school. If a parent, guardian, 16 or employee is the prevailing party in that civil action, the 17 bill requires the court to award reasonable court costs and 18 attorney fees to the parent, guardian, or employee, and to 19 assess a $50,000 civil penalty against the school. The bill 20 also requires the clerk of court to send a copy of the courtâs 21 order to the BOEE. The BOEE is required to revoke the license 22 of an administrator who a court finds knew of a violation of 23 the billâs prohibitions but failed to report such violation. 24 The bill establishes another enforcement process if no civil 25 action has been instituted by the parent or guardian of a 26 student or an employee of the school. This enforcement process 27 involves written warnings being issued to the administrator 28 by DE and hearings conducted before the BOEE. If the parent, 29 guardian, or employee is not satisfied with the result of a 30 hearing conducted before the BOEE, the bill allows the parent, 31 guardian, or employee to report the administrator to the state 32 board of education or the attorney general for investigation 33 and further enforcement and to bring a civil action for 34 injunctive relief against the school district that employs the 35 -13- LSB 1509XS (9) 91 jda/jh 13/ 14 S.F. 335 administrator. The bill also allows the parent, guardian, or 1 employee to report potential violations to the director of DE. 2 2024 Iowa Acts, chapter 1152, implemented prohibitions 3 related to the establishment of a diversity, equity, and 4 inclusion office at a public institution of higher education 5 governed by the board of regents and the hiring or education to 6 perform the duties of a diversity, equity, or inclusion office, 7 among other prohibitions. To enforce these prohibitions, 2024 8 Iowa Acts, chapter 1152, allowed any person to notify the 9 attorney general of a public institution of higher educationâs 10 potential violation. The attorney general may bring an action 11 against a public institution of higher education for a writ of 12 mandamus to compel the public institution of higher education 13 to comply. 14 The bill includes community colleges within the definition 15 of âpublic institution of higher educationâ in 2024 Iowa 16 Acts, chapter 1152, so that these restrictions also apply 17 to community colleges. In addition, the bill authorizes a 18 student enrolled in a public institution of higher education, 19 or an employee of a public institution of higher education, 20 who alleges that a public institution of higher education 21 violated the prohibitions in 2024 Iowa Acts, chapter 1152, 22 to bring a civil action for injunctive relief against the 23 public institution of higher education to prohibit the public 24 institution of higher education from continuing such violation. 25 If a student or employee is the prevailing party in the civil 26 action, the bill requires the court to award reasonable court 27 costs and attorney fees to the student or employee, and to 28 assess a $100,000 civil penalty against the public institution 29 of higher education. The bill also requires the public 30 institution of higher education to immediately terminate the 31 employment of any employee who is responsible for the public 32 institution of higher educationâs violation of the prohibitions 33 in 2024 Iowa Acts, chapter 1152. 34 -14- LSB 1509XS (9) 91 jda/jh 14/ 14
