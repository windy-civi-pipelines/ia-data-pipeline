13 EXPLANATION
14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
15 the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
16 This bill relates to matters under the purview of the
17 department of insurance and financial services including
18 financial literacy and exploitation, tax confidentiality,
19 health insurance rates, health savings accounts, insurer
20 withdrawals, property insurance, and service contracts.
21 DIVISION I —— FINANCIAL LITERACY AND FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION.
22 Division I appropriates $10 of each fee collected from the
23 filing of an application as an agent of a real estate broker or
24 dealer to the financial literacy and investor education fund
25 (education fund), and to the financial exploitation prevention
26 fund (prevention fund), both of which are created in the bill.
27 Initiatives by the commissioner of insurance (commissioner)
28 involving financial literacy and investor education shall
29 comply with the requirements of the bill.
30 Under the bill, nonexamination revenues payable to the
31 insurance division (division) or the department of revenue
32 (DOR) in connection with the regulation of insurance companies
33 shall be deposited in the commerce revolving fund, rather than
34 40 percent as is required under current law. The director of
35 the department of insurance and financial services (director)
LSB 1437XD (15) 91
-33- nls/ko 33/40
S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 shall be responsible for identifying and coordinating
2 appropriate opportunities for collaboration on financial
3 literacy and exploitation with the chief administrative
4 officers (CAO) of each division and each CAO’s respective
5 regulated entities.
6 The bill creates the education fund under the control of the
7 director. The director shall develop and implement financial
8 literacy and investor education initiatives for the public
9 by providing education on financial topics, including topics
10 required to be offered and taught for grades 9 through 12. The
11 education fund consists of moneys as detailed in the bill.
12 Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, moneys in
13 the education fund may be moved to the prevention fund at the
14 discretion of the director.
15 The bill creates the prevention fund, under which the
16 director shall develop and implement initiatives to educate
17 the public on financial exploitation; assist individuals
18 who are known, suspected, or potential victims of financial
19 exploitation; and to conduct investigations, refer
20 investigations to other law enforcement, and assist in the
21 prosecution of persons involved in financial exploitation. The
22 prevention fund consists of moneys as detailed in the bill.
23 All investigation files, investigation reports, and all
24 other investigative information in the possession of the
25 department of insurance and financial services (department)
26 shall be confidential and shall not be subject to release by
27 discovery, subpoena, or other means of legal compulsion until
28 opened for public inspection by the department, or upon the
29 consent of the department, or until a court determines the
30 department will not be unnecessarily hindered if opened for
31 public inspection. Investigative information in the possession
32 of the department may be disclosed, shared, or received in
33 the circumstances detailed in the bill. An investigator or
34 staff member of the department shall not be subject to subpoena
35 concerning any pending or continuing investigation conducted
LSB 1437XD (15) 91

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 by the department.
2 On the effective date of division I of the bill, all
3 unencumbered and unobligated moneys remaining in the securities
4 investor education and financial literacy training fund in Code
5 section 502.601 shall be transferred to the education fund.
6 DIVISION II —— TAX ON GROSS PREMIUMS —— CONFIDENTIALITY.
7 Under division II, a tax return filed under Code section
8 432.1 (tax on gross premiums —— exclusions) or 432.1A (tax on
9 premiums —— captive companies) shall not be open to inspection.
10 It shall be unlawful for any present or former officer or
11 employee of the state to willfully or recklessly publish any
12 such tax return. A person who does so is guilty of a serious
13 misdemeanor and, in addition to any other penalty, shall be
14 dismissed from office or discharged from employment. A serious
15 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
16 year and a fine of at least $430 but no more than $2,560. The
17 bill does not prohibit the DOR from turning over information
18 and tax returns in the DOR’s possession to duly authorized
19 officers of the United States or tax officials of other states
20 pursuant to an agreement.
21 DIVISION III —— HEALTH INSURANCE RATE INCREASES —— PUBLIC
22 HEARINGS. Division III permits the commissioner to hold a
23 public hearing at the time a carrier files for proposed health
24 insurance rate increases exceeding the average annual health
25 spending growth rate, rather than requiring the commissioner to
26 hold such public hearing as is the case under current law.
27 DIVISION IV —— HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS AND QUALIFIED
28 HIGH-DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH PLANS —— COST-SHARING. Under division
29 IV, if a copayment, coinsurance, or deductible paid as
30 cost-sharing by an enrollee in an individual or group accident
31 or health insurance plan would result in the enrollee becoming
32 ineligible for a health savings account associated with the
33 enrollee’s qualified high-deductible health plan (HDHP), the
34 cost-sharing shall apply only to the enrollee’s qualified HDHP
35 after the enrollee satisfies the enrollee’s minimum deductible,

-35- nls/ko 35/40
S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 except for items or services determined to be preventive.
2 DIVISION V —— INSURANCE COMPANY WITHDRAWAL REQUIREMENTS.
3 Division V requires an insurer, prior to withdrawing, to
4 file a withdrawal plan (plan) with the commissioner if the
5 insurer intends to reduce the insurer’s total annual premium
6 volume in the state by 50 percent or more, intends to reduce
7 the insurer’s total annual premium in the state in a line of
8 insurance by 75 percent or more, or intends to reduce the
9 insurer’s total annual premium volume in the state in a line of
10 private passenger automobile insurance, homeowners insurance,
11 or dwelling property insurance by 50 percent or more.
12 Withdrawal requirements do not apply to a transfer of business
13 from one insurer to another insurer that are both within the
14 same insurance holding company system if the insurer to whom
15 the business is being transferred is authorized to engage in
16 the business of insurance in the state, and the business is
17 not a reciprocal or interinsurance exchange, a lloyd’s plan,
18 or a state or county mutual insurance association. “Insurer”
19 is defined in the bill.
20 If the plan meets all of the requirements as described in
21 the bill, the commissioner shall approve the plan. If the
22 commissioner finds that a plan does not meet all requirements,
23 the commissioner may modify, restrict, limit, or deny the
24 withdrawal plan. An insurer may request a hearing on the
25 commissioner’s decision as described in the bill.
26 An insurer that withdraws from writing all lines of
27 insurance in the state shall not, without prior approval
28 of the commissioner, resume writing insurance in the state
29 for a minimum of five years. A violation of the withdrawal
30 requirements constitutes an unfair method of competition and
31 unfair or deceptive act or practice. The commissioner may
32 adopt rules to administer and enforce division V.
33 DIVISION VI —— REPLACEMENT COST, ACTUAL CASH VALUE, AND
34 LINE OF SIGHT. Division VI requires for an insurance policy
35 providing for the adjustment and settlement of first-party

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 losses based on replacement cost when a loss requires repair or
2 replacement of a product or part, consequential physical damage
3 shall be included in the calculation of loss, and the insured
4 shall not be required to pay for betterment or other costs,
5 except for any deductible. When a loss requires replacement of
6 a damaged product and the product is available for purchase,
7 the identical product shall be used, or if it is not available,
8 the insurer shall use a reasonably similar product.
9 For a policy providing for adjustment and settlement of
10 first-party losses based on actual cash value (ACV), for
11 residential fire and extended coverage, the insurer shall
12 determine the ACV and shall provide a copy of the claim file
13 worksheet.
14 For an insurance policy providing for the adjustment and
15 settlement of first-party losses based on ACV, where the
16 insured’s interest is limited because damaged property has
17 nominal or no economic value, or a value disproportionate to
18 replacement cost less depreciation, a determination of ACV
19 shall not be required.
20 DIVISION VII —— SERVICE COMPANIES, SERVICE CONTRACTS,
21 AND LICENSES. Division VII prohibits a person who shall be
22 contractually obligated to a service contract holder under the
23 terms of a service contract from issuing, offering for sale, or
24 selling a motor vehicle service contract or residential service
25 contract in the state unless the person is a licensed service
26 company. The requirements of the bill do not apply to any
27 person who provides support services.
28 A service company shall maintain a license for the entirety
29 of any service contract that the service company has entered.
30 A service company shall report to the commissioner within 30
31 calendar days any material change to the information submitted
32 in the initial or renewal application.
33 An application for a license as a service company shall
34 be filed with the commissioner and include all required
35 information as described in the bill, and be accompanied

1 by a $500 license fee and a $35 fee for each motor vehicle
2 service contract form provided by the service company in the
3 application. A license shall be valid for one year and shall
4 be renewed on or before the date the license expires.
5 An application for license renewal shall include the
6 information required for an initial license, a list of
7 each service contract form, and the information and fees as
8 described in the bill. If the renewal application meets the
9 requirements, and the commissioner has not refused to renew
10 the license, the commissioner shall renew the license. If the
11 commissioner denies renewal, the denial shall be in writing.
12 If a service company fails to renew their license on or
13 before the final day of the license period, the company’s
14 license shall be deemed expired. Prior to a license expiration
15 date, and if a renewal application was submitted at least 14
16 days prior to the license expiration date, the commissioner may
17 extend the renewal period an additional 30 calendar days. If a
18 service company submits an application or renewal application
19 after the license has expired, the service company shall pay a
20 $800 reinstatement fee and shall file a service company license
21 renewal application, including payment of applicable fees, with
22 the division. Restrictions on a service company whose license
23 term has expired are detailed in the bill.
24 A service contract shall not be issued, sold, or offered
25 for sale unless the service company provides a receipt for
26 the purchase of the service contract to the service contract
27 holder (holder), provides a complete sample copy of the service
28 contract prior to purchase, and provides a completed paper or
29 electronic copy of the service contract to the holder within
30 10 calendar days of purchase. A paper copy of the sample copy
31 of the service contract, or the service contract, shall be
32 provided upon the request of the consumer at the expense of the
33 service company.
34 A service contract issued, sold, or offered for sale in
35 the state shall comply with all of the requirements described

5 A service company shall file with the division an accurate
6 copy of each service contract form prior to using the service
7 contract form and, at the time of filing shall pay a $35 fee for
8 each motor vehicle service contract form. A service company
9 may continue to use a noncompliant service contract form until
10 June 30, 2026, provided no changes are made to the form, and
11 the service contract form was filed with the division in 2024.
12 The commissioner may suspend or revoke the license of, deny
13 an application for license from, or refuse to renew the license
14 of, a service company, or may levy a civil penalty against a
15 service company, for any of the reasons described in the bill.
16 The commissioner shall notify the service company in writing
17 of the reason for the suspension, revocation, nonrenewal, or
18 denial. The licensee or applicant may request a hearing.

23 associated with doing business in the state in the immediately
24 preceding fiscal year.
25 A service company that offers service contracts for sale,
26 or the service company’s support services, shall not represent
27 in any manner a false, deceptive, or misleading statement with
28 respect to the service company’s affiliation with a motor
29 vehicle manufacturer or importer, the validity or expiration of
30 a warranty, a motor vehicle service contract holder’s coverage
31 under a motor vehicle service contract, or describing the
32 service contract as a policy.
33 A service company shall not engage in a prohibited act or

13 EXPLANATION
14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
15 the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
16 This bill relates to matters under the purview of the
17 department of insurance and financial services including
18 financial literacy and exploitation, tax confidentiality,
19 health insurance rates, health savings accounts, insurer
20 withdrawals, property insurance, and service contracts.
21 DIVISION I —— FINANCIAL LITERACY AND FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION.
22 Division I appropriates $10 of each fee collected from the
23 filing of an application as an agent of a real estate broker or
24 dealer to the financial literacy and investor education fund
25 (education fund), and to the financial exploitation prevention
26 fund (prevention fund), both of which are created in the bill.
27 Initiatives by the commissioner of insurance (commissioner)
28 involving financial literacy and investor education shall
29 comply with the requirements of the bill.
30 Under the bill, nonexamination revenues payable to the
31 insurance division (division) or the department of revenue
32 (DOR) in connection with the regulation of insurance companies
33 shall be deposited in the commerce revolving fund, rather than
34 40 percent as is required under current law. The director of
35 the department of insurance and financial services (director)

1 shall be responsible for identifying and coordinating
2 appropriate opportunities for collaboration on financial
3 literacy and exploitation with the chief administrative
4 officers (CAO) of each division and each CAO’s respective
5 regulated entities.
6 The bill creates the education fund under the control of the
7 director. The director shall develop and implement financial
8 literacy and investor education initiatives for the public
9 by providing education on financial topics, including topics
10 required to be offered and taught for grades 9 through 12. The
11 education fund consists of moneys as detailed in the bill.
12 Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, moneys in
13 the education fund may be moved to the prevention fund at the
14 discretion of the director.
15 The bill creates the prevention fund, under which the
16 director shall develop and implement initiatives to educate
17 the public on financial exploitation; assist individuals
18 who are known, suspected, or potential victims of financial
19 exploitation; and to conduct investigations, refer
20 investigations to other law enforcement, and assist in the
21 prosecution of persons involved in financial exploitation. The
22 prevention fund consists of moneys as detailed in the bill.
23 All investigation files, investigation reports, and all
24 other investigative information in the possession of the
25 department of insurance and financial services (department)
26 shall be confidential and shall not be subject to release by
27 discovery, subpoena, or other means of legal compulsion until
28 opened for public inspection by the department, or upon the
29 consent of the department, or until a court determines the
30 department will not be unnecessarily hindered if opened for
31 public inspection. Investigative information in the possession
32 of the department may be disclosed, shared, or received in
33 the circumstances detailed in the bill. An investigator or

2 On the effective date of division I of the bill, all
3 unencumbered and unobligated moneys remaining in the securities
4 investor education and financial literacy training fund in Code
5 section 502.601 shall be transferred to the education fund.
6 DIVISION II —— TAX ON GROSS PREMIUMS —— CONFIDENTIALITY.
7 Under division II, a tax return filed under Code section
8 432.1 (tax on gross premiums —— exclusions) or 432.1A (tax on
9 premiums —— captive companies) shall not be open to inspection.
10 It shall be unlawful for any present or former officer or
11 employee of the state to willfully or recklessly publish any
12 such tax return. A person who does so is guilty of a serious
13 misdemeanor and, in addition to any other penalty, shall be
14 dismissed from office or discharged from employment. A serious
15 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
16 year and a fine of at least $430 but no more than $2,560. The
17 bill does not prohibit the DOR from turning over information
18 and tax returns in the DOR’s possession to duly authorized
19 officers of the United States or tax officials of other states
20 pursuant to an agreement.
21 DIVISION III —— HEALTH INSURANCE RATE INCREASES —— PUBLIC
22 HEARINGS. Division III permits the commissioner to hold a
23 public hearing at the time a carrier files for proposed health
24 insurance rate increases exceeding the average annual health
25 spending growth rate, rather than requiring the commissioner to
26 hold such public hearing as is the case under current law.
27 DIVISION IV —— HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS AND QUALIFIED
28 HIGH-DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH PLANS —— COST-SHARING. Under division
29 IV, if a copayment, coinsurance, or deductible paid as
30 cost-sharing by an enrollee in an individual or group accident
31 or health insurance plan would result in the enrollee becoming
32 ineligible for a health savings account associated with the
33 enrollee’s qualified high-deductible health plan (HDHP), the
34 cost-sharing shall apply only to the enrollee’s qualified HDHP
35 after the enrollee satisfies the enrollee’s minimum deductible,

1 except for items or services determined to be preventive.
2 DIVISION V —— INSURANCE COMPANY WITHDRAWAL REQUIREMENTS.
3 Division V requires an insurer, prior to withdrawing, to
4 file a withdrawal plan (plan) with the commissioner if the
5 insurer intends to reduce the insurer’s total annual premium
6 volume in the state by 50 percent or more, intends to reduce
7 the insurer’s total annual premium in the state in a line of
8 insurance by 75 percent or more, or intends to reduce the
9 insurer’s total annual premium volume in the state in a line of
10 private passenger automobile insurance, homeowners insurance,
11 or dwelling property insurance by 50 percent or more.
12 Withdrawal requirements do not apply to a transfer of business
13 from one insurer to another insurer that are both within the
14 same insurance holding company system if the insurer to whom
15 the business is being transferred is authorized to engage in
16 the business of insurance in the state, and the business is
17 not a reciprocal or interinsurance exchange, a lloyd’s plan,
18 or a state or county mutual insurance association. “Insurer”
19 is defined in the bill.
20 If the plan meets all of the requirements as described in
21 the bill, the commissioner shall approve the plan. If the
22 commissioner finds that a plan does not meet all requirements,
23 the commissioner may modify, restrict, limit, or deny the
24 withdrawal plan. An insurer may request a hearing on the
25 commissioner’s decision as described in the bill.
26 An insurer that withdraws from writing all lines of
27 insurance in the state shall not, without prior approval
28 of the commissioner, resume writing insurance in the state
29 for a minimum of five years. A violation of the withdrawal
30 requirements constitutes an unfair method of competition and

11 commissioner denies renewal, the denial shall be in writing.
12 If a service company fails to renew their license on or
13 before the final day of the license period, the company’s
14 license shall be deemed expired. Prior to a license expiration
15 date, and if a renewal application was submitted at least 14
16 days prior to the license expiration date, the commissioner may
17 extend the renewal period an additional 30 calendar days. If a
18 service company submits an application or renewal application

27 holder (holder), provides a complete sample copy of the service
28 contract prior to purchase, and provides a completed paper or
29 electronic copy of the service contract to the holder within

7 contract form and, at the time of filing shall pay a $35 fee for
8 each motor vehicle service contract form. A service company
9 may continue to use a noncompliant service contract form until
10 June 30, 2026, provided no changes are made to the form, and
11 the service contract form was filed with the division in 2024.
12 The commissioner may suspend or revoke the license of, deny
13 an application for license from, or refuse to renew the license
14 of, a service company, or may levy a civil penalty against a
15 service company, for any of the reasons described in the bill.

22 exceed 10 percent of the service company’s reported net income
23 associated with doing business in the state in the immediately
24 preceding fiscal year.
25 A service company that offers service contracts for sale,
26 or the service company’s support services, shall not represent
27 in any manner a false, deceptive, or misleading statement with
28 respect to the service company’s affiliation with a motor
29 vehicle manufacturer or importer, the validity or expiration of
30 a warranty, a motor vehicle service contract holder’s coverage
31 under a motor vehicle service contract, or describing the
32 service contract as a policy.
33 A service company shall not engage in a prohibited act or
34 practice as detailed in the bill. The commissioner may adopt

23 identifiable information nor service company identifiable
24 information is made available.
