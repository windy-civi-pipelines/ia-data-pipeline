The federal 11 exemption must authorize any vehicle that is not prohibited 12 from being operated on the segment prior to the date of 13 designation as an interstate road to continue to be operated on 14 the segment after designation as an interstate road. 15 Sec. 2.

The department may authorize 31 an implement of husbandry to be operated on a segment of the 32 highway described above farther west beyond the intersection 33 with United States highway 69. This subparagraph is repealed 34 on the date an alternative route for implements of husbandry is 35 -1- LSB 1322HV (2) 91 th/ns 1/ 3 H.F. 1025 developed, deemed suitable by the department of transportation 1 in consultation with the department of agriculture and land 2 stewardship, and opened for traffic to bypass the segment of 3 the interstate road system described in this subparagraph.

The department of 7 transportation shall collaborate with the Des Moines area 8 metropolitan planning organization as the organization conducts 9 an alternative highway study to develop and implement an 10 accessible highway route suitable for implements of husbandry 11 to be operated alongside, but not directly on, the segment of 12 United States highway 65, and state highway 5, including where 13 the highway designations overlap, between United States highway 14 6 and United States highway 69. 15 Sec. 4. APPLICABILITY. This Act applies to the segment 16 of the highway known as United States highway 65, and state 17 highway 5, including where the highway designations overlap, 18 described in this Act on the effective date of this Act, 19 and shall apply to that segment of the highway thereafter 20 regardless of whether the highwayâs designation as United 21 States highway 65, or state highway 5, including where the 22 highway designations overlap, is subsequently changed by the 23 state transportation commission, department of transportation, 24 or the government of the United States. 25 EXPLANATION 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 27 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 28 Under current law, any kind of vehicle, implement, or 29 conveyance incapable of attaining and maintaining a speed of 40 30 miles per hour (MPH) is prohibited from using the interstate 31 road system. 32 This bill provides a conditional exception to that 33 prohibition. If an implement of husbandry may be operated 34 on the segment of the highway known as U.S. highway 65, and 35 -2- LSB 1322HV (2) 91 th/ns 2/ 3 H.F. 1025 state highway 5, including where the highway designations 1 overlap (segment), between the highwayâs intersection with U.S. 2 highway 6 and the highwayâs intersection with U.S. highway 69, 3 prior to the date the segment becomes part of the interstate 4 road system, then the implement of husbandry may continue to 5 be operated on that segment until an alternative route for 6 implements of husbandry is made available. The department of 7 transportation (DOT) may authorize an implement of husbandry to 8 be operated on the segment farther west beyond the intersection 9 with U.S. highway 69. 10 Under current law, an âimplement of husbandryâ means a 11 vehicle or special mobile equipment manufactured, designed, 12 or reconstructed for agricultural purposes and, except 13 for incidental uses, is exclusively used in the conduct of 14 agricultural operations. To be considered an implement of 15 husbandry, a self-propelled qualifying vehicle must be operated 16 at speeds of 35 MPH or less. 17 The bill prohibits the DOT and the state transportation 18 commission from pursuing an interstate road designation for 19 the segment extending between the segmentâs intersections with 20 interstate 35 and interstate 80 unless the U.S. government 21 provides an exemption from federal regulations regarding 22 vehicle weight and size on that segment, as described in the 23 bill. 24 The bill requires the DOT to collaborate with the Des Moines 25 area metropolitan planning organization as the organization 26 conducts an alternative highway study to develop and implement 27 an accessible alternative highway route suitable for implements 28 of husbandry. 29 The bill applies to the segment on the effective date of the 30 bill, and will continue to apply to the segment regardless of 31 whether the highwayâs designation is subsequently changed. 32 -3- LSB 1322HV (2) 91 th/ns 3/ 3
