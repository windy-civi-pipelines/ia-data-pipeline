House File 1025
AN ACT
RELATING TO CERTAIN STATE HIGHWAYS NOT DESIGNATED AS PART OF
THE INTERSTATE ROAD SYSTEM, INCLUDING THE OPERATION OF
IMPLEMENTS OF HUSBANDRY ON SUCH HIGHWAYS, AND INCLUDING
APPLICABILITY PROVISIONS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF IOWA:

Section 2:
Section 1. NEW SECTION. 314.16A Interstate road designation
— prohibition.
The department of transportation and the state
transportation commission shall not pursue an interstate
road designation for the segment of highway that is a
controlled-access facility, as defined in section 306A.2,
designated as state highway 5 and United States highway 65,
including where the highway designations overlap, between
interstate 35 and interstate 80, unless the United States
government provides an exemption to federal regulations
regarding vehicle weight and size on that segment. The federal
exemption must authorize any vehicle that is not prohibited
from being operated on the segment prior to the date of
designation as an interstate road to continue to be operated on
the segment after designation as an interstate road.
House File 1025, p. 2
Sec. 2. Section 321.285, subsection 5, paragraph e, Code
2025, is amended to read as follows:
e. (1) Any kind of A vehicle, device, implement, or
conveyance incapable of attaining and maintaining a speed
of forty miles per hour shall be prohibited from using the
interstate road system.
(2) This paragraph does not apply to an implement of
husbandry that a person is authorized to operate on the segment
of United States highway 65, and state highway 5, including
where the highway designations overlap, between the highway's
intersection with United States highway 6 and the highway's
intersection with United States highway 69, or farther west
if authorized by the department, prior to the date that
segment of highway is designated a part of the interstate
road system, if the segment of highway is designated a part
of the interstate road system. The department may authorize
an implement of husbandry to be operated on a segment of the
highway described above farther west beyond the intersection
with United States highway 69. This subparagraph is repealed
on the date an alternative route for implements of husbandry is
developed, deemed suitable by the department of transportation
in consultation with the department of agriculture and land
stewardship, and opened for traffic to bypass the segment of
the interstate road system described in this subparagraph. The
department of transportation shall notify the Iowa Code editor
on that date.
Sec. 3. ALTERNATIVE HIGHWAY STUDY. The department of
transportation shall collaborate with the Des Moines area
metropolitan planning organization as the organization conducts
an alternative highway study to develop and implement an
accessible highway route suitable for implements of husbandry
to be operated alongside, but not directly on, the segment of
United States highway 65, and state highway 5, including where
the highway designations overlap, between United States highway
6 and United States highway 69.
Sec. 4. APPLICABILITY. This Act applies to the segment
of the highway known as United States highway 65, and state
highway 5, including where the highway designations overlap,
described in this Act on the effective date of this Act,
House File 1025, p. 3
and shall apply to that segment of the highway thereafter
regardless of whether the highway's designation as United
States highway 65, or state highway 5, including where the
highway designations overlap, is subsequently changed by the
state transportation commission, department of transportation,
or the government of the United States.
