For purposes of this section: 7 a. âDisasterâ means any catastrophic event, regardless of 8 size, resulting from the release or failure of a liquefied 9 carbon dioxide pipeline, transportation, or storage system, 10 including but not limited to a leakage, rupture, or other 11 hazardous incident. 12 b. âFundâ means the Iowa carbon dioxide disaster relief fund 13 created in subsection 3. 14 c. âVictimâ means an individual, family, or community that 15 suffers loss, injury, or property damage as a result of carbon 16 dioxide release. 17 3. a. The Iowa carbon dioxide disaster relief fund 18 is created within the state treasury under control of the 19 department of natural resources. The fund shall consist of 20 moneys appropriated to or deposited in the fund, including 21 moneys deposited pursuant to subsection 4, and donations and 22 gifts to the fund obtained from any source.

An excise tax shall be paid by owners of liquefied 34 carbon dioxide pipelines or carbon dioxide facilities and by 35 -1- LSB 1979XS (7) 91 sb/js 1/ 6 S.F. 299 persons supplying carbon dioxide to a liquefied carbon dioxide 1 pipeline or carbon dioxide facility at a rate determined by the 2 general assembly, which may be adjusted pursuant to subsection 3 7. The excise tax shall be administered by the department of 4 revenue and shall be levied on the following: 5 (1) The total transportation capacity of liquefied carbon 6 dioxide pipelines and storage systems operating within Iowa, 7 calculated based on the volume of liquefied carbon dioxide that 8 could potentially be transported through the pipeline system 9 annually. 10 (2) The actual amount of liquefied carbon dioxide 11 transported through Iowa annually, calculated on the volume of 12 liquefied carbon dioxide that is moved through pipelines within 13 and through the state. 14 b. Section 422.25, subsection 4, sections 422.30, 422.67, 15 and 422.68, section 422.69, subsection 1, sections 422.70, 16 422.71, 422.72, 422.74, and 422.75, section 423.14, subsection 17 1, and sections 423.23, 423.24, 423.25, 423.31 through 18 423.35, 423.37 through 423.42, and 423.47, consistent with the 19 provisions of this section, shall apply with respect to the tax 20 authorized under this subsection, in the same manner and with 21 the same effect as if the excise taxes on the transportation 22 capacity or actual transportation of liquefied carbon dioxide 23 were retail sales taxes within the meaning of those statutes. 24 Notwithstanding this paragraph, the director shall provide for 25 monthly filing of returns and for other than monthly filing 26 of returns both as prescribed in section 423.31.
