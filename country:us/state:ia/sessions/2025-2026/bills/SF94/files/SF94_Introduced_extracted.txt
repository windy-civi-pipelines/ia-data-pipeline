A statewide voter registration database verification 13 pilot program is established within the office of the state 14 registrar as follows: 15 a.

The state registrar shall evaluate the efficacy and 28 cost of the pilot program as compared to the current method 29 of verifying the list of voters in the statewide voter 30 registration file. 31 2. This section is repealed December 31, 2028. 32 DIVISION VII 33 COUNTY HOSPITAL BOARD OF TRUSTEES 34 Sec. 38. Section 347.9, subsection 3, Code 2025, is amended 35 -15- LSB 1667XS (2) 91 ss/ns 15/ 19 S.F. 94 by striking the subsection. 1 Sec. 39. TRANSITION. This division of this Act does not 2 alter the term of office of a trustee elected to a county 3 public hospital board of trustees prior to the effective date 4 of this division of this Act. 5 EXPLANATION 6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 7 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 8 This bill relates to duties of the secretary of state, 9 including the address confidentiality program and the conduct 10 of elections. The bill is organized in divisions. 11 DIVISION I ââ ADDRESS CONFIDENTIALITY PROGRAM. This 12 division relates to the address confidentiality program, which 13 provides mail forwarding services to persons who are victims of 14 domestic abuse, domestic abuse assault, sexual abuse, assault, 15 stalking, or human trafficking, or who fear for their own 16 safety or the safety of a household member. The bill allows 17 the secretary of state to accept as a program participantâs 18 mailing address the name and other contact information of 19 a shelter in lieu of the shelterâs physical address, to 20 cancel a deceased participantâs certification, and to hold a 21 participantâs mail for up to 30 days at the request of the 22 participant. 23 DIVISION II ââ CANDIDATE ELIGIBILITY OBJECTIONS. This 24 division relates to the nomination of candidates for federal 25 office. The bill exempts candidates for federal office from 26 the requirement that a candidate sign a statement that the 27 candidate is aware that the candidate is disqualified from 28 holding office if the candidate has been convicted of a felony 29 or other infamous crime and the candidateâs rights have not 30 been restored by the governor or by the president of the United 31 States. The bill limits objections to the eligibility of a 32 candidate for a federal office that may be filed with the 33 state commissioner of elections to objections to the legal 34 sufficiency of the nomination petition or certificate of 35 -16- LSB 1667XS (2) 91 ss/ns 16/ 19 S.F. 94 election, or to the residency, age, or citizenship requirements 1 as described in the United States Constitution. With 2 respect to nominations for president or vice president of the 3 United States, the bill allows objections only to the legal 4 sufficiency of the certificate of nomination. The certificate 5 of nomination shall be presumed valid. 6 DIVISION III ââ RANKED CHOICE VOTING. This division relates 7 to the use of ranked choice and instant runoff voting for 8 elections in this state. The bill prohibits ranked choice and 9 instant runoff voting, defined in the bill as a system in which 10 voters rank multiple candidates for a single office in order of 11 preference and candidates are eliminated and votes transferred 12 between candidates in a series of rounds, from being used to 13 cast or tabulate ballots in any election in this state. 14 DIVISION IV ââ ABSENT VOTERS. This division relates to 15 the casting of ballots by absent voters. The bill strikes 16 provisions allowing a county commissioner of elections to 17 establish drop boxes to which a person can return an absentee 18 ballot. 19 The bill requires an absentee ballot that is mailed to a 20 voter to be enclosed in an unsealed affidavit envelope and with 21 or in an unsealed return envelope, which shall then be enclosed 22 in the delivery envelope. If the ballot cannot be folded so 23 that all the votes on the ballot will be hidden, the bill 24 requires the commissioner to also send a secrecy envelope. The 25 bill requires a registered voter to subscribe to an affidavit 26 on an affidavit envelope by signing the envelope and writing 27 the voterâs voter verification number. The bill also requires 28 return envelopes to have printed on them the deadline to return 29 the ballot and the manner to track the status of the ballot. 30 The bill strikes a requirement that an affidavit envelope 31 be considered to contain a defect if it appears to the county 32 commissioner of elections that it was signed by a person other 33 than the voter. The bill adds a requirement that an affidavit 34 envelope be considered to contain a defect if the voter 35 -17- LSB 1667XS (2) 91 ss/ns 17/ 19 S.F. 94 verification number on the envelope does not match the voter 1 verification number on file for the voter. 2 The bill repeals certain requirements regarding what 3 materials a commissioner shall include with an absentee ballot 4 and instead requires a commissioner to put the same serial 5 number on the affidavit, return, and delivery envelopes. 6 The bill requires all mailed absentee ballots to include an 7 affidavit envelope. The bill also requires the absentee and 8 special voters precinct board to reject an absentee ballot 9 if the affidavit envelope does not include the voterâs voter 10 verification number. 11 The bill changes the timeline for the mailing and return 12 of absentee ballots. The bill allows a county commissioner 13 of elections to mail absentee ballots to voters beginning 22 14 days before an election and requires absentee ballots to be 15 delivered to the office of the county commissioner of elections 16 by 5:00 p.m. on the day before election day. The bill also 17 requires the county commissioner of elections to record 18 the ballot as received by 11:59 p.m. on the day before the 19 election. Under current law, county commissioners of elections 20 may mail absentee ballots beginning 20 days before an election 21 and absentee ballots must be delivered to the office of the 22 county commissioner of elections not later than the time polls 23 close on election day. 24 DIVISION V ââ PERSONS PERMITTED IN VOTING BOOTHS. This 25 division amends the subsection of Code section 49.88 26 (limitation on persons in booth and time for voting) 27 prohibiting a person standing for election on the ballot before 28 a voter from occupying the voting booth with the voter and 29 Code section 49.90 (assisting voter) to say that the candidate 30 violates Code section 49.88 by occupying the voting booth with 31 the voter. 32 DIVISION VI ââ VOTER REGISTRATION DATABASE PILOT PROGRAM. 33 This division requires the state registrar of voters to 34 contract with a third-party vendor to develop or provide a 35 -18- LSB 1667XS (2) 91 ss/ns 18/ 19 S.F. 94 program to allow the state registrar to verify the status of 1 records in the statewide voter registration file and identify 2 ineligible voters on an ongoing basis. During the first 3 quarter of 2026, the bill requires the state registrar of 4 voters to utilize the program developed or provided by the 5 third-party vendor to verify the status of records in the 6 statewide voter registration file. The state registrar shall 7 forward the results of the analysis to each county commissioner 8 of registration prior to the date that county commissioners 9 of registration are required to submit voter list maintenance 10 reports. The bill requires the state registrar of voters to 11 evaluate the efficacy and cost of the pilot program as compared 12 to the current method of maintaining the statewide voter 13 registration database. The pilot program is repealed effective 14 December 31, 2028. 15 DIVISION VII ââ COUNTY HOSPITAL BOARD OF TRUSTEES. This 16 division strikes a provision setting the term length for 17 persons elected to a county hospital board of trustees in a 18 county with a population of at least 400,000 to six years, 19 returning the term length to four years. The bill does not 20 affect the term of office of a trustee elected to a county 21 public hospital board of trustees prior to July 1, 2025. 22 -19- LSB 1667XS (2) 91 ss/ns 19/ 19

This section is repealed December 31, 2028. 32 DIVISION VII 33 COUNTY HOSPITAL BOARD OF TRUSTEES 34 Sec. 38. Section 347.9, subsection 3, Code 2025, is amended 35 -15- LSB 1667XS (2) 91 ss/ns 15/ 19 S.F. 94 by striking the subsection. 1 Sec. 39. TRANSITION. This division of this Act does not 2 alter the term of office of a trustee elected to a county 3 public hospital board of trustees prior to the effective date 4 of this division of this Act. 5 EXPLANATION 6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 7 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 8 This bill relates to duties of the secretary of state, 9 including the address confidentiality program and the conduct 10 of elections. The bill is organized in divisions. 11 DIVISION I ââ ADDRESS CONFIDENTIALITY PROGRAM. This 12 division relates to the address confidentiality program, which 13 provides mail forwarding services to persons who are victims of 14 domestic abuse, domestic abuse assault, sexual abuse, assault, 15 stalking, or human trafficking, or who fear for their own 16 safety or the safety of a household member. The bill allows 17 the secretary of state to accept as a program participantâs 18 mailing address the name and other contact information of 19 a shelter in lieu of the shelterâs physical address, to 20 cancel a deceased participantâs certification, and to hold a 21 participantâs mail for up to 30 days at the request of the 22 participant. 23 DIVISION II ââ CANDIDATE ELIGIBILITY OBJECTIONS. This 24 division relates to the nomination of candidates for federal 25 office. The bill exempts candidates for federal office from 26 the requirement that a candidate sign a statement that the 27 candidate is aware that the candidate is disqualified from 28 holding office if the candidate has been convicted of a felony 29 or other infamous crime and the candidateâs rights have not 30 been restored by the governor or by the president of the United 31 States. The bill limits objections to the eligibility of a 32 candidate for a federal office that may be filed with the 33 state commissioner of elections to objections to the legal 34 sufficiency of the nomination petition or certificate of 35 -16- LSB 1667XS (2) 91 ss/ns 16/ 19 S.F. 94 election, or to the residency, age, or citizenship requirements 1 as described in the United States Constitution. With 2 respect to nominations for president or vice president of the 3 United States, the bill allows objections only to the legal 4 sufficiency of the certificate of nomination. The certificate 5 of nomination shall be presumed valid. 6 DIVISION III ââ RANKED CHOICE VOTING. This division relates 7 to the use of ranked choice and instant runoff voting for 8 elections in this state. The bill prohibits ranked choice and 9 instant runoff voting, defined in the bill as a system in which 10 voters rank multiple candidates for a single office in order of 11 preference and candidates are eliminated and votes transferred 12 between candidates in a series of rounds, from being used to 13 cast or tabulate ballots in any election in this state. 14 DIVISION IV ââ ABSENT VOTERS. This division relates to 15 the casting of ballots by absent voters. The bill strikes 16 provisions allowing a county commissioner of elections to 17 establish drop boxes to which a person can return an absentee 18 ballot. 19 The bill requires an absentee ballot that is mailed to a 20 voter to be enclosed in an unsealed affidavit envelope and with 21 or in an unsealed return envelope, which shall then be enclosed 22 in the delivery envelope. If the ballot cannot be folded so 23 that all the votes on the ballot will be hidden, the bill 24 requires the commissioner to also send a secrecy envelope. The 25 bill requires a registered voter to subscribe to an affidavit 26 on an affidavit envelope by signing the envelope and writing 27 the voterâs voter verification number. The bill also requires 28 return envelopes to have printed on them the deadline to return 29 the ballot and the manner to track the status of the ballot. 30 The bill strikes a requirement that an affidavit envelope 31 be considered to contain a defect if it appears to the county 32 commissioner of elections that it was signed by a person other 33 than the voter. The bill adds a requirement that an affidavit 34 envelope be considered to contain a defect if the voter 35 -17- LSB 1667XS (2) 91 ss/ns 17/ 19 S.F. 94 verification number on the envelope does not match the voter 1 verification number on file for the voter. 2 The bill repeals certain requirements regarding what 3 materials a commissioner shall include with an absentee ballot 4 and instead requires a commissioner to put the same serial 5 number on the affidavit, return, and delivery envelopes. 6 The bill requires all mailed absentee ballots to include an 7 affidavit envelope. The bill also requires the absentee and 8 special voters precinct board to reject an absentee ballot 9 if the affidavit envelope does not include the voterâs voter 10 verification number. 11 The bill changes the timeline for the mailing and return 12 of absentee ballots. The bill allows a county commissioner 13 of elections to mail absentee ballots to voters beginning 22 14 days before an election and requires absentee ballots to be 15 delivered to the office of the county commissioner of elections 16 by 5:00 p.m. on the day before election day. The bill also 17 requires the county commissioner of elections to record 18 the ballot as received by 11:59 p.m. on the day before the 19 election. Under current law, county commissioners of elections 20 may mail absentee ballots beginning 20 days before an election 21 and absentee ballots must be delivered to the office of the 22 county commissioner of elections not later than the time polls 23 close on election day. 24 DIVISION V ââ PERSONS PERMITTED IN VOTING BOOTHS. This 25 division amends the subsection of Code section 49.88 26 (limitation on persons in booth and time for voting) 27 prohibiting a person standing for election on the ballot before 28 a voter from occupying the voting booth with the voter and 29 Code section 49.90 (assisting voter) to say that the candidate 30 violates Code section 49.88 by occupying the voting booth with 31 the voter. 32 DIVISION VI ââ VOTER REGISTRATION DATABASE PILOT PROGRAM. 33 This division requires the state registrar of voters to 34 contract with a third-party vendor to develop or provide a 35 -18- LSB 1667XS (2) 91 ss/ns 18/ 19 S.F. 94 program to allow the state registrar to verify the status of 1 records in the statewide voter registration file and identify 2 ineligible voters on an ongoing basis. During the first 3 quarter of 2026, the bill requires the state registrar of 4 voters to utilize the program developed or provided by the 5 third-party vendor to verify the status of records in the 6 statewide voter registration file. The state registrar shall 7 forward the results of the analysis to each county commissioner 8 of registration prior to the date that county commissioners 9 of registration are required to submit voter list maintenance 10 reports. The bill requires the state registrar of voters to 11 evaluate the efficacy and cost of the pilot program as compared 12 to the current method of maintaining the statewide voter 13 registration database. The pilot program is repealed effective 14 December 31, 2028. 15 DIVISION VII ââ COUNTY HOSPITAL BOARD OF TRUSTEES. This 16 division strikes a provision setting the term length for 17 persons elected to a county hospital board of trustees in a 18 county with a population of at least 400,000 to six years, 19 returning the term length to four years. The bill does not 20 affect the term of office of a trustee elected to a county 21 public hospital board of trustees prior to July 1, 2025. 22 -19- LSB 1667XS (2) 91 ss/ns 19/ 19
