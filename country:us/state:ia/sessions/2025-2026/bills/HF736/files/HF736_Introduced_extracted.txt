The department shall not prohibit 23 longitudinal transmission line installations extending any 24 distance on a primary road right-of-way, including on an 25 interstate road right-of-way, unless the department determines 26 such an installation would endanger public safety or interfere 27 with the proper function of the highway. The rules shall must 28 recognize emergency situations and the need for immediate 29 installation of service extensions subject to the standards 30 adopted by the department and the utilities commission. The 31 rules shall not be no less stringent than the standards 32 adopted by the utilities commission pursuant to chapters 478 , 33 479 , and 479B .

The plan shall be 19 consistent with the rules of the federal highway administration 20 of the United States department of transportation and shall 21 be submitted to the federal highway administration for its 22 approval by January 1, 1989. In developing the plan, the 23 department shall provide for extended payment and lease 24 agreements to provide continuous funding for the living roadway 25 trust fund. The department shall not provide for payment and 26 lease agreements for a term that exceeds twenty years. The 27 plan shall provide for charges for the use of the right-of-way 28 and all moneys collected shall be credited to the living 29 roadway trust fund established under section 314.21 . 30 Sec. 4.

Affected parties are invited 17 to participate in development meetings. However, failure 18 to participate during the design phase does not prevent a 19 construction project from moving forward. The bill requires 20 the DOT, upon written request, to engage in coordination 21 activities with a utility or transmission line developer 22 to review highway corridors identified in the request for 23 potential locations to place transmission lines. The DOT must 24 share all known plans with affected utility or transmission 25 line developers on planned future projects in the highway 26 corridor if the planned highway project impacts the placement 27 or siting of transmission lines. 28 Under current law, the DOT is required to adopt 29 administrative rules embodying a utility accommodation policy 30 imposing reasonable restrictions on utility line placements on 31 primary road rights-of-way. The bill prohibits the DOT from 32 denying longitudinal transmission line installations extending 33 any distance on a primary road right-of-way unless the DOT 34 determines such an installation would endanger public safety 35 -3- LSB 2724YH (7) 91 th/ns 3/ 4 H.F. 736 or interfere with the proper function of the highway. The 1 DOT must make the reasons for denying the installation of a 2 longitudinal transmission line available to the public within 3 90 days. 4 The DOT was previously required to develop an accommodation 5 plan for the longitudinal utility use of freeway right-of-way, 6 in consultation with the utilities commission. The DOT 7 must also provide for extended payment and lease agreements 8 to provide continuous funding for the living roadway trust 9 fund. The bill strikes the requirement that the agreements 10 be âextendedâ and the funding be âcontinuousâ and instead 11 prohibits the DOT from providing for payment and lease 12 agreements for a term that exceeds 20 years. 13 Current law requires transmission lines to be constructed 14 near and parallel to roads, highways, and railways. The bill 15 adds to the designated locations for transmission lines to be 16 constructed within the right-of-way beside roads, highways, and 17 railways. The lines must not interfere with the use by the 18 public of the highways or streams, nor unnecessarily interfere 19 with the use of any lands by the occupant. 20 -4- LSB 2724YH (7) 91 th/ns 4/ 4
