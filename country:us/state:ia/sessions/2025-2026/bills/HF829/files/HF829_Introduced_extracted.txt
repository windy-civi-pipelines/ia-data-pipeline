Notwithstanding section 602.8107, subsection 5, 1 paragraph âbâ or âcâ, or any other provision of law to the 2 contrary, the clerk of the district court shall, on the 3 effective date of this Act, charge off the remaining balance of 4 any delinquent criminal fine or penalty, surcharge, or court 5 costs owed by a person resulting from a violation of a law 6 regulating the operation of a motor vehicle. The state shall 7 not seek any contempt or civil action related to the delinquent 8 amount charged off. Upon charging off the delinquent amount, 9 the criminal fine or penalty, surcharge, and court costs shall 10 be considered paid in full. 11 2. This section applies to any delinquent criminal fine or 12 penalty, surcharge, or court costs resulting from a violation 13 of a law regulating the operation of a motor vehicle and deemed 14 delinquent on or before the effective date of this Act. 15 EXPLANATION 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 17 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 18 Under current law, the department of transportation (DOT) 19 is required to suspend the driverâs license of a person who, 20 upon conviction of violating a law regulating the operation of 21 a motor vehicle, has failed to timely pay the criminal fine, 22 penalty, surcharge, or court costs. The clerk of the district 23 court must mail notice to a person who has failed to pay the 24 required court debts and provide 60 days for the person to make 25 the payment. If payment is not received, the clerk of the 26 district court must notify the DOT to initiate the suspension. 27 If after suspension, the person enters into an installment 28 agreement to pay the court debts, the personâs license must be 29 reinstated by the DOT. However, the personâs license may be 30 suspended again if the person is convicted of an additional 31 violation of a law regulating the operation of a motor vehicle, 32 or if the person defaults on the installment agreement. 33 This bill repeals Code section 321.210A which provides for 34 the suspension of a driverâs license for failure to pay a fine, 35 -6- LSB 2552YH (4) 91 th/ns 6/ 7 H.F. 829 penalty, surcharge, or court costs. 1 The bill narrows Code section 321.210B (installment 2 agreements) to only court debt resulting from a violation under 3 Code chapter 321 or 321J relating to the operation of a motor 4 vehicle and requires an installment agreement to be based on 5 the personâs income and ability to pay. In addition, the bill 6 authorizes a person to perform community service work of an 7 equivalent value to the delinquent amount in lieu of paying the 8 delinquent amount. 9 The bill requires the DOT to reinstate all driverâs licenses 10 that have been suspended by the DOT pursuant to Code section 11 321.210A, and a person whose license has been reinstated 12 pursuant to the bill may apply for a replacement driverâs 13 license pursuant to Code section 321.189. 14 The bill requires the clerk of the district court to charge 15 off the remaining balance of any delinquent criminal fine or 16 penalty, surcharge, or court costs owed by a person resulting 17 from a violation of a law regulating the operation of a motor 18 vehicle. Upon charging off the delinquent amount, the criminal 19 fine or penalty, surcharge, and court costs will be considered 20 paid in full. The charge-off provision applies only to such 21 a criminal fine or penalty, surcharge, or court costs deemed 22 delinquent on or before the effective date of the bill. 23 The bill does not affect the DOTâs ability to act against a 24 personâs driverâs license for reasons other than nonpayment of 25 court debt. 26 -7- LSB 2552YH (4) 91 th/ns 7/ 7

This section applies to any delinquent criminal fine or 12 penalty, surcharge, or court costs resulting from a violation 13 of a law regulating the operation of a motor vehicle and deemed 14 delinquent on or before the effective date of this Act. 15 EXPLANATION 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 17 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 18 Under current law, the department of transportation (DOT) 19 is required to suspend the driverâs license of a person who, 20 upon conviction of violating a law regulating the operation of 21 a motor vehicle, has failed to timely pay the criminal fine, 22 penalty, surcharge, or court costs. The clerk of the district 23 court must mail notice to a person who has failed to pay the 24 required court debts and provide 60 days for the person to make 25 the payment. If payment is not received, the clerk of the 26 district court must notify the DOT to initiate the suspension. 27 If after suspension, the person enters into an installment 28 agreement to pay the court debts, the personâs license must be 29 reinstated by the DOT. However, the personâs license may be 30 suspended again if the person is convicted of an additional 31 violation of a law regulating the operation of a motor vehicle, 32 or if the person defaults on the installment agreement. 33 This bill repeals Code section 321.210A which provides for 34 the suspension of a driverâs license for failure to pay a fine, 35 -6- LSB 2552YH (4) 91 th/ns 6/ 7 H.F. 829 penalty, surcharge, or court costs. 1 The bill narrows Code section 321.210B (installment 2 agreements) to only court debt resulting from a violation under 3 Code chapter 321 or 321J relating to the operation of a motor 4 vehicle and requires an installment agreement to be based on 5 the personâs income and ability to pay. In addition, the bill 6 authorizes a person to perform community service work of an 7 equivalent value to the delinquent amount in lieu of paying the 8 delinquent amount. 9 The bill requires the DOT to reinstate all driverâs licenses 10 that have been suspended by the DOT pursuant to Code section 11 321.210A, and a person whose license has been reinstated 12 pursuant to the bill may apply for a replacement driverâs 13 license pursuant to Code section 321.189. 14 The bill requires the clerk of the district court to charge 15 off the remaining balance of any delinquent criminal fine or 16 penalty, surcharge, or court costs owed by a person resulting 17 from a violation of a law regulating the operation of a motor 18 vehicle. Upon charging off the delinquent amount, the criminal 19 fine or penalty, surcharge, and court costs will be considered 20 paid in full. The charge-off provision applies only to such 21 a criminal fine or penalty, surcharge, or court costs deemed 22 delinquent on or before the effective date of the bill. 23 The bill does not affect the DOTâs ability to act against a 24 personâs driverâs license for reasons other than nonpayment of 25 court debt. 26 -7- LSB 2552YH (4) 91 th/ns 7/ 7
