Section 1:
House File 666 - Introduced HOUSE FILE 666 BY SHIPLEY , THOMPSON , FETT , HENDERSON , CISNEROS , GERHOLD , HAYES , WENGRYN , and FISHER A BILL FOR An Act relating to the Iowa human life protection Act, 1 providing for civil actions and civil penalties, and 2 including effective date provisions. 3 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF IOWA: 4 TLSB 2020YH (3) 91 lh/ko H.F. 666 Section 1. FINDINGS. 1 1. The general assembly acknowledges that all human beings 2 are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain 3 unalienable rights, the foremost of which is the right to life. 4 2. The life of every human being begins at fertilization 5 when a male sperm fuses with a female egg resulting in a 6 single-celled human called a zygote. The union of the male 7 and female deoxyribonucleic acid during fertilization restores 8 the number of chromosomes needed to create a new human being. 9 The Carnegie stages of human development, numbered one to 10 twenty-three, is the accepted standard of embryological 11 development used by biologists to describe the physical 12 features of the human being, with the first stage marked by the 13 moment of fertilization through sperm-egg fusion and the last 14 stage at an estimated postfertilization age of eight weeks when 15 over ninety percent of the more than four thousand five hundred 16 named body structures are present. 17 3. The state of Iowa has a fundamental and compelling 18 interest in protecting the life of every human being from the 19 moment of fertilization. 20 4. Abortion is a murderous act of violence that purposefully 21 and knowingly terminates a human life in the womb. 22 5. Unborn human beings are entitled to the full and equal 23 protection of the laws that prohibit violence against other 24 human beings. 25 6. The United States Supreme Courtâs ruling in Dobbs v. 26 Jackson Womenâs Health Organization, No. 19-1392, 597 U.S. ___ 27 (2022), correctly overruled the lawless and unconstitutional 28 pronouncements in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) and Planned 29 Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 30 833 (1992), which had invented and perpetuated a supposed 31 constitutional right to abortion that cannot be found anywhere 32 in the text of the Constitution of the United States. 33 7. It is a federal crime pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Â§1461 to 34 mail abortion pills or to receive them in the mail, punishable 35 -1- LSB 2020YH (3) 91 lh/ko 1/ 51 H.F. 666 by imprisonment for five years. It is also a federal crime 1 to transport abortion pills in interstate or foreign commerce 2 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Â§1462(c). These statutes are fully 3 enforceable now that Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), has been 4 overruled. The statute of limitations for each of these crimes 5 is five years. 6 8. Violations of 18 U.S.C. Â§1461 and Â§1462 are predicate 7 offenses under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt 8 Organizations Act (RICO), which exposes abortion pill 9 distribution networks and their donors to civil RICO liability 10 as well as criminal prosecution as a racketeering enterprise 11 under 18 U.S.C. Â§1961. 12 9. The general assembly calls upon the United States 13 attorneys for the northern and southern districts of Iowa to 14 investigate and prosecute every abortion pill distribution 15 network under 18 U.S.C. Â§1461 and Â§1462 and RICO. 16 Sec. 2. NEW SECTION . 146F.1 Short title. 17 This chapter shall be known, and may be cited, as the âIowa 18 Human Life Protection Actâ . 19 Sec. 3.

The bill includes findings relating to human life 35 -35- LSB 2020YH (3) 91 lh/ko 35/ 51 H.F. 666 and abortion. 1 New Code section 146F.2 provides definitions used in the 2 new Code chapter including âabortion fundâ, âabortion-inducing 3 drugâ, âabortion providerâ, âaffiliateâ, âaiding or abettingâ, 4 âattemptâ or âattemptsâ, âelective abortionâ, âfertilizationâ, 5 âgovernmental entityâ, âinformation content providerâ, 6 âinteractive computer serviceâ, âmajor bodily functionâ, 7 âmedical emergencyâ, âmedically indicated separation 8 procedureâ, âperformâ, âperformanceâ, âperformedâ, âperformsâ, 9 or âperformingâ relative to an elective abortion, âpersonâ, 10 âpolicyâ, âpolitical subdivisionâ, âpregnantâ, âtaxpayer 11 resource transactionâ, âunborn childâ, and âwomanâ or âwomenâ. 12 New Code section 146F.3 prohibits a person from knowingly 13 using, employing, or administering any drug, instrument, 14 device, means, or procedure upon a pregnant woman with the 15 specific intent to cause an elective abortion, or from aiding 16 or abetting such conduct. The prohibition applies if any 17 portion of the prohibited conduct or elective abortion occurs 18 in the state or within the jurisdiction of the state. 19 The requirements of new Code section 146F.3 shall be 20 enforced exclusively through the qui tam actions described in 21 the bill; direct or indirect enforcement shall not be taken 22 or threatened; and a violation of the Code section shall not 23 be used to justify or trigger the enforcement of any other 24 law or any type of adverse consequence under any other law, 25 except as provided in the provisions of the bill relating to 26 qui tam actions. However, the Code section does not preclude 27 or limit the enforcement of any other law or regulation against 28 conduct that is independently prohibited by such other law or 29 regulation and that would remain prohibited by such other law 30 or regulation. The prohibition does not apply to speech or 31 conduct protected by the first amendment to the Constitution of 32 the United States; conduct the state is forbidden to regulate 33 under federal law or the Constitution of the United States; the 34 provision of basic public services by a governmental entity or 35 -36- LSB 2020YH (3) 91 lh/ko 36/ 51 H.F. 666 a common carrier to an abortion provider, an abortion fund, or 1 an affiliate of an abortion provider or abortion fund in the 2 same manner those services are provided to the general public; 3 or conduct taken at the behest of a federal agency, contractor, 4 or employee that is carrying out duties under federal law, if 5 a prohibition on that conduct would violate the doctrine of 6 preemption or intergovernmental immunity. 7 New Code section 146F.4 provides for liability for wrongful 8 death and personal injuries related to an elective abortion. 9 The Code section provides that a person who violates new 10 Code section 146F.3 shall be subject to joint and several 11 liability for the wrongful death of an unborn child who dies 12 from the elective abortion; and strict, and joint and several 13 liability for the wrongful death of a pregnant woman or 14 formerly pregnant woman who dies from the elective abortion and 15 any personal injuries suffered by an unborn child or pregnant 16 woman or formerly pregnant woman from the elective abortion. 17 A surviving parent of an unborn child who was aborted in 18 violation of the bill may maintain an action for wrongful death 19 against a person who knowingly violated the bill resulting in 20 the wrongful death of the unborn child. 21 The bill prohibits a lawsuit under new Code section 146E.4 22 against and by certain people including: against a pregnant 23 woman or formerly pregnant woman who aborted or attempted to 24 abort the pregnant womanâs unborn child; against a person 25 that acted at the behest of a federal agency, contractor, or 26 employee that is carrying out duties under federal law, if 27 the imposition of liability would violate the doctrine of 28 preemption or intergovernmental immunity; by a person who 29 through an act of sexual assault or incest impregnated the 30 pregnant woman or formerly pregnant woman; and against a 31 provider or user of an interactive computer service if such 32 a lawsuit would be preempted by federal law. A prevailing 33 plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages, court 34 costs and reasonable attorney fees, and punitive damages of not 35 -37- LSB 2020YH (3) 91 lh/ko 37/ 51 H.F. 666 less than $100,000. 1 Under new Code section 146F.4, if a plaintiff brings suit in 2 response to a drug-induced abortion and is unable to identify 3 the specific manufacturer of the abortion-inducing drug that 4 caused the death or injury, liability is apportioned among all 5 manufacturers of abortion-inducing drugs in proportion to each 6 manufacturerâs share of the market for abortion-inducing drugs. 7 A person may bring an action no later than six years from the 8 date the cause of action accrues. Waiver of the right to sue is 9 void as against public policy and shall not be enforceable in 10 any court. The Code section shall not be construed to impose 11 liability on constitutionally protected speech or conduct. 12 New Code section 146F.5 relates to prohibitions related 13 to abortion-inducing drugs and qui tam enforcement. The 14 Code section provides that it is unlawful for a person 15 to manufacture, possess, or distribute abortion-inducing 16 drugs in the state; mail, transport, deliver, or provide 17 abortion-inducing drugs in any manner to or from a person 18 or location in the state; or engage in any conduct that 19 constitutes aiding and abetting the manufacture, possession, 20 distribution, mailing, transporting, delivery, or provision 21 of abortion-inducing drugs. The bill does not prohibit 22 constitutionally protected speech or conduct; conduct that 23 the state is forbidden to regulate under federal law or the 24 Constitution of the United States; conduct taken at the behest 25 of a federal agency, contractor, or employee that is carrying 26 out duties under federal law, if a prohibition on that conduct 27 would violate the doctrine of preemption or intergovernmental 28 immunity; conduct taken by a pregnant woman or formerly 29 pregnant woman who aborts or seeks to abort the womanâs unborn 30 child; the manufacture, possession, distribution, mailing, 31 transporting, delivery, or provision of abortion-inducing drugs 32 for a purpose that does not include termination of a pregnancy; 33 the possession of abortion-inducing drugs related to an effort 34 to entrap persons that violate the Code section; or any of the 35 -38- LSB 2020YH (3) 91 lh/ko 38/ 51 H.F. 666 conduct described under the section of the bill relating to 1 interactive computer services. 2 New Code section 146F.5 shall only be enforced as a qui 3 tam action as provided under the bill and direct or indirect 4 enforcement of the Code section shall not be taken or 5 threatened. However, the Code section does not preclude or 6 limit the enforcement of any other law or regulation against 7 conduct that is independently prohibited by such other law or 8 regulation, and that would remain prohibited by such other law 9 or regulation. 10 New Code section 146F.6 relates to liability for wrongful 11 death and personal injuries related to the manufacture, 12 mailing, distribution, transportation, delivery, or provision 13 of abortion-inducing drugs. The Code section provides that 14 a person who manufactures, mails, distributes, transports, 15 delivers, or provides abortion-inducing drugs; or who aids or 16 abets the manufacture, mailing, distribution, transportation, 17 delivery, or provision of abortion-inducing drugs shall be 18 strictly, and jointly and severally liable for the wrongful 19 death of an unborn child or pregnant woman who dies from the 20 use of abortion-inducing drugs, and for any personal injuries 21 suffered by an unborn child or pregnant woman or formerly 22 pregnant woman from the use of abortion-inducing drugs. The 23 surviving parents of an unborn child who was aborted in 24 violation of the Code section of the bill relating to elective 25 abortion prohibitions may maintain an action for wrongful 26 death against a person who knowingly violated the Code section 27 resulting in the wrongful death of the unborn child. 28 New Code section 146F.6 prohibits a lawsuit from being 29 brought against a pregnant woman or formerly pregnant woman who 30 used or sought to obtain abortion-inducing drugs to abort or 31 attempt to abort her unborn child; against a person that acted 32 at the behest of a federal agency, contractor, or employee that 33 is carrying out duties under federal law, if the imposition 34 of liability would violate the doctrine of preemption or 35 -39- LSB 2020YH (3) 91 lh/ko 39/ 51 H.F. 666 intergovernmental immunity; by a person who, through an act 1 of sexual assault or incest, impregnated the woman who used 2 abortion-inducing drugs; or against a provider or user of 3 an interactive computer service if such a lawsuit would be 4 preempted by federal law. 5 A prevailing plaintiff under new Code section 146E.6 is 6 entitled to recover compensatory damages, court costs and 7 reasonable attorney fees, and punitive damages of not less 8 than $100,000. If a plaintiff brings suit in response to a 9 drug-induced abortion and is unable to identify the specific 10 manufacturer of the abortion-inducing drug that caused the 11 death or injury, liability shall be apportioned among all 12 manufacturers of abortion-inducing drugs in proportion to 13 each manufacturerâs share of the market for abortion-inducing 14 drugs. A person may bring an action no later than six years 15 from the date the cause of action accrues. Waiver of the 16 right to sue is void as against public policy and shall not be 17 enforceable in any court. It is an affirmative defense if a 18 person sued under this Code section was unaware that the person 19 was engaged in the conduct described in this Code section, and 20 took every reasonable precaution to ensure that the person 21 would not manufacture, mail, distribute, transport, deliver, 22 provide, or aid or abet the manufacture, mailing, distribution, 23 transportation, delivery, or provision of abortion-inducing 24 drugs. The defendant has the burden of proving an affirmative 25 defense by a preponderance of the evidence. The Code section 26 shall not be construed to impose liability on constitutionally 27 protected speech or conduct. 28 New Code section 146F.7 provides for qui tam enforcement 29 for certain violations under the bill. A person, other than a 30 governmental entity or an officer or employee of a governmental 31 entity, has standing to bring and may bring a qui tam action 32 against any person that violates any provision of new Code 33 section 146F.3 (elective abortion prohibitions), 146F.4 34 (abortion-inducing drugs prohibitions), or 146F.14 (government 35 -40- LSB 2020YH (3) 91 lh/ko 40/ 51 H.F. 666 contractors and grant recipients); or any person who intends 1 to violate any provision of those Code sections. A civil 2 action shall not be brought under the Code section against 3 the pregnant woman or formerly pregnant woman upon whom an 4 elective abortion was performed or induced or attempted to be 5 performed or induced or against a pregnant woman who intends 6 or who seeks an elective abortion in violation of the new Code 7 chapter; against any person that performs, aids or abets, or 8 attempts to perform or aid or abet an elective abortion at 9 the behest of a federal agency, contractor, or employee that 10 is carrying out duties under federal law, if a prohibition on 11 that elective abortion would violate the doctrine of preemption 12 or intergovernmental immunity; against a common carrier that 13 transports a pregnant woman to an abortion provider, if the 14 common carrier is unaware that the pregnant woman intends to 15 abort the pregnant womanâs unborn child; against a provider 16 or user of an interactive computer service if such a lawsuit 17 would be preempted by federal law; or by a person who, through 18 an act of sexual assault or incest, impregnated a woman who is 19 seeking an elective abortion or a person who acts in concert 20 or participation with the person who impregnated the woman. 21 An action shall be brought in the name of the person and of 22 the state. A plaintiff who prevails in an action under this 23 Code section shall be awarded injunctive relief, nominal and 24 compensatory damages if the plaintiff has suffered injury or 25 harm from the defendantâs conduct, civil penalties of not 26 less than $10,000 for each violation, and court costs and 27 reasonable attorney fees. A person may bring an action no 28 later than six years from the date the cause of action accrues. 29 It is an affirmative defense if a person sued was unaware 30 that the person was engaged in the specified conduct and took 31 every reasonable precaution to ensure that the person would 32 not be in violation of the specified provisions of the bill. 33 The Code section shall not be construed to impose liability 34 on constitutionally protected speech or conduct. A court 35 -41- LSB 2020YH (3) 91 lh/ko 41/ 51 H.F. 666 shall not award court costs or reasonable attorney fees to a 1 defendant. A person bringing an action is entitled to receive 2 25 percent of the civil penalties recovered, with the remaining 3 civil penalties paid to the state. The state is not liable for 4 expenses that a person incurs in bringing an action. 5 New Code section 146F.8 provides for qui tam enforcement 6 for violations relating to interactive computer services. The 7 Code section provides that a person, other than a governmental 8 entity or an officer or employee of a governmental entity, 9 has standing to bring and may bring a qui tam action against 10 a person that provides or maintains an interactive computer 11 service that allows Iowa residents to access information or 12 material that assists or facilitates efforts to obtain elective 13 abortions or abortion-inducing drugs; provides or maintains 14 a platform for downloading any application or software for 15 use on a computer or electronic device that is designed to 16 assist or facilitate efforts to obtain elective abortions or 17 abortion-inducing drugs; or provides or maintains a platform 18 that allows or enables those who provide or aid or abet 19 elective abortions, or those who manufacture, mail, distribute, 20 transport, deliver, or provide abortion-inducing drugs, to 21 collect money, digital currency, resources, or any other thing 22 of value in exchange for such services. 23 An action under new Code section 146F.8 shall be brought in 24 the name of the person and the state. A prevailing plaintiff 25 shall only be awarded declaratory and injunctive relief, not 26 damages. Relief shall not be awarded if the action is brought 27 in response to the exercise of state or federal constitutional 28 rights that belong personally to the defendant; conduct taken 29 at the behest of a federal agency, contractor, or employee 30 that is carrying out duties under federal law, if the relief 31 would violate the doctrine of preemption or intergovernmental 32 immunity; or conduct taken by a pregnant woman or formerly 33 pregnant woman who aborted or attempted to abort such womanâs 34 unborn child, if such woman is the named defendant in the civil 35 -42- LSB 2020YH (3) 91 lh/ko 42/ 51 H.F. 666 action. 1 Under new Code section 146F.8, it is an affirmative 2 defense if a person who sued was unaware that the personâs 3 interactive computer service or platform was being used to 4 assist or facilitate efforts to obtain elective abortions 5 or abortion-inducing drugs; and upon discovering that the 6 personâs interactive computer service or platform was being 7 used to assist or facilitate such efforts, the person took 8 prompt action to block access to any information, material, 9 application, or software and to block those who provide or aid 10 or abet elective abortions and those who manufacture, mail, 11 distribute, transport, deliver, or provide abortion-inducing 12 drugs, from collecting money, digital currency, resources, 13 or any other thing of value in exchange for such services 14 through its interactive computer service or platform. The 15 defendant has the burden of proving an affirmative defense by 16 a preponderance of the evidence. A person who engages in the 17 violative conduct shall not be held vicariously liable for 18 any nominal, statutory, or compensatory damages incurred by 19 another information content provider; held liable or legally 20 responsible for the conduct of any publisher or speaker of any 21 information provided by another information content provider; 22 or treated as the speaker or publisher of any information 23 provided by another information content provider under any 24 provision of state law. 25 New Code section 146F.8 shall be enforced exclusively 26 through the qui tam action and direct or indirect enforcement 27 of this Code section shall not be taken or threatened. 28 However, the Code section does not preclude or limit the 29 enforcement of any other law or regulation against conduct that 30 is independently prohibited by such other law or regulation, 31 and that would remain prohibited by such other law or 32 regulation in the absence of the Code section. 33 Under new Code section 146F.8, a provider or user of 34 an interactive computer service shall have absolute and 35 -43- LSB 2020YH (3) 91 lh/ko 43/ 51 H.F. 666 nonwaivable immunity from liability or suit on account of 1 an action taken to restrict access to or availability of 2 information or material that assists or facilitates access to 3 elective abortions or abortion-inducing drugs, whether or not 4 such information or material is constitutionally protected; an 5 action taken to enable or make available to information content 6 providers or others the technical means to restrict access 7 to information or material described in the Code section; 8 or a denial of service to those who provide or aid or abet 9 elective abortions, or those who manufacture, mail, distribute, 10 transport, deliver, or provide abortion-inducing drugs. The 11 state is not liable for expenses that a person incurs in 12 bringing an action under the Code section. 13 New Code section 146F.9 provides affirmative defenses for 14 a defendant against whom an action is brought under new Code 15 section 146F.6 (liability for wrongful death and personal 16 injury ââ abortion-inducing drugs), 146F.7 (qui tam enforcement 17 for certain violations), or 146F.8 (qui tam enforcement ââ 18 interactive computer services). The defendant must prove 19 the affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence. 20 The Code section does not limit or preclude a defendant 21 from asserting the unconstitutionality of any provision or 22 application of state law as a defense or from asserting any 23 other defense that might be available under any other source 24 of law. A court shall not apply the law of another state or 25 jurisdiction to any civil action brought under the specified 26 Code sections, unless otherwise required by law. 27 New Code section 146F.10 specifies the defenses that are 28 not applicable to an action brought under Code section 146F.4 29 (liability for wrongful death and personal injury ââ elective 30 abortion), 146F.6, or 146F.7. 31 New Code section 146F.11 includes venue provisions and 32 provides that if an action is brought under new Code section 33 146F.6, 146F.7, or 146F.8, the action shall not be transferred 34 to a different venue without the written consent of all 35 -44- LSB 2020YH (3) 91 lh/ko 44/ 51 H.F. 666 parties. 1 New Code section 146F.12 includes provisions relating 2 to personal jurisdiction, choice of law, and class action 3 lawsuits.

An internet service provider shall have absolute 8 and nonwaivable immunity from liability or suit on account 9 of an action taken as described in the Code section. If a 10 lawsuit is brought or a judgment entered against an internet 11 service provider in any state or federal court based on the 12 internet service providerâs compliance with the Code section, 13 the internet service provider may recover costs related to the 14 action as well as compensatory damages and statutory damages of 15 not less than $100,000. 16 New Code section 146F.16 relates to internet service in 17 publicly owned buildings, public libraries, school district 18 locations, and institutions of higher education relative to 19 access to certain information.

A 6 political subdivision may enact and enforce ordinances 7 regulating, restricting, or prohibiting elective abortion and 8 conduct that aids or abets elective abortion. A provision 9 of state law shall not be construed to limit a political 10 subdivision from enacting or enforcing ordinances regulating, 11 restricting, or prohibiting elective abortion and conduct 12 that aids or abets elective abortion, unless it clearly and 13 explicitly does so with specific reference to the Code section. 14 The Code section also prohibits a governmental entity from 15 entering into a taxpayer resource transaction with certain 16 entities unless required to do so by federal law or as a 17 condition of receiving federal funds. A person has standing 18 to bring and may bring a qui tam action against any person 19 that enacts, issues, enforces, or attempts to enforce any 20 ordinance, order, rule, directive, requirement, or written or 21 unwritten policy described in the Code section or that enters 22 into a taxpayer resource transaction described in the Code 23 section.

The Code section provides the forum 35 -49- LSB 2020YH (3) 91 lh/ko 49/ 51 H.F. 666 in which action may be brought and prohibits any contractual 1 choice-of-forum provision. 2 New Code section 146F.20 relates to immunity from suit 3 and limits on state court jurisdiction. The state, its 4 political subdivisions, an officer and employee of the state 5 or a political subdivision shall have sovereign immunity, 6 governmental immunity, and official immunity as described in 7 the bill. 8 Under new Code section 146F.20, any judicial relief issued 9 by a court of this state that disregards the immunities 10 conferred or the jurisdictional limitations specified shall 11 be a legal nullity due to lack of jurisdiction, and shall 12 not be enforced or obeyed by any officer or employee of this 13 state or a political subdivision, judicial or otherwise. 14 Any injunction, declaratory judgment, or writ issued by a 15 court of this state that purports to restrain the state, 16 its political subdivisions, an officer or employee of this 17 state or a political subdivision, or any person from hearing, 18 adjudicating, docketing, or filing a civil action brought under 19 new Code section 146F.6, 146F.7, or 146F.8, shall be a legal 20 nullity and a violation of the due process clause and shall not 21 be enforced or obeyed by any officer or employee of this state 22 or a political subdivision, judicial or otherwise.

Raw Text:
House File 666 - Introduced HOUSE FILE 666 BY SHIPLEY , THOMPSON , FETT , HENDERSON , CISNEROS , GERHOLD , HAYES , WENGRYN , and FISHER A BILL FOR An Act relating to the Iowa human life protection Act, 1 providing for civil actions and civil penalties, and 2 including effective date provisions. 3 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF IOWA: 4 TLSB 2020YH (3) 91 lh/ko H.F. 666 Section 1. FINDINGS. 1 1. The general assembly acknowledges that all human beings 2 are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain 3 unalienable rights, the foremost of which is the right to life. 4 2. The life of every human being begins at fertilization 5 when a male sperm fuses with a female egg resulting in a 6 single-celled human called a zygote. The union of the male 7 and female deoxyribonucleic acid during fertilization restores 8 the number of chromosomes needed to create a new human being. 9 The Carnegie stages of human development, numbered one to 10 twenty-three, is the accepted standard of embryological 11 development used by biologists to describe the physical 12 features of the human being, with the first stage marked by the 13 moment of fertilization through sperm-egg fusion and the last 14 stage at an estimated postfertilization age of eight weeks when 15 over ninety percent of the more than four thousand five hundred 16 named body structures are present. 17 3. The state of Iowa has a fundamental and compelling 18 interest in protecting the life of every human being from the 19 moment of fertilization. 20 4. Abortion is a murderous act of violence that purposefully 21 and knowingly terminates a human life in the womb. 22 5. Unborn human beings are entitled to the full and equal 23 protection of the laws that prohibit violence against other 24 human beings. 25 6. The United States Supreme Courtâs ruling in Dobbs v. 26 Jackson Womenâs Health Organization, No. 19-1392, 597 U.S. ___ 27 (2022), correctly overruled the lawless and unconstitutional 28 pronouncements in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) and Planned 29 Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 30 833 (1992), which had invented and perpetuated a supposed 31 constitutional right to abortion that cannot be found anywhere 32 in the text of the Constitution of the United States. 33 7. It is a federal crime pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Â§1461 to 34 mail abortion pills or to receive them in the mail, punishable 35 -1- LSB 2020YH (3) 91 lh/ko 1/ 51 H.F. 666 by imprisonment for five years. It is also a federal crime 1 to transport abortion pills in interstate or foreign commerce 2 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Â§1462(c). These statutes are fully 3 enforceable now that Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), has been 4 overruled. The statute of limitations for each of these crimes 5 is five years. 6 8. Violations of 18 U.S.C. Â§1461 and Â§1462 are predicate 7 offenses under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt 8 Organizations Act (RICO), which exposes abortion pill 9 distribution networks and their donors to civil RICO liability 10 as well as criminal prosecution as a racketeering enterprise 11 under 18 U.S.C. Â§1961. 12 9. The general assembly calls upon the United States 13 attorneys for the northern and southern districts of Iowa to 14 investigate and prosecute every abortion pill distribution 15 network under 18 U.S.C. Â§1461 and Â§1462 and RICO. 16 Sec. 2. NEW SECTION . 146F.1 Short title. 17 This chapter shall be known, and may be cited, as the âIowa 18 Human Life Protection Actâ . 19 Sec. 3.

Waiver of the right to sue is 9 void as against public policy and shall not be enforceable in 10 any court. The Code section shall not be construed to impose 11 liability on constitutionally protected speech or conduct. 12 New Code section 146F.5 relates to prohibitions related 13 to abortion-inducing drugs and qui tam enforcement. The 14 Code section provides that it is unlawful for a person 15 to manufacture, possess, or distribute abortion-inducing 16 drugs in the state; mail, transport, deliver, or provide 17 abortion-inducing drugs in any manner to or from a person 18 or location in the state; or engage in any conduct that 19 constitutes aiding and abetting the manufacture, possession, 20 distribution, mailing, transporting, delivery, or provision 21 of abortion-inducing drugs.

If a plaintiff brings suit in response to a 9 drug-induced abortion and is unable to identify the specific 10 manufacturer of the abortion-inducing drug that caused the 11 death or injury, liability shall be apportioned among all 12 manufacturers of abortion-inducing drugs in proportion to 13 each manufacturerâs share of the market for abortion-inducing 14 drugs. A person may bring an action no later than six years 15 from the date the cause of action accrues. Waiver of the 16 right to sue is void as against public policy and shall not be 17 enforceable in any court. It is an affirmative defense if a 18 person sued under this Code section was unaware that the person 19 was engaged in the conduct described in this Code section, and 20 took every reasonable precaution to ensure that the person 21 would not manufacture, mail, distribute, transport, deliver, 22 provide, or aid or abet the manufacture, mailing, distribution, 23 transportation, delivery, or provision of abortion-inducing 24 drugs.

A person may bring an action no 28 later than six years from the date the cause of action accrues. 29 It is an affirmative defense if a person sued was unaware 30 that the person was engaged in the specified conduct and took 31 every reasonable precaution to ensure that the person would 32 not be in violation of the specified provisions of the bill. 33 The Code section shall not be construed to impose liability 34 on constitutionally protected speech or conduct. A court 35 -41- LSB 2020YH (3) 91 lh/ko 41/ 51 H.F. 666 shall not award court costs or reasonable attorney fees to a 1 defendant.

A prevailing plaintiff 25 shall only be awarded declaratory and injunctive relief, not 26 damages. Relief shall not be awarded if the action is brought 27 in response to the exercise of state or federal constitutional 28 rights that belong personally to the defendant; conduct taken 29 at the behest of a federal agency, contractor, or employee 30 that is carrying out duties under federal law, if the relief 31 would violate the doctrine of preemption or intergovernmental 32 immunity; or conduct taken by a pregnant woman or formerly 33 pregnant woman who aborted or attempted to abort such womanâs 34 unborn child, if such woman is the named defendant in the civil 35 -42- LSB 2020YH (3) 91 lh/ko 42/ 51 H.F. 666 action. 1 Under new Code section 146F.8, it is an affirmative 2 defense if a person who sued was unaware that the personâs 3 interactive computer service or platform was being used to 4 assist or facilitate efforts to obtain elective abortions 5 or abortion-inducing drugs; and upon discovering that the 6 personâs interactive computer service or platform was being 7 used to assist or facilitate such efforts, the person took 8 prompt action to block access to any information, material, 9 application, or software and to block those who provide or aid 10 or abet elective abortions and those who manufacture, mail, 11 distribute, transport, deliver, or provide abortion-inducing 12 drugs, from collecting money, digital currency, resources, 13 or any other thing of value in exchange for such services 14 through its interactive computer service or platform. The 15 defendant has the burden of proving an affirmative defense by 16 a preponderance of the evidence. A person who engages in the 17 violative conduct shall not be held vicariously liable for 18 any nominal, statutory, or compensatory damages incurred by 19 another information content provider; held liable or legally 20 responsible for the conduct of any publisher or speaker of any 21 information provided by another information content provider; 22 or treated as the speaker or publisher of any information 23 provided by another information content provider under any 24 provision of state law. 25 New Code section 146F.8 shall be enforced exclusively 26 through the qui tam action and direct or indirect enforcement 27 of this Code section shall not be taken or threatened. 28 However, the Code section does not preclude or limit the 29 enforcement of any other law or regulation against conduct that 30 is independently prohibited by such other law or regulation, 31 and that would remain prohibited by such other law or 32 regulation in the absence of the Code section. 33 Under new Code section 146F.8, a provider or user of 34 an interactive computer service shall have absolute and 35 -43- LSB 2020YH (3) 91 lh/ko 43/ 51 H.F. 666 nonwaivable immunity from liability or suit on account of 1 an action taken to restrict access to or availability of 2 information or material that assists or facilitates access to 3 elective abortions or abortion-inducing drugs, whether or not 4 such information or material is constitutionally protected; an 5 action taken to enable or make available to information content 6 providers or others the technical means to restrict access 7 to information or material described in the Code section; 8 or a denial of service to those who provide or aid or abet 9 elective abortions, or those who manufacture, mail, distribute, 10 transport, deliver, or provide abortion-inducing drugs.
