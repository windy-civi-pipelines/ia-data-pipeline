6 Section 1. Section 257.10, subsection 9, paragraph a,
7 subparagraph (3), subparagraph divisions (b) and (c), Code
8 2025, are amended to read as follows:
9 (b) The department of management shall categorize all
10 school districts into not more than ten tiers according to each
11 school district’s actual enrollment. Each tier established
12 by the department of management containing a school district
13 with an actual enrollment above three thousand five hundred
14 pupils shall contain, to the extent feasible, the same number
15 of school districts as other tiers containing school districts
16 with an actual enrollment of more than three thousand five
17 hundred pupils. Each tier established by the department
18 of management containing a school district with an actual
19 enrollment equal to or less than three thousand five hundred
20 pupils shall contain, to the extent feasible, the same number
21 of school districts as other tiers containing school districts
22 with an actual enrollment equal to or less than three thousand
23 five hundred pupils.
24 (c) (b) (i) To support school districts with meeting
25 the minimum teacher salary requirements under chapter 284,
26 including the minimum teacher starting salary requirement
27 of fifty thousand dollars; and the minimum teacher salary
28 requirement for full-time teachers with, as of July 1, 2025, at
29 least twelve years of experience of sixty-two thousand dollars
30 under chapter 284; and the minimum teacher salary requirement
31 for teachers with at least twelve years of experience, who
32 have had a bona fide retirement from employment with a covered
33 employer as provided in section 97B.52A, and who have returned
34 to covered employment with a covered employer pursuant to

1 fifty thousand dollars, and other costs associated with such
2 salary requirements, as identified in subparagraph subdivision
3 (ii) including costs associated with the employer’s share of
4 contributions to the Iowa public employees’ retirement system
5 and the employer’s share of the tax imposed by the federal
6 Insurance Contributions Act, the department of management
7 shall calculate and assign to all school districts in a tier
8 established under subparagraph division (b), a teacher salary
9 supplement district cost per pupil in an amount based in part
10 on the average cost to school districts within the tier to meet
11 the requirements, plus an amount equal to the teacher salary
12 supplement supplemental state aid amount for the budget year.
13 (ii) If, however, a school district’s total teacher
14 salary supplement district cost under paragraph “c”, as
15 calculated using the teacher salary supplement district cost
16 per pupil assigned to the school district’s applicable tier,
17 is insufficient to comply with the applicable minimum teacher
18 salary requirements of the school district, including costs
19 associated with the employer’s share of contributions to the
20 Iowa public employees’ retirement system and the employer’s
21 share of the tax imposed by the federal Insurance Contributions
22 Act, the department of management shall set the school
23 district’s teacher salary supplement district cost per pupil
24 at an amount necessary to meet the district’s minimum salary
25 requirements and associated costs. If, however, a school
26 district reported a teacher’s years of experience incorrectly
27 on the fall 2023 basic educational data survey compared to the
28 fall 2024 basic educational data survey, and the difference
29 would have resulted in an additional per pupil amount for
30 the budget year beginning July 1, 2024, the department of
31 management shall increase the teacher salary supplement
32 district cost per pupil for the budget year beginning July 1,
33 2025, by the difference between the teacher salary supplement
34 district cost per pupil that would have been calculated if not
35 for the incorrect reporting and the teacher salary supplement

24 (4) The director of the department of education determines

2 2. A child’s district of residence may place the child in

4 purposes of providing the child with the education required
5 under chapter 256B, subject to the terms of an agreement
6 between the child’s district of residence and the facility or
7 provider. The agreement shall satisfy all of the following
8 requirements:
9 a. The agreement must require the facility or provider to
10 provide periodic invoices to the child’s district of residence
11 that describes the services provided to the child and the cost
12 associated with such services.
13 b. The agreement must condition the child’s district of
14 residence’s payment of the invoice described in paragraph

18 3. a. A child’s district of residence is not financially
19 responsible for the services provided by an out-of-state
20 facility or an out-of-state provider to a child unless the
21 out-of-state facility or out-of-state provider provides notice
22 to the child’s district of residence that the child may be

7 between the amount of the actual costs as reflected in the
8 district of residence’s accounting less the amount generated by
9 the weighting for the provision of services.

11 districts in this state pursuant to paragraph “c” shall be
12 deducted on a monthly basis from the state foundation aid paid
