14 EXPLANATION
15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
16 the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
17 This bill relates to services and support for youth and is
18 organized by divisions.
19 DIVISION I —— TREATMENT, PHYSICAL ASSESSMENTS, AND
20 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EVALUATIONS. Under current law, a
21 psychiatric medical institution for children (PMIC) is an
22 institution providing more than 24 hours of continuous care
23 involving long-term psychiatric services to 3 or more children
24 in residence for expected periods of 14 days or more for
25 diagnosis and evaluation, or for expected periods of 90 days
26 or more for treatment.
27 The bill exempts PMICs from licensing requirements for
28 maintaining or conducting programs with the primary purpose
29 of treating and rehabilitating persons with a substance use
30 disorder.
31 The bill defines “approved qualifying organization” as
32 the joint commission, the commission on the accreditation of
33 rehabilitation facilities, the council on accreditation, a
34 nationally recognized accrediting organization that operates
35 in conformance with federal regulations and has accreditation
LSB 1457XD (16) 91
-33- dg/ko 33/38
S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 standards comparable to the previously mentioned entities, or
2 an entity specified by the department of inspections, appeals,
3 and licensing (DIAL) by rule created in consultation with the
4 department of health and human services (HHS).
5 The bill defines “mental health disorder” as a mental
6 disorder as defined in the most recent version of the
7 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published
8 by the American psychiatric association, or a mental disorder
9 as defined in the most recent version of the international
10 classification of diseases published by the world health
11 organization.
12 The bill defines “protective locked environment” as a
13 setting that prevents egress from a building or grounds as a
14 protective measure to ensure safety and security.
15 The bill defines “record check evaluation system” as the
16 record check evaluation system of HHS used to perform child and
17 dependent adult abuse record checks and to evaluate criminal
18 history and abuse records.
19 The bill defines “serious emotional disturbance disorder”
20 as a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder
21 of sufficient duration to result in a functional impairment
22 and that meets the diagnostic criteria in the most current
23 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published
24 by the American psychiatric association. “Serious emotional
25 disturbance disorder” does not include a substance use or
26 developmental disorder unless such disorder co-occurs with a
27 diagnosable disorder that would otherwise constitute a serious
28 emotional disturbance disorder.
29 The bill defines “substance use disorder” as a diagnosable
30 substance use disorder of sufficient duration to meet
31 diagnostic criteria specified within the most current
32 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published
33 by the American psychiatric association that results in a
34 functional impairment.
35 The bill defines “youth” as a person who is less than 21
LSB 1457XD (16) 91
-34- dg/ko 34/38
S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 years of age.
2 The bill describes the nature of care a PMIC must offer youth
3 with a serious emotional disturbance disorder (SEDD), substance
4 use disorder (SUD), or both.
5 Under current law, a person who establishes a PMIC must
6 also hold a license under Code chapter 237 (child foster
7 care facilities) as a comprehensive residential facility for
8 children, or hold a license under Code chapter 125 (substance
9 use disorders) if the facility provides SUD treatment. The
10 bill eliminates the requirement that a PMIC holds either
11 of these additional licenses, and instead requires that an
12 applicant for a PMIC license specify whether the applicant will
13 provide SEDD services, SUD services, or both. A PMIC may only
14 provide services for which it is licensed.
15 The bill eliminates the requirement that a proposed PMIC be
16 under the direction of an agency which has previously operated
17 a facility for children or adolescents and meets or exceeds
18 requirements for licensure as a comprehensive residential
19 facility for children.
20 The bill requires DIAL, in cooperation with HHS, to adopt
21 rules to allow a PMIC to use a protective locked environment
22 at the PMIC.
23 Under current law, following the hospitalization hearing
24 on an involuntary commitment petition, if the court finds
25 by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent has a
26 serious mental impairment, the court shall order the respondent
27 committed for a complete psychiatric evaluation and appropriate
28 treatment. The chief medical officer (CMO) of the hospital or
29 facility at which a respondent is committed must report to the
30 court no more than 15 days after the date the respondent is
31 placed, making a recommendation for disposition of the matter.
32 The bill allows a court to place a minor respondent in a public
33 hospital and allows a CMO of the hospital no more than 30
34 days after the date the minor respondent is placed to make a
35 recommendation for disposition of the matter.

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 The bill defines “behavioral health evaluation” as a
2 comprehensive evaluation of a person’s mental and behavioral
3 health by a person licensed under Code chapter 154B
4 (psychology), 154C (social work), or 154D (behavioral science)
5 for purposes including but not limited to identifying a
6 possible behavioral health condition.
7 The bill defines “physical assessment” as direct physical
8 touching, viewing, and medically necessary manipulation of any
9 area of a child’s body by a licensed physician.
10 The bill also defines “behavioral health condition” for
11 purposes of Code chapter 232 (juvenile justice).
12 The bill replaces several references to a physical or mental
13 examination with references to a physical assessment (PA) or
14 behavioral health evaluation (BHE) and replaces references to a
15 person’s abuse of alcohol or other controlled substances with
16 references to the person having a behavioral health condition.
17 Under current law, one of several specific circumstances
18 must exist before a juvenile court has the authority to enter
19 an ex parte order to direct a peace officer or a juvenile court
20 officer to take custody of a child before or after the filing
21 of a petition under Code chapter 232 (juvenile justice). The
22 bill adds the circumstance when the child’s parent, guardian,
23 or legal custodian consents to the removal as a condition that
24 would permit a juvenile court to enter such an ex parte order.
25 The bill creates similar provisions for when a juvenile court
26 may enter an ex parte order for a child to undergo an inpatient
27 PA or an inpatient BHE and when a person authorized to conduct
28 a preliminary investigation in response to a complaint
29 may motion to ask the court to order a child to undergo an
30 inpatient PA or an inpatient BHE.
31 The bill authorizes a court, after a dispositional hearing,
32 to order a child in a child in need of assistance (CINA)
33 proceeding or a family in need of assistance (FINA) proceeding
34 to receive an inpatient PA, an inpatient BHE, or both, at the
35 state training school (STS) if HHS requests such an order.

1 A child ordered to the STS pursuant to a CINA proceeding
2 or a FINA proceeding must be separated at all times from
3 children placed in the STS pursuant to a juvenile delinquency
4 proceeding. Under current law, the court in a CINA or FINA
5 proceeding is prohibited from placing a child in the STS for
6 any reason.
7 The bill exempts a PMIC from licensing requirements for
8 child foster care.
9 The bill directs HHS and DIAL to adopt rules pertaining to
10 the use of seclusion and restraints at certain facilities as
11 detailed in the bill.
12 The bill makes conforming changes to Code chapters 135H
13 (psychiatric medical institutions for children) and 232
14 (juvenile justice). The bill repeals 2024 Iowa Acts, chapter
15 1161, sections 97 and 98.
16 DIVISION II —— EXEMPTION FROM CHILDREN’S RESIDENTIAL
17 FACILITY CERTIFICATION. The bill provides an exception from
18 the definition of “children’s residential facility” under Code
19 chapter 237C, for care furnished by a live-in facility that
20 provides intensive medical care and support for individuals
21 who require ongoing treatment if the facility only furnishes
22 care to persons 16 years of age and older and HHS is paying for
23 each person’s care from the facility under a federally approved
24 home and community-based services waiver or under another
25 provision of the medical assistance program. By operation of
26 law, the excepted live-in facilities are exempt from children’s
27 residential facility requirements, including certification.
28 DIVISION III —— DIRECTOR OF JUVENILE COURT SERVICES ——
29 CHIEF JUVENILE COURT OFFICERS. Under current law, the chief
30 juvenile court officers are appointed, terminated for cause,
31 and otherwise act under the direction and supervision of the
32 chief judge for the judicial district in which the chief
33 juvenile court officer was appointed. The bill transfers the
34 chief judges’ authority over chief juvenile court officers to
35 the director of juvenile court services.

1 DIVISION IV —— HAWKI ELIGIBILITY —— PUBLIC INSTITUTION
2 INMATES. The bill defines “public institution” to mean the
3 same as defined in 42 C.F.R. §435.1010.
4 Current law does not permit a child who is an inmate in a
5 public institution to be eligible for the Hawki program. The
6 bill requires HHS to suspend, but not terminate, Hawki program
7 eligibility for a child in a public institution if the child
8 is otherwise eligible for the Hawki program except for the
9 child’s status as an inmate, the child was enrolled in the
10 Hawki program at the time the child was committed to the public
11 institution, and 30 calendar days have elapsed since the date
12 the child was committed to the public institution. A child’s
13 suspension of Hawki benefits must continue for the duration of
14 the child’s commitment to a public institution.
15 The bill requires the public institution to which a child
16 is committed and HHS to provide monthly reports and expedite
17 the restoration of the child’s Hawki benefits upon the child’s
18 discharge from the public institution. The bill requires HHS
19 to adopt rules to administer the bill’s provisions related to
20 Hawki benefits for children committed to a public institution.
21 DIVISION V —— CORRECTIVE CHANGES. The bill updates
22 references to certain accrediting organizations through the
23 Code, corrects a reference throughout the Code related to
24 the citation for the definition of “reasonable efforts”,
25 and changes the term “legal custodian” to the defined term
26 “custodian”.

14 EXPLANATION
15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
16 the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
17 This bill relates to services and support for youth and is
18 organized by divisions.
19 DIVISION I —— TREATMENT, PHYSICAL ASSESSMENTS, AND
20 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EVALUATIONS. Under current law, a
21 psychiatric medical institution for children (PMIC) is an
22 institution providing more than 24 hours of continuous care
23 involving long-term psychiatric services to 3 or more children
24 in residence for expected periods of 14 days or more for
25 diagnosis and evaluation, or for expected periods of 90 days
26 or more for treatment.
27 The bill exempts PMICs from licensing requirements for
28 maintaining or conducting programs with the primary purpose
29 of treating and rehabilitating persons with a substance use
30 disorder.
31 The bill defines “approved qualifying organization” as
32 the joint commission, the commission on the accreditation of
33 rehabilitation facilities, the council on accreditation, a
34 nationally recognized accrediting organization that operates
35 in conformance with federal regulations and has accreditation

1 standards comparable to the previously mentioned entities, or
2 an entity specified by the department of inspections, appeals,
3 and licensing (DIAL) by rule created in consultation with the
4 department of health and human services (HHS).
5 The bill defines “mental health disorder” as a mental
6 disorder as defined in the most recent version of the
7 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published
8 by the American psychiatric association, or a mental disorder
9 as defined in the most recent version of the international
10 classification of diseases published by the world health
11 organization.
12 The bill defines “protective locked environment” as a
13 setting that prevents egress from a building or grounds as a
14 protective measure to ensure safety and security.
15 The bill defines “record check evaluation system” as the
16 record check evaluation system of HHS used to perform child and
17 dependent adult abuse record checks and to evaluate criminal
18 history and abuse records.
19 The bill defines “serious emotional disturbance disorder”
20 as a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder
21 of sufficient duration to result in a functional impairment
22 and that meets the diagnostic criteria in the most current
23 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published
24 by the American psychiatric association. “Serious emotional
25 disturbance disorder” does not include a substance use or
26 developmental disorder unless such disorder co-occurs with a
27 diagnosable disorder that would otherwise constitute a serious
28 emotional disturbance disorder.
29 The bill defines “substance use disorder” as a diagnosable
30 substance use disorder of sufficient duration to meet
31 diagnostic criteria specified within the most current
32 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published
33 by the American psychiatric association that results in a
34 functional impairment.
35 The bill defines “youth” as a person who is less than 21
LSB 1457XD (16) 91
-34- dg/ko 34/38

S.F. _____ H.F. _____
1 years of age.
2 The bill describes the nature of care a PMIC must offer youth
3 with a serious emotional disturbance disorder (SEDD), substance
4 use disorder (SUD), or both.
5 Under current law, a person who establishes a PMIC must
6 also hold a license under Code chapter 237 (child foster
7 care facilities) as a comprehensive residential facility for
8 children, or hold a license under Code chapter 125 (substance
9 use disorders) if the facility provides SUD treatment. The
10 bill eliminates the requirement that a PMIC holds either
11 of these additional licenses, and instead requires that an
12 applicant for a PMIC license specify whether the applicant will
13 provide SEDD services, SUD services, or both. A PMIC may only
14 provide services for which it is licensed.
15 The bill eliminates the requirement that a proposed PMIC be
16 under the direction of an agency which has previously operated
17 a facility for children or adolescents and meets or exceeds
18 requirements for licensure as a comprehensive residential
19 facility for children.
20 The bill requires DIAL, in cooperation with HHS, to adopt
21 rules to allow a PMIC to use a protective locked environment
22 at the PMIC.
23 Under current law, following the hospitalization hearing
24 on an involuntary commitment petition, if the court finds
25 by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent has a
26 serious mental impairment, the court shall order the respondent
27 committed for a complete psychiatric evaluation and appropriate
28 treatment. The chief medical officer (CMO) of the hospital or
29 facility at which a respondent is committed must report to the
30 court no more than 15 days after the date the respondent is
31 placed, making a recommendation for disposition of the matter.
32 The bill allows a court to place a minor respondent in a public
33 hospital and allows a CMO of the hospital no more than 30
34 days after the date the minor respondent is placed to make a
35 recommendation for disposition of the matter.

2 comprehensive evaluation of a person’s mental and behavioral
3 health by a person licensed under Code chapter 154B
4 (psychology), 154C (social work), or 154D (behavioral science)
5 for purposes including but not limited to identifying a
6 possible behavioral health condition.
7 The bill defines “physical assessment” as direct physical
8 touching, viewing, and medically necessary manipulation of any
9 area of a child’s body by a licensed physician.
10 The bill also defines “behavioral health condition” for
11 purposes of Code chapter 232 (juvenile justice).
12 The bill replaces several references to a physical or mental
13 examination with references to a physical assessment (PA) or
14 behavioral health evaluation (BHE) and replaces references to a
15 person’s abuse of alcohol or other controlled substances with
16 references to the person having a behavioral health condition.
17 Under current law, one of several specific circumstances
18 must exist before a juvenile court has the authority to enter
19 an ex parte order to direct a peace officer or a juvenile court
20 officer to take custody of a child before or after the filing
21 of a petition under Code chapter 232 (juvenile justice). The
22 bill adds the circumstance when the child’s parent, guardian,
23 or legal custodian consents to the removal as a condition that
24 would permit a juvenile court to enter such an ex parte order.
25 The bill creates similar provisions for when a juvenile court
26 may enter an ex parte order for a child to undergo an inpatient
27 PA or an inpatient BHE and when a person authorized to conduct
28 a preliminary investigation in response to a complaint
29 may motion to ask the court to order a child to undergo an
30 inpatient PA or an inpatient BHE.
31 The bill authorizes a court, after a dispositional hearing,
32 to order a child in a child in need of assistance (CINA)
33 proceeding or a family in need of assistance (FINA) proceeding
34 to receive an inpatient PA, an inpatient BHE, or both, at the
35 state training school (STS) if HHS requests such an order.

5 proceeding is prohibited from placing a child in the STS for
6 any reason.
7 The bill exempts a PMIC from licensing requirements for
8 child foster care.
9 The bill directs HHS and DIAL to adopt rules pertaining to
10 the use of seclusion and restraints at certain facilities as
11 detailed in the bill.
12 The bill makes conforming changes to Code chapters 135H
13 (psychiatric medical institutions for children) and 232
14 (juvenile justice). The bill repeals 2024 Iowa Acts, chapter
15 1161, sections 97 and 98.
16 DIVISION II —— EXEMPTION FROM CHILDREN’S RESIDENTIAL
17 FACILITY CERTIFICATION. The bill provides an exception from
18 the definition of “children’s residential facility” under Code
19 chapter 237C, for care furnished by a live-in facility that
20 provides intensive medical care and support for individuals
21 who require ongoing treatment if the facility only furnishes
22 care to persons 16 years of age and older and HHS is paying for
23 each person’s care from the facility under a federally approved
24 home and community-based services waiver or under another
25 provision of the medical assistance program. By operation of
26 law, the excepted live-in facilities are exempt from children’s
27 residential facility requirements, including certification.
28 DIVISION III —— DIRECTOR OF JUVENILE COURT SERVICES ——
29 CHIEF JUVENILE COURT OFFICERS. Under current law, the chief
30 juvenile court officers are appointed, terminated for cause,
31 and otherwise act under the direction and supervision of the
32 chief judge for the judicial district in which the chief
33 juvenile court officer was appointed. The bill transfers the
34 chief judges’ authority over chief juvenile court officers to
35 the director of juvenile court services.

1 DIVISION IV —— HAWKI ELIGIBILITY —— PUBLIC INSTITUTION
2 INMATES. The bill defines “public institution” to mean the
3 same as defined in 42 C.F.R. §435.1010.
4 Current law does not permit a child who is an inmate in a
5 public institution to be eligible for the Hawki program. The
6 bill requires HHS to suspend, but not terminate, Hawki program
7 eligibility for a child in a public institution if the child
8 is otherwise eligible for the Hawki program except for the
9 child’s status as an inmate, the child was enrolled in the
10 Hawki program at the time the child was committed to the public
11 institution, and 30 calendar days have elapsed since the date
12 the child was committed to the public institution. A child’s
13 suspension of Hawki benefits must continue for the duration of
14 the child’s commitment to a public institution.
15 The bill requires the public institution to which a child
16 is committed and HHS to provide monthly reports and expedite
17 the restoration of the child’s Hawki benefits upon the child’s
18 discharge from the public institution. The bill requires HHS
19 to adopt rules to administer the bill’s provisions related to
20 Hawki benefits for children committed to a public institution.
21 DIVISION V —— CORRECTIVE CHANGES. The bill updates
22 references to certain accrediting organizations through the
23 Code, corrects a reference throughout the Code related to
24 the citation for the definition of “reasonable efforts”,
25 and changes the term “legal custodian” to the defined term
26 “custodian”.
