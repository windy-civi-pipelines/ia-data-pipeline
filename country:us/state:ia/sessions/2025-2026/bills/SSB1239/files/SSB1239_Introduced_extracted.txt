By 17 November 1, 2029, and by November 1 each year thereafter, 18 the department of management shall determine the amount of 19 moneys available in the ITEF, and the net individual income 20 tax receipts at the close of the preceding fiscal year. The 21 amount available in the ITEF and the net tax receipts shall be 22 provided to the department of revenue for the calculation to 23 determine if the individual income tax rate may be adjusted. 24 The bill specifies the department of revenue shall adjust and 25 apply a new individual income tax rate in such a way that the 26 rate would have generated an amount equal to the net receipts 27 generated from the rate in the preceding fiscal year less the 28 amount transferred from the ITEF. 29 The bill prohibits the individual income tax rate from being 30 adjusted unless the amount of net sales and use tax revenue 31 collected by the state during the most recent October 1 through 32 September 30 calculation period is greater than 103 percent 33 of the net sales and use tax revenue collected during the 34 preceding calculation period covering the same months. 35 -19- LSB 2989XC (4) 91 jm/jh 19/ 20 S.F. _____ The bill prohibits the rate from being adjusted unless the 1 rate is able to be adjusted at least one-tenth of 1 percent. 2 The rate, when adjusted, shall be rounded down to the nearest 3 one-tenth of 1 percent. 4 The bill prohibits the rate from being adjusted unless there 5 is less than $450 million in the ITEF, excluding the amount in 6 the expense account, and at least 150 percent of the amount to 7 be transferred to the general fund of the state is available 8 in the ITEF. 9 The bill requires the moneys in the ITEF be transferred to 10 the general fund of the state in the fiscal year the rate is 11 adjusted. The bill specifies the transfer from the ITEF to the 12 general fund of the state shall not be considered ânew revenueâ 13 for purposes of the general fund expenditure limitation in Code 14 section 8.54. 15 If the rate is adjusted downward pursuant to the bill, the 16 alternate state individual income tax rate shall be adjusted 17 downward in the same proportion to the nearest one-tenth of 1 18 percent. 19 If a tax rate is adjusted, the bill requires the director 20 of revenue to cause an advisory notice containing the new 21 individual income tax rate and alternate tax rate to be 22 published in the Iowa administrative bulletin and on the 23 internet site of the department of revenue. The calculation 24 and publication of the adjusted tax rates by the director 25 of revenue is exempt from Code chapter 17A, and shall be 26 submitted for publication by the first December 31 following 27 the determination date to adjust the tax rates. 28 -20- LSB 2989XC (4) 91 jm/jh 20/ 20

The 21 amount available in the ITEF and the net tax receipts shall be 22 provided to the department of revenue for the calculation to 23 determine if the individual income tax rate may be adjusted. 24 The bill specifies the department of revenue shall adjust and 25 apply a new individual income tax rate in such a way that the 26 rate would have generated an amount equal to the net receipts 27 generated from the rate in the preceding fiscal year less the 28 amount transferred from the ITEF. 29 The bill prohibits the individual income tax rate from being 30 adjusted unless the amount of net sales and use tax revenue 31 collected by the state during the most recent October 1 through 32 September 30 calculation period is greater than 103 percent 33 of the net sales and use tax revenue collected during the 34 preceding calculation period covering the same months. 35 -19- LSB 2989XC (4) 91 jm/jh 19/ 20 S.F. _____ The bill prohibits the rate from being adjusted unless the 1 rate is able to be adjusted at least one-tenth of 1 percent. 2 The rate, when adjusted, shall be rounded down to the nearest 3 one-tenth of 1 percent. 4 The bill prohibits the rate from being adjusted unless there 5 is less than $450 million in the ITEF, excluding the amount in 6 the expense account, and at least 150 percent of the amount to 7 be transferred to the general fund of the state is available 8 in the ITEF. 9 The bill requires the moneys in the ITEF be transferred to 10 the general fund of the state in the fiscal year the rate is 11 adjusted. The bill specifies the transfer from the ITEF to the 12 general fund of the state shall not be considered ânew revenueâ 13 for purposes of the general fund expenditure limitation in Code 14 section 8.54. 15 If the rate is adjusted downward pursuant to the bill, the 16 alternate state individual income tax rate shall be adjusted 17 downward in the same proportion to the nearest one-tenth of 1 18 percent. 19 If a tax rate is adjusted, the bill requires the director 20 of revenue to cause an advisory notice containing the new 21 individual income tax rate and alternate tax rate to be 22 published in the Iowa administrative bulletin and on the 23 internet site of the department of revenue.
