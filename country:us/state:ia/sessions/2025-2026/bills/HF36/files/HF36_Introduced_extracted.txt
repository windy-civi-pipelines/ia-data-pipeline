If interpretation 1 of the provision of law has not been clearly vested in the 2 discretion of the agency, the standard of review is instead 3 whether the agencyâs interpretation is erroneous. Current law 4 also provides standards for a court regarding the determination 5 of the degree of deference to be given to the view of an agency, 6 based on whether a provision of law has vested the agency with 7 discretion over the matter in question. The bill strikes these 8 provisions and instead provides that a court must reverse, 9 modify, or grant other appropriate relief from agency action 10 based upon an erroneous interpretation of a provision of law. 11 The bill additionally prohibits a court, or a presiding 12 officer in a contested case or other administrative action 13 subject to Code chapter 17A, when interpreting a state statute 14 or a rule or other agency document subject to Code chapter 17A, 15 from deferring to an agencyâs interpretation of the statute, 16 rule, or document; the bill instead requires the court or 17 officer to interpret its meaning and effect de novo. The 18 bill requires the court or officer, in an action brought by 19 or against an agency, after applying all customary tools of 20 interpretation, to exercise any remaining doubt in favor of a 21 reasonable interpretation that limits agency authority. 22 -2- LSB 1539YH (2) 91 je/ko 2/ 2
