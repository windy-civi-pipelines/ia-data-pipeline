For 5 purposes of an application for and issuance of a class âAâ 6 native distilled spirits license, the bill modifies the term 7 âpremisesâ to include, in addition to the definition in Code 8 section 123.3, any number of locations which are only separated 9 from the premises by public waterways, roads, or carrier 10 rights-of-way, any number of locations in the same general 11 location as the premises, and an additional warehouse or 12 warehouses located elsewhere, if approved by the alcohol and 13 tobacco tax and trade bureau of the United States department of 14 the treasury (bureau). 15 Under current law, the following retail alcohol licenses 16 may be issued to native manufacturers for the same premises 17 where manufacturing occurs: a native distillery may be granted 18 not more than two class âCâ retail alcohol licenses, a native 19 brewery may be granted not more than two class âCâ retail 20 alcohol licenses or two special class âCâ retail alcohol 21 licenses, and a native winery may be granted not more than 22 two class âCâ retail alcohol licenses or two special class 23 âCâ retail native wine licenses. A class âCâ retail alcohol 24 license allows for the sale and on-premises consumption of 25 alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer and the sale of alcoholic 26 liquor, wine, and beer in original unopened containers for 27 consumption off the premises. A special class âCâ retail 28 alcohol license allows for the sale and consumption of wine 29 and beer on the premises and the sale of wine and beer in 30 original unopened containers for consumption off the premises. 31 A special class âCâ retail native wine license allows beer and 32 native wine to be sold for on- or off-premises consumption. 33 The bill allows native manufacturers to be issued not more than 34 three of the currently authorized retail alcohol licenses. 35 -7- LSB 2678SV (2) 91 ll/ns 7/ 8 S.F. 584 Under current law, a class âAâ beer permit holder who also 1 holds a brewerâs notice issued by the bureau, also known as a 2 native brewery, is authorized to sell, at wholesale, no more 3 than 30,000 barrels of beer on an annual basis to off-premises 4 licensees. The bill increases this to no more than 38,000 5 barrels of beer. 6 The bill imposes a manufacturing limit on a wine 7 manufacturer that holds a class âAâ wine permit and a basic 8 permit issued by the bureau of no more than 150,000 gallons of 9 wine annually. 10 The bill eliminates the $10,000 bond requirement for class 11 âAâ beer permit holders and the $5,000 bond requirement for 12 class âAâ wine permit holders. 13 -8- LSB 2678SV (2) 91 ll/ns 8/ 8
