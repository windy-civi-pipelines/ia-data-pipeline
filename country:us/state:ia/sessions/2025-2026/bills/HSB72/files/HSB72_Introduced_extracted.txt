The section of this Act enacting section 8.95. 7 3. The section of this Act enacting section 8.96. 8 EXPLANATION 9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 10 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 11 This bill relates to matters under the purview of the 12 department of management (DOM). 13 Under current law, the governorâs budget recommendation is 14 considered confidential by the legislative services agency 15 until it is made public by the governor. The bill states that 16 information transmitted by state entities to DOM for developing 17 the budget as required by law, and documents based on the 18 transmittals, are confidential until the governor transmits the 19 budget to the general assembly. 20 The bill strikes current law providing for the use of moneys 21 in the technology reinvestment fund for certain technology 22 projects and instead appropriates moneys in the fund to DOM for 23 technology projects using factors set forth in the bill. The 24 bill requires DOM to provide a prioritized list of proposed 25 projects to the governor, who must use the list to develop 26 a budgetary recommendation to the general assembly, and to 27 report completed and ongoing projects to the general assembly 28 annually. 29 The bill increases the frequency at which a person 30 performing work for DOM or an individual on the information 31 technology staff of a supported entity may be subject to a 32 national criminal history check through the federal bureau of 33 investigation from at least once every 10 years to every 5 34 years. 35 -13- LSB 1362XD (7) 91 sc/ns 13/ 15 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ The bill prohibits the inclusion of certain provisions in 1 information technology contracts and declares those provisions 2 void if present in such contracts. The bill also provides that 3 such contracts are deemed to include provisions requiring the 4 contract to be governed by Iowa law and litigation related to 5 the contract to be brought and maintained in Polk county. The 6 bill authorizes the director of DOM to include limitations of 7 vendor liability in information technology goods and services 8 contracts, but sets forth prohibited terms in such limitations 9 of liability. 10 The bill makes all communication concerning cybersecurity 11 between the chief information security officer and other 12 entities confidential and allows the communications to be 13 released only for specific purposes. 14 Under current law, the department of health and human 15 services serves as the Iowa statistical analysis center and 16 maintains an integrated information system for data sharing 17 among federal, state, and local governments. The bill 18 transfers these powers and duties to DOM and grants DOM access 19 to criminal justice information other than intelligence data 20 and peace officer investigative reports maintained by the 21 department of public safety. DOM is authorized to provide 22 data analysis and reporting on issues that may affect the 23 stateâs correctional population and various subgroups of the 24 population, to maintain a multiagency information system to 25 track the progress of juveniles and adults charged with a 26 criminal offense through state and local agencies and programs, 27 and to count and track decision points for individuals in 28 the juvenile justice system, child welfare system, and 29 court system. If DOM lacks sufficient moneys to perform the 30 authorized tasks of the Iowa statistical analysis center, the 31 bill allows DOM to determine which, if any, to implement. 32 The bill states that DOM is not the lawful custodian under 33 Code chapter 22 (open records) for records DOM maintains in 34 DOMâs information technology capacity for other state entities 35 -14- LSB 1362XD (7) 91 sc/ns 14/ 15 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ as an automated data processing unit of government or when 1 held by DOM solely for storage for another department or 2 establishment. The bill requires DOM to deny requests for 3 information for which DOM is not the lawful custodian, to 4 provide assistance to the lawful custodian to comply with 5 production obligations, and to cooperate in any efforts to 6 resist associated subpoenas. 7 -15- LSB 1362XD (7) 91 sc/ns 15/ 15

The following apply to contracts 3 entered into or renewed on or after the effective date of this 4 Act: 5 1. The section of this Act enacting section 8.94. 6 2. The section of this Act enacting section 8.95. 7 3. The section of this Act enacting section 8.96. 8 EXPLANATION 9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with 10 the explanationâs substance by the members of the general assembly. 11 This bill relates to matters under the purview of the 12 department of management (DOM). 13 Under current law, the governorâs budget recommendation is 14 considered confidential by the legislative services agency 15 until it is made public by the governor. The bill states that 16 information transmitted by state entities to DOM for developing 17 the budget as required by law, and documents based on the 18 transmittals, are confidential until the governor transmits the 19 budget to the general assembly. 20 The bill strikes current law providing for the use of moneys 21 in the technology reinvestment fund for certain technology 22 projects and instead appropriates moneys in the fund to DOM for 23 technology projects using factors set forth in the bill. The 24 bill requires DOM to provide a prioritized list of proposed 25 projects to the governor, who must use the list to develop 26 a budgetary recommendation to the general assembly, and to 27 report completed and ongoing projects to the general assembly 28 annually. 29 The bill increases the frequency at which a person 30 performing work for DOM or an individual on the information 31 technology staff of a supported entity may be subject to a 32 national criminal history check through the federal bureau of 33 investigation from at least once every 10 years to every 5 34 years. 35 -13- LSB 1362XD (7) 91 sc/ns 13/ 15 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ The bill prohibits the inclusion of certain provisions in 1 information technology contracts and declares those provisions 2 void if present in such contracts.

The 6 bill authorizes the director of DOM to include limitations of 7 vendor liability in information technology goods and services 8 contracts, but sets forth prohibited terms in such limitations 9 of liability. 10 The bill makes all communication concerning cybersecurity 11 between the chief information security officer and other 12 entities confidential and allows the communications to be 13 released only for specific purposes. 14 Under current law, the department of health and human 15 services serves as the Iowa statistical analysis center and 16 maintains an integrated information system for data sharing 17 among federal, state, and local governments. The bill 18 transfers these powers and duties to DOM and grants DOM access 19 to criminal justice information other than intelligence data 20 and peace officer investigative reports maintained by the 21 department of public safety. DOM is authorized to provide 22 data analysis and reporting on issues that may affect the 23 stateâs correctional population and various subgroups of the 24 population, to maintain a multiagency information system to 25 track the progress of juveniles and adults charged with a 26 criminal offense through state and local agencies and programs, 27 and to count and track decision points for individuals in 28 the juvenile justice system, child welfare system, and 29 court system. If DOM lacks sufficient moneys to perform the 30 authorized tasks of the Iowa statistical analysis center, the 31 bill allows DOM to determine which, if any, to implement. 32 The bill states that DOM is not the lawful custodian under 33 Code chapter 22 (open records) for records DOM maintains in 34 DOMâs information technology capacity for other state entities 35 -14- LSB 1362XD (7) 91 sc/ns 14/ 15 S.F. _____ H.F. _____ as an automated data processing unit of government or when 1 held by DOM solely for storage for another department or 2 establishment.
